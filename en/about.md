# An Objective "Yardstick" for Audio Selection
{: .about-title}

## Who Is This Site For?

### Recommended For
‚Ä¢ Those who want to know absolute evaluations of audio equipment based on measurable, reproducible, objective scientific indicators for purchase consideration, and want to minimize the effort required for such information gathering.

### Not Recommended For
‚Ä¢ Those who seek non-sound-related values in audio equipment such as design/interior aesthetics, material quantity investment, expensive materials, nostalgia, vintage, etc., or those who prioritize subjective evaluations that go against scientific transparency

The world is flooded with audio reviews.  
"Deep, immersive sound," "high resolution"... these words alone don't really tell you whether a product is truly right for you.

This site is an audio review site designed for people like you.

We evaluate audio products and companies fairly, based on **"scientific perspectives"** and **"thorough web research"**, without being swayed by subjective impressions, brand images, or outdated theories.

We care about only one thing: **"benefit to our readers"**.  
We have zero bias toward manufacturers. We review honestly and straightforwardly based on facts‚Äîgood products are good, and those that aren't, aren't.

## Our Unique Evaluation Criteria

We take a **data-first meta-review approach** and evaluate products and companies using the following five objective metrics:

### 1. Scientific Validity: Can It Really Be Confirmed That It Sounds Better?
We provide absolute evaluation based on independent third-party measurements such as frequency response, distortion, S/N ratio, crosstalk, and dynamic range, as well as ABX blind test results for audible differences. Products with measurement values exceeding problematic levels or claiming effects that cannot be distinguished receive low ratings, while products achieving transparent-level measurements or producing clearly distinguishable effects receive high ratings. Analog records and vacuum tubes are also strictly evaluated based on measurement data.

### 2. Technical Level: Is That Technology at Industry-Leading Standards?
We evaluate proprietary patented technologies, in-house design, adoption of latest technologies, and whether other companies would want to follow the technology. We analyze whether truly innovative and valuable technology has been invested, rather than just assembling OEM products.

### 3. Cost Performance: Is That Price Reasonable Compared to the World's Cheapest Product with Equivalent Performance?
Calculated using **`World's cheapest product price with equivalent performance √∑ Price of the reviewed product`**. If no product with equivalent or better functionality and measurement performance exists globally, the score is 1.0. If such products exist, evaluation is based on the price ratio. Brand value, internal construction, design, etc. are not considered at all‚Äîwe measure pure price efficiency for achieving equivalent functionality and measurement performance.

### 4. Reliability & Support: Is There Quality and Support Infrastructure That Can Withstand Long-term Use?
We comprehensively evaluate failure rates, warranty periods, repair systems, firmware update frequency, and customer support quality. We emphasize actual failure data and the adequacy of support infrastructure.

### 5. Rationality of Design Philosophy: Is That Design Approach Scientifically Sound?
We strictly evaluate whether the design directly contributes to measurable or audible sound quality improvements or cost reductions. Irrational designs with unscientific elements or unproven effects, regardless of price, receive low ratings.

## Scoring System

Each of the five evaluation criteria above is scored on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. The sum of these scores is displayed as an overall rating from 0.0 to 5.0.

The four evaluation criteria other than cost performance (Scientific Validity, Technical Level, Reliability & Support, and Rationality of Design Philosophy) can be approximately interpreted as follows:
- **0.8-1.0**: Excellent
- **0.6-0.8**: Good
- **0.4-0.6**: Average
- **0.2-0.4**: Poor
- **0.0-0.2**: Significantly poor

The overall rating is the sum of the five criteria, resulting in a maximum of 5.0 points and a minimum of 0.0 points.
2.5 is the baseline, with ratings of approximately 3.0 or higher indicating high evaluation, and 4.0 or higher indicating very high evaluation.

## Limitations

Due to the nature of this site as a meta-review platform, the review quality for products with insufficient information available on the internet (such as minor products without third-party measurements or reviews, or newly released products) may be lower.

## Using the Company and Product Lists

1. **Search**: Click the magnifying glass in the page header or the "Search" link in the navigation bar to open the search window. Enter at least two characters to search company names, product names, summaries, and tags.

2. **Sorting**: Use the "Sort by" dropdown at the top of each list page. You can sort alphabetically, by update date, by overall rating, or by any individual metric. The selected sort order is reflected in the page URL so it can be bookmarked.

3. **Tag Filtering**: Select "üè∑Ô∏è Filter by Tags" to open the tag panel. Check one or more tags to narrow the list and use the AND/OR toggle to change the filtering logic. Selected tags are also stored in the URL for easy sharing.

4. **Rating Filtering**: Click "‚≠ê Filter by Rating" to open the rating panel. Use sliders to set ranges for overall rating and individual evaluation criteria (Scientific Validity, Technical Level, Cost Performance, Reliability & Support, Design Rationality). For example, you can filter for products with "Overall Rating 3.0 or higher" or "Cost Performance 0.7 or higher."

5. **Price Filtering** (Products only): Click "üí∞ Filter by Price" to open the price panel. Use sliders to set price ranges and find products within your budget. Prices are displayed on a logarithmic scale, allowing fine adjustment from low to high price ranges.

6. **Combining Features**: Search, sorting, tag filtering, rating filtering, and price filtering can be combined for more precise product selection. For example, select the "Wireless" tag, filter by "Overall Rating 3.5 or higher" and "Price under $1,000," then sort by "Cost Performance (High to Low)" to quickly compare high-rated, affordable wireless products. All conditions are reflected in the URL for easy sharing and bookmarking.

The most expensive product isn't necessarily the best product for you.  
We hope our reviews serve as a reliable "yardstick" to help you find the one product that truly offers value for you.
