# An Objective "Yardstick" for Audio Selection
{: .about-title}

The world is flooded with audio reviews.  
"Deep, immersive sound," "high resolution"... these words alone don't really tell you whether a product is truly right for you.

This site is an audio review site designed for people like you.

We evaluate audio products and companies fairly, based on **"scientific perspectives"** and **"thorough web research"**, without being swayed by subjective impressions, brand images, or outdated theories.

We care about only one thing: **"benefit to our readers"**.  
We have zero bias toward manufacturers. We review honestly and straightforwardly based on facts—good products are good, and those that aren't, aren't.

## Our Unique Evaluation Criteria

We evaluate and score all products and companies using the following five objective metrics:

### 1. Scientific Validity: Can You Really Hear That "Better Sound"?
We focus on whether a significant difference can be confirmed in blind tests and whether claims are supported by objective measurement data. **We do not value scientifically unsubstantiated myths**, such as "analog sounds warmer than digital" or "cables made of specific materials sound better."

### 2. Technical Level: Is the Technology Truly Advanced?
Instead of valuing sheer size, weight, or old traditions, we assess how original and rational a design is from the perspective of the latest technological standards. We analyze whether genuinely valuable technology has been invested, rather than just assembling OEM components.

### 3. Cost Performance: Is the Price Justified by Its Performance?
We calculate cost performance using the formula: **`Price of the world's cheapest product with equivalent performance ÷ Price of the product you are considering`**. We do not include brand value or design in our evaluation, but judge the fairness of the price for pure performance by comparing it with all products on the market (including inexpensive ones).

### 4. Reliability & Support: Can You Use It with Confidence Long-term?
We evaluate not only the manufacturer's published specifications but also long-term reliability, based on real user reviews of failure rates, warranty periods, repair systems, and firmware update frequency.

### 5. Rationality of Design Philosophy: Does That "Premium Feature" Really Contribute to Sound Quality?
We rigorously evaluate whether the specifications and component choices claimed to produce "high-quality sound" are genuinely scientifically and technically sound. We do not credit occult claims or irrational designs whose effects cannot be proven, even in expensive products.

## Scoring System

Each of the five evaluation criteria above is scored on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. The sum of these scores is displayed as an overall rating from 0.0 to 5.0.

The four evaluation criteria other than cost performance (Scientific Validity, Technical Level, Reliability & Support, and Rationality of Design Philosophy) are scored as follows:
- **0.0-0.2**: Significantly poor
- **0.2-0.4**: Poor
- **0.4-0.6**: Average
- **0.6-0.8**: Good
- **0.8-1.0**: Excellent

The overall rating is the sum of the five criteria, resulting in a maximum of 5.0 points and a minimum of 0.0 points.

The most expensive product isn't necessarily the best product for you.  
We hope our reviews serve as a reliable "yardstick" to help you find the one product that truly offers value for you.
