summary: "The Fink Team KIM is a bookshelf speaker featuring an 8-inch woofer and an AMT tweeter. While its acoustic design is rational, measured performance does not clearly justify the 11,995 USD asking price. With alternatives offering equivalent or better performance at a fraction of the cost, it presents serious cost-performance issues."

## Overview

The Fink Team KIM is a bookshelf speaker developed by German audio manufacturer Fink Team. It features a 2-way bass-reflex design with an 8-inch woofer and a 110mm AMT (Air Motion Transformer) tweeter, and includes dedicated stands. It inherits design philosophy from the company's Borg speaker and is positioned for the high-end market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Published data shows a frequency range of 35Hz–25kHz (-10dB), which is standard for speakers. Sensitivity is 86dB (2.83V/1m), and the minimum impedance of 5.9Ω is not a demanding load for typical amplifiers. THD at 1W is quoted at 0.2%, which is average for speakers based on the policy’s category notes (≤0.1% excellent, ≥1% problematic). As third-party high-level output distortion data is limited, we keep the overall evaluation mid-level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The custom 110mm AMT tweeter employs an air-displacement principle derived from Oskar Heil. The 8-inch woofer uses an approximately 37.8mm voice coil with a large magnetic circuit, and the crossover is set at 2,200Hz. The cabinet employs a multilayer structure and optimized bracing to suppress resonances, and the crossover uses high-quality parts including Mundorf components. The dedicated stand has a 5-degree rear tilt and open frame to reduce energy storage and interference. User-adjustable woofer damping and HF level are provided. Overall, technical execution is strong but not the industry’s absolute state of the art.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Against the Fink Team KIM’s 11,995 USD price (pair), an alternative, the Kali Audio IN-8 V2 (399 USD each; 798 USD per pair), offers equivalent or better measured performance at a much lower price. The IN-8 V2 is a 3-way active speaker with an 8-inch woofer and a coaxial mid/high driver, using DSP to achieve a flat rated response (37Hz–25kHz ±3dB) and low distortion. Calculation (USD): 798 USD ÷ 11,995 USD = 0.0665… → 0.1. Therefore, CP is extremely low for KIM.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Fink Team is a relatively new, small-scale German manufacturer led by the renowned engineer Karl-Heinz Fink. While its products are regarded as high quality, the company's short history means there is insufficient long-term reliability data or a track record of failure rates. Warranty periods and repair systems may be more limited compared to major manufacturers, and there are uncertainties regarding its global support network. While industry-average support can be expected, the lack of an extensive network like that of larger companies is a concern.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The product's basic acoustic design (e.g., using a large woofer and an AMT tweeter) is rational. However, there is no scientific evidence or overwhelming performance advantage in measurements to justify the 11,995 USD price tag. Considering that less expensive active speakers can achieve equivalent or superior performance using technologies like DSP, the performance improvement offered by this product does not seem proportional to its price. This suggests a design philosophy that disregards cost-efficiency, which is questionable from a rational standpoint. Marketing elements unrelated to acoustic performance are also present, and it is highly likely that the cost is excessive relative to any measurable improvement in sound quality.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the Fink Team KIM, a careful comparison with other options is highly recommended. The existence of products like the Kali Audio IN-8 V2, which offers equivalent or better-measured performance at about 1/15th the price, is a critical factor to consider. There is no objective acoustic performance advantage to justify the 11,995 USD investment. Unless you have a strong preference for the Fink Team brand or its specific design, allocating the same budget to a higher-performance active speaker system or a combination of other speakers and a high-performance amplifier would likely result in a superior audio system overall. It is wise to make a decision based on performance comparisons from measured data, rather than on brand image alone.
