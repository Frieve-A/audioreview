summary: "A crystallization of German acoustic engineering as a 2-way floorstanding speaker. While specifications are advanced, considering the current market price (Borg Episode 2 in Japan: 44,000 USD per pair), alternatives offering equivalent or better user-oriented functions and measured performance at lower cost exist; thus, cost-performance is low."

## Overview

Fink Team originates from Fink Audio-Consulting, a European acoustic development company active for over 30 years, and now operates as a German loudspeaker brand. The Borg is a 2-way floorstanding speaker combining a 10.25-inch mid/bass driver with a proprietary AMT tweeter, employing a 1,600Hz crossover. Each 52kg cabinet uses a sandwich-structure MDF design, with four rear adjustment controls for acoustic fine-tuning. In 2024, an improved Borg Episode 2 was announced; the current Japan market price is 44,000 USD per pair (tax-included).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Borg's measurement-oriented specifications are excellent for a 2-way speaker. Frequency response is 41Hz–30kHz (-6dB), 32Hz–35kHz (-10dB). Distortion is mainly 2nd-order, with the official spec stating THD < 0.2% at 87dB SPL. The AMT tweeter's 6,464mm² diaphragm area enables a relatively low 1,600Hz crossover, with good phase alignment via a 4th-order Linkwitz–Riley design. Average impedance is 10Ω and sensitivity is 87dB/2.83V/1m, implying adequate amplifier drive is advisable.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Borg's technical design demonstrates sophisticated engineering approaches based on 30 years of acoustic development experience. The combination of a 10.25-inch driver with an AMT tweeter at 1,600Hz represents a challenging design that pushes the limits of conventional 2-way configurations. The custom-designed mid/bass driver with a 3-inch voice coil achieves both natural tonality and high damping through the combination of paper cone and textile surround. The proprietary modification of the Mundorf AMT tweeter enabling high-quality reproduction at low crossover frequencies demonstrates high technical competence. The comprehensive design level, including sandwich cabinet construction, laser vibration measurement optimization, and four rear adjustment functions for acoustic matching, ranks among the industry's top tier.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

We unify the currency to USD for calculation. Using the current Japan market price for Borg (Episode 2) as a proxy at approximately 44,000 USD per pair, and selecting KEF Reference 3 Meta (USD 14,000 per pair) as the cheapest product with equivalent or better user-oriented functions and measured performance, the calculation is: 14,000 USD ÷ 44,000 USD = 0.33 → 0.3. Given alternatives offering comparable performance at a much lower price, the CP score is low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Fink Team maintains quality control through artisanal manufacturing in Germany and an established sales network in the European market. Technical reliability is highly rated due to over 30 years of acoustic development experience. However, as a relatively new brand, the period of market track record accumulation is limited, and long-term product support and parts supply systems remain unclear compared to more established manufacturers. While warranty periods and after-service systems are at industry-standard levels, considering the global deployment scale, there are differences in support network comprehensiveness compared to major competitors.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Borg combines traditional cabinet/network approaches with modern measurement-led optimization. The 10.25-inch driver with a 1,600Hz AMT crossover, four rear adjustment functions, and sandwich cabinet are practical choices. However, given current market pricing and the presence of cheaper alternatives with comparable measured outcomes, the cost of achieving those results appears only moderately rational.

## Advice

The Fink Team Borg is an engineeringly accomplished speaker, but at the current market price (≈ USD 42,600 per pair) it warrants caution. It suits systems that already have sufficient amplifier drive and users who specifically value the AMT and cabinet execution. For general buyers, prioritize auditioning lower-cost alternatives such as the KEF Reference 3 Meta that offer equivalent user functions and measured performance, and select the minimum-cost model that meets requirements (size, placement, max SPL, etc.).
