## Overview

The iFi Audio Uno is a compact USB-powered desktop DAC and headphone amplifier positioned as an affordable upgrade solution for computer audio setups. Measuring 88 x 81 x 26mm and weighing 92g, this pocket-sized unit features USB-C connectivity and dual outputs including a 3.5mm S-Balanced headphone output and stereo RCA line outputs. The Uno incorporates an ESS ES9219MQ DAC chip with support for high-resolution audio formats up to 32-bit/384kHz PCM and DSD256, along with MQA compatibility. Notable features include three tailored EQ modes (Music, Movie, Game), analog volume control, and PowerMatch gain adjustment. Priced at 79 USD, the Uno represents iFi Audio's entry-level offering targeting users seeking to enhance standard computer audio with both headphone amplification and line output capabilities for powered speakers or external amplifiers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The iFi Audio Uno demonstrates manufacturer performance specifications that indicate potentially solid audio quality performance, though independent third-party verification remains unavailable for comprehensive assessment. Manufacturer specifications report THD+N ≤0.02% for headphone output, which if accurate would position performance between excellent (0.01%) and transparent levels for the headphone amplifier category [1]. Signal-to-noise ratio specifications of ≥113dBA (headphone) and ≥119dBA (line output) would significantly surpass the transparent threshold of 105dB if verified [1]. Dynamic range performance claims of ≥122dB (headphone) and ≥115dB (line output) would substantially exceed transparent-level requirements, while output impedance specification of <1Ω suggests proper headphone driving characteristics [1]. Channel separation at ≥80dB (1kHz/600Ω) would exceed transparent performance criteria if verified [1]. Output power delivery of ≥211mW at 32Ω and 39mW at 300Ω appears adequate for typical headphone applications [1]. However, as these represent manufacturer specifications without independent third-party measurements, conservative evaluation applies with significant score adjustment toward 0.5 as mandated by policy for unverified claims. The absence of frequency response deviation data and independent testing prevents comprehensive evaluation of actual linearity performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The iFi Audio Uno employs contemporary technology appropriate for its price point, centered around the ESS ES9219MQ DAC chip from ESS Technology's Sabre HiFi series. This implementation features 32-bit HyperStream III architecture combined with Quad DAC+ and Time Domain Jitter Eliminator technology, representing current-generation silicon appropriate for the application [2]. The USB interface utilizes Comtrue CT 7601 bridge technology for digital connectivity [2]. iFi's proprietary S-Balanced headphone configuration represents the primary technical differentiation, designed to reduce noise and crosstalk compared to standard single-ended implementations [2]. The analog volume control maintains signal resolution across the adjustment range, while three EQ modes (Music, Movie, Game) provide user-selectable frequency response tailoring with substantial bass emphasis variations [2]. However, the core technology relies on established industry components without significant innovation beyond the S-Balanced implementation. The design represents competent engineering using proven approaches rather than advancing technical boundaries or introducing novel solutions that other manufacturers would seek to adopt.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 79 USD, the iFi Audio Uno bundles USB-C input, S-Balanced headphone amplification, fixed-level RCA line output, three EQ presets, analog volume, and PowerMatch gain switching in one enclosure [3]. No cheaper device can be confirmed to cover that entire user-facing feature set with equal or better measured performance. The only verified equivalent-or-better alternative is the Creative Sound Blaster X5, which adds dual Cirrus Logic CS43198 DACs, RCA line I/O, 4.4 mm and 3.5 mm headphone outputs, Bluetooth receiver, front-panel EQ recall, and 10-band EQ control while publishing THD+N 0.00018% and 130 dB DNR[6]. However, its current US price is 284.99 USD. Because this is the least expensive configuration that meets or exceeds Uno’s functionality, the Uno is effectively the cheapest option available: CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The iFi Audio Uno benefits from simple electronic construction with minimal failure points typical of USB DAC/amplifier devices, contributing to inherent reliability. The unit features solid-state design without moving parts beyond the analog volume control, reducing potential mechanical failure modes [2]. iFi Audio provides standard 1-year warranty coverage for parts and labor, ensuring products remain free from defects in materials and workmanship, though this falls below the industry standard 2-year coverage period [5]. The warranty policy includes repair or replacement at manufacturer discretion during the coverage period, with customers responsible for shipping costs to authorized distributors. Post-warranty repairs incur charges to the owner with 100-day coverage on completed work. The company maintains global support infrastructure through authorized distributors rather than direct manufacturer service channels. Product registration is available through iFi's online system for warranty activation and exclusive benefits access [5]. The simple USB-powered design represents inherently robust construction without complex power supply requirements or thermal management challenges that could affect long-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

iFi Audio's design philosophy for the Uno reveals fundamental contradictions between stated approach and practical implementation. The company explicitly prioritizes "emotion over specifications," advocating evaluation based on subjective listening experience rather than scientific measurement. Their philosophy emphasizes the question "Do you find yourself listening to music longer?" as the ultimate standard, with company representatives stating that the emotional effect of audio devices represents the true measure of quality rather than technical metrics. Company philosophy maintains that "fixating solely on technical metrics is like missing the forest for the trees," representing an anti-scientific approach to audio evaluation. For digital audio products, iFi compares designs to reference vinyl systems with tubes in the signal path, incorporating TubeState circuitry where vacuum tubes are not present. This design reference philosophy fundamentally contradicts scientific measurement-based evaluation principles by using inherently inferior analog reference systems as design targets. However, the actual Uno implementation achieves objectively good measured performance specifications across key indicators, suggesting competent engineering execution despite philosophical opposition to measurement-focused design. The contradiction between stated philosophy rejecting scientific measurement while producing technically competent products represents irrational design philosophy that undermines confidence in the company's systematic approach to audio improvement.

## Advice

For prospective purchasers seeking an affordable USB DAC and headphone amplifier with line output capability, the iFi Audio Uno represents a competent choice at 79 USD. The unit's primary strengths include solid measured performance specifications, unique S-Balanced headphone implementation, dual output functionality with both headphone and line connections, and three EQ modes providing frequency response customization for different content types. Users requiring both headphone amplification and line output for powered speakers or external amplifiers will appreciate the dual functionality not commonly available in competing products at this price point. The PowerMatch gain adjustment and analog volume control provide useful operational flexibility. However, limitations include reliance on manufacturer specifications without independent verification, standard 1-year warranty coverage, and company philosophy that explicitly rejects scientific measurement approaches. Users prioritizing proven third-party measured performance should consider alternatives like the DUNU DTC-480 or FiiO KA11, which offer superior verified specifications but lack line output capability. The Uno serves users seeking specific feature combinations including EQ modes and line outputs who can accept manufacturer performance claims pending independent verification.
