## Overview

The iFi Audio Zen One Signature is a versatile DAC featuring USB, Bluetooth 5.1, optical digital, and coaxial digital inputs. It adopts a "True Native" design using Burr-Brown DAC chips and supports PCM 32bit/384kHz, DSD256, and MQA decoding. A 16-core XMOS processor enables high-precision digital processing, while 4.4mm balanced and RCA unbalanced outputs provide flexible connectivity. Bluetooth connectivity supports multiple codecs, enabling connections from smartphones to high-quality audio systems. At a price of 349 USD, the design emphasizes versatile connectivity and practicality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Measurement performance records SNR -105dB(A) and THD+N <0.002%. The SNR achieves the transparency level of 105dB, and THD+N is below the transparency level of 0.01%. Frequency response covers a wide bandwidth of 5Hz-80kHz ±3dB. Output voltage of 4V/2V (balanced/unbalanced) provides sufficient driving power. Based on measurement data, transparency within audible thresholds is achievable, but it does not reach the highest level of measurement performance, remaining at an excellent level for scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Burr-Brown DAC chip "True Native" design aims to optimize signal paths but is not industry-leading technology. The 16-core XMOS processor offers standard performance, and Bluetooth 5.1 support represents current generation technology standards. MQA decoding functionality is included but is primarily software-based implementation. Overall, the design combines existing technologies with limited uniqueness or technological innovation. While maintaining stable technical standards as a product, no industry-leading technological advantages are evident.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Against the 349 USD price, the xDuoo XD-05 Basic with equivalent or superior functionality and measurement performance is available for 155 USD. The xDuoo XD-05 Basic features Bluetooth 5.0 support, ES9018K2M DAC, excellent measurement values of SNR 112dB and THD 0.0025%, 4.4mm balanced output, 6.35mm single-ended output, LDAC support, and USB/optical/coaxial inputs. Cost-performance calculation yields 155 USD ÷ 349 USD = 0.444, rounded to 0.4. Since equivalent Bluetooth functionality and measurement performance can be achieved at nearly half the price, cost-performance is inferior.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

iFi Audio is an established audio brand headquartered in the UK with a certain market track record. Product warranty provides industry-standard periods, and support systems are well-established. No significant quality issues or high failure rates have been reported to date. However, compared to Asian emerging manufacturers, it does not provide particularly superior warranty periods or support services, being evaluated as industry-average reliability and support systems. Long-term durability is also at a reasonable level for general audio equipment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy emphasizing diverse connectivity is practical and rational. The integration of Bluetooth to address modern usage environments is particularly commendable. However, focus on MQA decoding functionality has limited scientific basis and appears to have strong marketing aspects. The "True Native" expression also gives a marketing-heavy impression beyond technical reality. Overall, while taking a rational approach emphasizing practicality and convenience, some functions and expressions with thin scientific basis are included, making the design philosophy not entirely rational.

## Advice

The Zen One Signature is suitable for those seeking diverse connectivity in a DAC, but has cost-performance issues. For the same Bluetooth DAC functionality, the xDuoo XD-05 Basic provides equivalent or superior measurement performance and features for 155 USD, making it difficult to find rational reasons to choose the 349 USD Zen One Signature. The xDuoo XD-05 Basic demonstrates measurement performance with SNR 112dB and THD 0.0025% close to the Zen One Signature, while fully equipped with Bluetooth support, balanced output, and USB/optical/coaxial inputs. Even for those who frequently listen to MQA sources, other alternatives are more rational considering the price difference. Unless there is strong commitment to the iFi Audio brand, purchase cannot be recommended. When considering Bluetooth DAC purchases, first examine the xDuoo XD-05 Basic as the primary candidate and carefully evaluate whether higher-priced products offer clear added value.
