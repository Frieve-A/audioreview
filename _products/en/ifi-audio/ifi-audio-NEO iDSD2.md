## Overview

The iFi-audio NEO iDSD2 is a desktop DAC/amp that claims to be the world's first to support aptX Lossless. It delivers excellent measured performance with SNR >120dB and THD+N <0.0015%, providing up to 5,551mW of powerful output. With Bluetooth 5.4 and aptX Lossless compatibility, it enables wireless playback of lossless audio sources. The unit features quad-channel Burr Brown DACs and PureWave circuit design in a balanced dual-mono configuration. Priced at 899 USD, it positions itself in the mid-to-high tier of the desktop audio market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measured performance nearly achieves transparency levels. SNR >120dB (transparency level 105dB+), THD+N <0.0015% (transparency level 0.01% or below), and Dynamic Range 120dB (transparency level 105dB+) all clear the transparency benchmarks in the measurement criteria table. While official frequency response information is limited, reviews indicate slight warmth in the low-midrange with good clarity across the full frequency spectrum. These measurement results reach levels that provide meaningful audio quality improvements for human hearing.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The proprietary PureWave circuit design and balanced dual-mono configuration demonstrate technical excellence, with GMT femto-precision clock jitter reduction technology achieving over 20dB improvement. Being the world's first aptX Lossless compatible Bluetooth DAC/amp shows technical advancement, though the basic DAC/amp circuitry remains within industry-standard design approaches. The quad-channel Burr Brown DAC configuration is a rational choice but offers limited innovation. While above industry average in technical level, it falls short of the highest standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

As a product with equivalent or superior functionality and measured performance, the FiiO K7 BT (approx. 250 USD) exists. The K7 BT delivers superior measured performance with THD+N <0.0003% and SNR ≥128dB, includes Bluetooth (LDAC support), and provides a sufficient 2000mW (at 32Ω) of output power. Cost-performance calculation: 250 USD ÷ 899 USD = 0.278, rounded to 0.3. While the NEO iDSD2's aptX Lossless support and powerful 5,551mW output are differentiating factors, the K7 BT offers superior core measured performance and sufficient functionality at about a third of the price, leading to a low cost-performance rating.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

iFi-audio is an established UK-based audio brand with a solid industry reputation. Product warranty coverage is standard, with firmware update support provided. Historical failure rates for past products remain at industry average, with support systems functioning appropriately. Despite the complex configuration for desktop audio equipment, design maturity is sufficient, allowing reliability for long-term use to be rated above industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design approach emphasizing measured performance improvement is rational and contributes to transparency level achievement. Adoption of latest technologies like aptX Lossless support and Bluetooth 5.4 is commendable. However, some audio equipment-specific subjective expressions (such as "warm sound character") are observed, indicating it's not entirely based on scientific evidence. While the existence rationale as a desktop DAC/amp is clear, considering that comparable or superior performance can be achieved for far less money by other products, the rationality of its price point is low.

## Advice

The NEO iDSD2 is a desktop DAC/amp with excellent measured performance and powerful output, but careful consideration is needed regarding whether it provides value commensurate with its 899 USD price point. As an alternative, the FiiO K7 BT (approx. 250 USD) surpasses the NEO iDSD2 in measured performance (THD+N <0.0003% vs <0.0015%, SNR ≥128dB vs >120dB) and includes LDAC Bluetooth and a sufficient 2000mW of headphone output. The advantages of the NEO iDSD2 are its cutting-edge aptX Lossless compatibility, its significantly higher 5,551mW power output, and its dedicated desktop form factor. However, no significant, objectively measurable advantage has been confirmed between aptX Lossless and existing codecs like LDAC. Potential buyers should carefully evaluate whether the high power, aptX Lossless support, and design justify the approximate 650 USD price premium before purchase.
