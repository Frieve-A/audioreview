## Overview

The iFi audio ZEN DAC 3 is a desktop DAC/headphone amplifier developed by UK-based iFi audio, currently priced at 34,794 yen. It features an upgraded USB-C input from the previous generation, incorporates a 16-core XMOS processor with Burr-Brown DAC chip, and supports DSD512/PCM768kHz/MQA full decoding. Equipped with 4.4mm balanced and RCA outputs, it achieves high measured performance with THD+N 0.0015% (balanced) and SNR 113dB. The XBass+ feature is also included, designed as the core of a compact desktop audio system.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The ZEN DAC 3's measured performance demonstrates excellent specifications with THD+N 0.0015% (balanced output), SNR 113dB, and dynamic range 113dB, which are significantly below audible thresholds. These figures substantially exceed human auditory limits (THD approximately 0.1%, SNR approximately 90dB), theoretically enabling completely transparent audio reproduction. In ABX testing, distinguishing this unit from other high-performance DACs would be extremely difficult with high-quality recordings. Compared to the similarly-priced FiiO K7, the ZEN DAC 3 demonstrates clear superiority in measured performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The adoption of a 16-core XMOS processor (2000MIPS, 512KB) represents a significant improvement in processing capability over the previous generation, supporting the highest levels of digital audio formats including DSD512/PCM768kHz. The circuit design combining the Burr-Brown DAC chip demonstrates extremely high standards as evidenced by the measured results. Full balanced circuit design, low output impedance (below 1ฮฉ), and comprehensive output options (4.4mm balanced, RCA, 6.3mm headphone) represent the highest technical standards in this price range. MQA full decoding support also demonstrates technological advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

No other products achieve THD+N 0.0015% at the 34,794 yen price point. The direct competitor FiiO K7 (30,580 yen) achieves approximately 0.005% THD+N, clearly placing the ZEN DAC 3 in a superior position regarding measured performance. CP = 30,580 yen รท 34,794 yen = 0.88, providing improved measured performance for a 4,214 yen price difference. For higher performance levels, products costing over 100,000 yen are typically required, demonstrating extremely excellent cost-performance in this price category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

iFi audio, as an established UK audio manufacturer, has a strong reputation for product reliability and support structure. The ZEN DAC series has undergone continuous improvements since the original 2019 release, suggesting expectation for long-term product development and support. User reviews report few failure incidents, with high satisfaction ratings of 4.33/5 on price comparison sites. Domestic authorized dealer warranty and support are well-established, providing the highest level of reliability in this price range.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The ZEN DAC 3 design rationally pursues the balance between improved measured performance and practical utility. The transition to USB-C input, adoption of 16-core processor, and full balanced circuitry all directly contribute to sound quality improvement through rational design choices. DSP processing features like XBass+ are left to user discretion, achieving balance between purist audio pursuit and practical utility. The compact desktop design suits modern usage environments, representing an extremely rational product from both technical and practical perspectives.

## Advice

The iFi audio ZEN DAC 3 is strongly recommended for those seeking high-performance desktop DACs at the 34,794 yen price point. It's particularly optimal for headphone-focused use where balanced connection high-quality audio is prioritized. When comparing with the competing FiiO K7, despite being approximately 4,000 yen more expensive, the clear improvement in measured performance justifies the price difference. However, if multiple inputs are required or higher output power is needed, the K7 might be more suitable. If budget permits, considering this as a long-term investment, the ZEN DAC 3 will likely provide higher satisfaction. For those prioritizing DSD support or MQA playback, the ZEN DAC 3 offers clear advantages.
