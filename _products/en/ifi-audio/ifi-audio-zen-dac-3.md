## Overview

The iFi Audio ZEN DAC 3 is a desktop digital-to-analog converter and headphone amplifier designed to deliver high-resolution audio performance in a compact form factor. Building on the success of previous ZEN DAC models, this third-generation device incorporates a 16-core XMOS processor and four-channel Burr-Brown DAC chip to support extensive format compatibility including 768kHz PCM, DSD512, and full MQA decoding. The unit features both balanced 4.4mm and single-ended 6.3mm headphone outputs alongside RCA line outputs, targeting audiophiles seeking comprehensive connectivity and high-resolution format support. Established in 2012 as a subsidiary of AMR, iFi Audio has built a reputation for bringing high-end audio technology to more accessible price points.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

SNR ≥113dB exceeds 105dB transparent threshold. THD+N <0.0015% balanced, <0.003% RCA below 0.01% criterion. Output power >390mW @ 64Ω, >210mW @ 32Ω adequate for most headphones. Frequency response 5Hz-90kHz ±3dB approaches problematic deviation. Supports 768kHz PCM, DSD512. Conservative scoring due to lack of third-party measurements [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

16-core XMOS processor enables full MQA decoding, DSD512 support. Burr-Brown four-channel DAC uses True Native architecture for separate PCM/DSD processing. Proprietary Active Noise Cancellation II power supply, symmetrical analog stage with precision components. Represents established rather than cutting-edge methodology [1][3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

At 199 USD, FiiO K11 (129 USD) provides equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance. Equipped with balanced 4.4mm output, single-ended 6.35mm output, and RCA line outputs, with superior measured performance: THD+N <0.00035% vs <0.0015%, SNR 123dB vs ≥113dB, output power 1400mW @ 32Ω vs >210mW @ 32Ω. Supports 384kHz/32-bit PCM and DSD256, lacking MQA support but providing core DAC/amplifier functions and balanced output. CP = 129 ÷ 199 = 0.648 → 0.6 [2][5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

1-year warranty below industry standard. Dealer-based support with inconsistent repair response. Documented customer complaints regarding warranty policies and hardware defects. Reported audio dropout issues and quality control problems with connectors acknowledged by manufacturer [4].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Emphasis on "minimizing distortion and maximizing transparency" aligns with measurement-focused development. 16-core XMOS processing enables measurable functionality improvements. USB-C connectivity, balanced outputs address practical requirements. Represents established discrete DAC/amplifier approach rather than innovative methodology [1][3].

## Advice

Moderate value considering available alternatives. Recommended specifically for users requiring MQA decoding, as this feature differentiates it from cheaper options like FiiO K11. Suits balanced headphones and high-resolution format enthusiasts. Consider limited 1-year warranty and reported support issues. Users not requiring MQA can achieve equivalent-or-better core DAC/amplifier performance with balanced output at substantially lower cost with alternatives like FiiO K11.
