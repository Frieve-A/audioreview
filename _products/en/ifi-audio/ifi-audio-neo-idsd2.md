## Overview

The iFi Audio Neo iDSD2 is a desktop DAC/headphone amplifier developed by UK-based iFi Audio. It achieves a world-first with aptX Lossless support, featuring a 4-channel Burr-Brown DAC setup supporting up to 768kHz PCM and DSD512, and delivering an impressive 5,551mW of output power at a 32Ω load. This represents a significant performance improvement over the original Neo iDSD, positioning it as a versatile product that enables high-quality playback through both Bluetooth 5.4 and wired connections. The product embodies iFi Audio's accumulated technical expertise and the reliability of an established British audio manufacturer.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measurement performance achieves exceptionally high standards. The nominal specifications, including an S/N ratio over 120dB, a dynamic range of 120dB, and THD+N below 0.0015%, all comfortably clear the 'transparent' levels in the measurement criteria table. This indicates that there is virtually no audible degradation in the audible range. The true native decoding through the 4-channel Burr-Brown DACs and the low-noise, low-distortion implementation via the PureWave circuit design are scientifically effective. The 1,200kbps bitrate of aptX Lossless enables lossless transmission of CD-quality audio, ensuring high transparency even over a Bluetooth connection. The device is confirmed to provide audibly meaningful sound quality improvements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 4-channel Burr-Brown DAC setup in a balanced configuration and the world-first aptX Lossless support demonstrate a high level of technical advancement. The achievement of 5,551mW of high output power and the 4-stage gain settings from -12dB to +16dB, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of headphones, are technically excellent. The PureWave circuit design with its short signal paths and noise reduction, plus analog processing technologies like XSpace and XBass II, show unique approaches. However, the proprietary design details of the DAC chips and amplifier circuits are not fully disclosed, falling short of being considered industry-leading. While MQA and DSD512 support demonstrate technical completeness, these represent combinations of existing technologies rather than groundbreaking innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This product is the only integrated DAC/headphone amplifier on the market that offers both an output exceeding 5,500mW at 32Ω and support for aptX Lossless, which enables CD-quality lossless transmission. While other products may offer similar output power, they typically lack Bluetooth functionality or require a more expensive separate component setup. Therefore, for this unique combination of features and performance, the Neo iDSD2 is effectively the most cost-effective option available. As there are no cheaper alternatives with equivalent capabilities, the score is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

iFi Audio has an established position as a reliable British audio manufacturer. Operating under the Abbingdon Music Research (AMR) umbrella with over 50 products, they maintain consistent quality control and technical development. A one-year product warranty and a globally deployed repair infrastructure provide appropriate post-purchase support. However, repair support in some regions may go through import distributors, creating time constraints typical of overseas manufacturers. While no significant failure rate issues have been reported for their products, the responsiveness of the repair system may be inferior compared to some other manufacturers. Overall, they provide reliability above the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design approach of aiming for the 'transparent' level achievement from the measurement criteria table is extremely rational. Scientific evidence-based sound quality improvement approaches are adopted, including a 4-channel DAC configuration for a balanced design, noise minimization through short signal paths, and ensuring sufficient output power. The inclusion of aptX Lossless support also represents a rational technical choice to scientifically address the sound quality constraints of Bluetooth connections. Analog processing like XSpace and XBass II provides a rational implementation that enables sound field adjustment while avoiding the signal degradation of DSP. The design philosophy of balancing high output and Bluetooth capability in a dedicated desktop audio device is also reasonable, addressing what general-purpose devices struggle to achieve. Non-scientific claims and occult elements are eliminated, with development purely pursuing improvements in measurement performance.

## Advice

Prospective buyers should carefully consider whether they truly need the standout feature of this product: its immense output power of over 5,500mW. For users of demanding planar magnetic or high-impedance headphones, this power provides significant value. Furthermore, for those who seek the highest possible audio quality in a wireless setup, the world-first aptX Lossless support offers a unique advantage. However, for users with more common headphones that do not require such high power, this device may be overkill. It is important to evaluate your own headphones and listening habits to determine if the unique value proposition of the Neo iDSD2 justifies its price.
