## Overview

The iFi Audio xDSD Gryphon is a premium portable DAC/headphone amplifier using a Burr-Brown DAC, supporting PCM up to 32-bit/768 kHz, DSD512, and full MQA decoding. It includes Bluetooth 5.1 with aptX Adaptive/HD/LL, LDAC, and LHDC/HWA; USB-C and S/PDIF inputs; 4.4 mm balanced and 3.5 mm S-Balanced outputs; plus analog features like XBass II, XSpace, and iEMatch. Rated balanced power is >1000 mW at 32 Ω with <1 Ω output impedance. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specs indicate transparent-level performance: SNR up to 116 dB(A) (balanced), THD+N <0.005% (1 V @16 Ω), and output >1000 mW @32 Ω (balanced), all surpassing audibility thresholds for electronics. [1] Independent lab measurements (L7Audiolab) show THD behavior consistent with the published spec—e.g., around 0.007% (balanced) and 0.015% (single-ended) at 0 dBFS—and document the operation of XBass II/XSpace and IEM-optimized modes. [2] Collectively, the Gryphon achieves transparent reproduction with ample headroom.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Gryphon integrates high-rate USB audio, a wide-codec Bluetooth receiver (aptX Adaptive/HD/LL, LDAC, LHDC/HWA), balanced 4.4 mm I/O, and analog enhancement options (XBass II, XSpace) in a compact, battery-powered device. Its feature depth and flexible I/O are strong for a portable unit, though not category-redefining. [1][7]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Comparator (equal-or-better from a user perspective): TOPPING G5.** It offers **Bluetooth with LDAC**, **balanced 4.4 mm output**, **very low measured distortion/noise**, and **higher rated power (≈1.2 W @32 Ω)**—meeting or exceeding Gryphon’s core functions and measured performance relevant to listeners. [3][4]

CP is computed against the **cheapest current market price** for an equivalent-or-better product: we confirm a representative market (non-coupon) list of **299 USD** for G5 (regular price). [4]  
**CP = 299 USD ÷ 599 USD = 0.499 → 0.5.**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

iFi provides a **1-year** manufacturer warranty and a central **Download Hub** for drivers/firmware, which has included updates for the Gryphon line. This is industry-standard coverage with ongoing software support; long-term failure statistics remain limited. [5][6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design focuses on transparent electrical performance with user-switchable, **pure-analog** enhancements (XBass II/XSpace) and iEMatch to mitigate hiss with sensitive IEMs—measurably addressing real usage problems without relying on unverifiable claims. [2][7]

## Advice

Buy the xDSD Gryphon if you specifically want its UI/ergonomics and analog options (XBass II/XSpace/iEMatch) in one unit and value its industrial design. From a purely performance/feature standpoint, the **TOPPING G5** delivers equal-or-better measurable results, similar connectivity (including LDAC Bluetooth), and more output power at **roughly half the price**, so it is the rational default for most users. [3][4]
