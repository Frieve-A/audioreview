## Overview

The iFi Audio GO Link Max is a USB-C dongle DAC using dual ESS ES9219 chips with **both** 3.5 mm (S-Balanced) and 4.4 mm balanced outputs in a 14.5 g body (150×15×10 mm). Rated output is up to **241 mW @ 32 Ω (bal.)** / **100 mW @ 32 Ω (SE)**, SNR **130 dBA (bal.) / 125 dBA (SE)**, and THD+N ≤0.0016% (bal.) / ≤0.0015% (SE). It supports PCM up to 384 kHz and DSD256. Channel separation exceeds **118 dB**. Manufacturer materials note Dynamic Range Enhancement (DRE) adding **+6 dB** to dynamic range [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specifications fall within or above common transparency thresholds for portable DACs: THD+N ≤0.0016% (32 Ω, bal.) and ≤0.0015% (SE), SNR 130/125 dBA, wide FR (10 Hz–80 kHz, –3 dB), and channel separation >118 dB. Power of **241 mW @ 32 Ω (bal.)** is ample for most headphones/IEMs. Independent lab measurements were not located at the time of writing; figures are therefore **catalog specs** pending third-party data [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A competent but conventional dual-DAC per-channel implementation with balanced output on a compact dongle. Notable additions include hardware volume and **DRE (+6 dB)** as claimed by the maker. These are sensible engineering choices, albeit not cutting-edge compared to the most advanced dongles today [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better):** **TempoTec Sonata BHD Pro** — dual CS43131, **3.5 mm + 4.4 mm**, **280 mW @ 32 Ω (bal.)**, **SNR 131 dB**, **THD+N 0.00012%**, at **USD 69.90** [3].  
**Equivalence note:** Provides the same user-visible I/O (3.5/4.4) and **measured performance that is equal-or-better** in core axes (power ≥241 mW, SNR ≥130 dB, lower THD+N) [1][3].  
**CP calculation:** **69.90 ÷ 79 = 0.885 → 0.9**.  
(Reference alternative: **FiiO KA13**, 3.5/4.4 and **550 mW @ 32 Ω (bal.)** typically **USD 65.99–79.99**, but SNR spec is lower at 122 dB; still well within transparent range) [4][5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Warranty:** 1-year parts/labor; **registration within 30 days** required; coverage limited to the **country of original sale** and **non-transferable** [7].  
**User feedback:** **Trustpilot 4.4/5 (202 reviews)** as of 2025-08-24 [6]. No systemic failure data identified; treat as average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Focus on measurable performance (balanced topology, low THD+N, high SNR) and practical I/O is rational. Pricing remains competitive given current market baselines once benchmarked against the true **cheapest** equal-or-better rivals.

## Advice

If you want a pocketable, plug-and-play dongle with **both** 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm and enough power for many full-size dynamics/planars, the GO Link Max is a safe pick at USD 79. If your priority is **maximum value or power**, consider **TempoTec Sonata BHD Pro** (cheapest equal-or-better) [3] or **FiiO KA13** for sheer output [4][5]. Choose based on your load (impedance/sensitivity) and connector needs.
