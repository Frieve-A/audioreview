## Overview

The Hip DAC 3 adds iEMatch for sensitive IEMs and dual USB-C ports to iFi’s flask-shaped portable DAC/amp. US street price is 199 USD (e.g., Bloom Audio) with support up to PCM 384kHz/DSD256 and both 3.5mm SE and 4.4mm balanced outputs [1][3]. The battery is 2,200mAh; manufacturer materials list approx. 8 hours (media deck) and “up to 12 hours” on the product page [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

From official specs: SNR <109dB(A) balanced / <103dB(A) SE; THD+N <0.006% (balanced, 360mW/2V@600Ω) and <0.01% (SE, 100mW/1.27V@16Ω); frequency response 20Hz–45kHz (-3dB); output 400mW@32Ω (balanced), 280mW@32Ω (SE); output impedance ≤1Ω (≤4.5Ω with iEMatch)[2]. These are competent but not class-leading figures, and independent third-party measurements are limited. Score reflects a conservative, spec-based assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

True-balanced topology, S-Balanced SE, revised GMT with a new crystal oscillator, and iEMatch are all sensible engineering moves[1][2]. However, the architecture and measured targets remain conventional rather than state of the art.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **FiiO KA13** (dongle). It delivers up to **550mW@32Ω balanced** (desktop mode) with strong SNR/THD+N and costs **79.99 USD**[4][5]. Calculation: **79.99 USD ÷ 199 USD = 0.402** → **0.4**. Therefore, you can obtain equal-or-better output performance at ~40% of the Hip DAC 3’s price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Solid build, clear documentation, and a **12-month** limited warranty are stated in official materials[2]. iFi’s support presence is established, though long-term failure data specific to Hip DAC 3 is not yet abundant.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Prioritizing noise control (iEMatch, oscillator/GMT updates) is rational, but retaining the flask form and analog XBass instead of relying solely on software EQ suggests some emphasis on brand ergonomics over pure measurement optimization[1][2].

## Advice

Choose Hip DAC 3 if you want a **battery-powered** wired DAC/amp with iEMatch for hiss-free IEM use. If you **don’t need a battery**, the **FiiO KA13**/KA17 dongles offer higher power for less (KA13 **79.99 USD**, KA17 **149.99 USD**, up to **650mW@32Ω balanced**)[4][5][9][10]. If you need **Bluetooth and app PEQ**, **Qudelix 5K** remains excellent (4V balanced, deep PEQ, ~109.98 USD)[6][7]. For Bluetooth with high power in one box, consider **FiiO BTR17** (up to **650mW@32Ω balanced**)[8].
