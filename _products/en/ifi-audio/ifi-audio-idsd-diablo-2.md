## Overview

The iFi audio iDSD Diablo 2 is a transportable DAC/headphone amplifier delivering up to 5,180mW balanced output power. Measuring 166×85×28.5mm and weighing 455g, it features dual Burr-Brown DAC chips in interleaved configuration, supports PCM up to 32-bit/768kHz and DSD512, and includes Bluetooth 5.4 with aptX Lossless. The device offers three power modes for different headphone types and includes innovative xMEMS microspeaker technology support, positioning it as a premium solution bridging portable and desktop audio applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent measurements confirm competent, **transparency-borderline** performance rather than the inflated marketing numbers. GoldenSound measured **Dynamic Range (AES17) 104.9dB** and **SNR 105.8dB**, with **gain 0/8.5/17dB** and **output impedance 0.35Ω (standard) / 5.75Ω (IEMatch)**. IEMatch improves **THD+N at IEM levels by ≈7dB** while raising output impedance. Headphones.com reported **SNR ≈110dB** and **Dynamic Range ≈108dB**, broadly consistent. These sit at the usual transparency threshold (≈105–110dB SNR/DR). Also note intersample overs are **not** accommodated; **–3dB digital headroom** is advisable to avoid clipping on some content. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Diablo 2 employs advanced proprietary technologies including the Burr-Brown True Native chipset in a custom interleaved dual-DAC configuration and PureWave fully balanced dual-mono circuitry. DirectDrive eliminates coupling capacitors for a cleaner signal path. The device **supports** xMEMS microspeaker technology; earlier, the **iDSD Diablo-X** was the **first** DAC/amp on the market to offer xMEMS mode. Bluetooth 5.4 uses Qualcomm QCC518x with **aptX Lossless**, and the chassis integrates **customisable wings with 22 cooling rails** to enhance thermals and positioning flexibility. Overall, this is evolutionary refinement rather than a step-change in measured performance. [3][4][5]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For **1,299 USD**, the Diablo 2 faces strong pressure from portable/transportable DAC/amps that are **not inferior in core functions and measured transparency** and that **meet or exceed sustained output power under standard RMS definitions**. Under industry-standard testing, Diablo 2 sustains **≈1.6W RMS** into 32Ω (balanced), while the **FiiO Q7** delivers **≈1.5W (portable mode)** and up to **≈3.0W (desktop/DC mode)** with Bluetooth (LDAC/aptX Adaptive), balanced 4.4mm, and high-spec decoding—at **~600 USD**. Given the large price gap against a non-inferior alternative with equal/greater sustained output capability (in DC mode) and similar feature breadth, the CP score is **0.5**. Diablo 2 keeps advantages such as **aptX Lossless** and **xMEMS mode**, but these niche additions do not offset the value delta for most use cases. [1][3][6][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

iFi provides a **1-year** parts-and-labour warranty, below the common **2-year** baseline in this category. Independent testing documented **current limiting/protective shutdown** under heavy load—e.g., attempting **5W** continuous into 32Ω causes shutdown; the realistic sustained output is **≈1.6W RMS** (balanced) and **≈2.3W RMS** (SE). This does not affect typical listening but undermines marketing clarity and may frustrate users expecting higher sustained power. [1][2][3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design shows forward-looking feature adoption (xMEMS mode, aptX Lossless) on mature analog topologies (PureWave, DirectDrive). Thermals with 22 rails and configurable wings are thoughtful. However, measured performance remains similar to the original Diablo; premium materials and special features elevate price more than core transparency metrics. The philosophy is coherent but value-efficiency is compromised.

## Advice

Choose Diablo 2 if you specifically need **aptX Lossless**, **xMEMS mode**, or prefer its industrial design and accessory set. For most portable DAC/amp needs where **≈1.5–2W RMS sustained output**, **Bluetooth**, and **transparent measurements** suffice, options like **FiiO Q7** deliver substantially better value while matching or exceeding sustained power when DC mode is available.
