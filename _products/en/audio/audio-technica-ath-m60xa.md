summary: "The ATH-M60xA features a 38Ω low-impedance design for portable device compatibility, but faces significant challenges in scientific validity and technological innovation. The 239 USD price point is substantially overpriced compared to other products with equivalent functionality and performance, with notable irrational aspects in design philosophy."

## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-M60xA is an on-ear professional monitor headphone that uses the same 45mm large-aperture driver as the company's popular ATH-M50x. With a frequency response of 15Hz-28kHz and 38Ω low-impedance design, it prioritizes drivability from portable devices. The lightweight 218g body comes with three interchangeable cables, catering to a wide range of applications from studio work to mobile use. Audio-Technica, established in 1962, is a long-established audio equipment manufacturer with a rich history, and the M-series in particular has become an industry standard widely used across the professional audio field.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Measurement data reveals significant dips around 700Hz and 3kHz, which may affect the tonality of vocals and string instruments. However, channel balance is good, with no reported left-right imbalance issues like those found in the ATH-M50x. Total harmonic distortion (THD) is dominated by second harmonics with fewer odd-order peaks, which is within acceptable range for this price category. The 38Ω impedance design achieves 102dB sensitivity, providing sufficient sound pressure levels from portable devices. However, the frequency response irregularities significantly deviate from the transparent level (±0.5dB), indicating substantial room for improvement in scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While adopting the same 45mm large-aperture driver as the ATH-M50x, this is essentially an application of existing technology. The combination of neodymium magnets and copper-clad aluminum wire voice coils represents industry-standard design with no particularly innovative elements. The design change to on-ear configuration contributes to weight reduction, but the technical difficulty is not high. The 38Ω impedance design does consider use with portable devices, but this is also a common design approach. While meeting industry average technical standards, distinctive or advanced features are limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Against the 239 USD price point, the Sony MDR-7506 with equivalent or superior functionality and performance is available for approximately 100 USD. The MDR-7506 features 16Hz-22kHz frequency response, 70Ω impedance, and 120dB sensitivity, with a long-standing track record as an industry standard for studio monitoring applications. CP calculation: 100 USD ÷ 239 USD = 0.42, rounded to 0.4. The ATH-M60xA's price is more than double that of products with equivalent functionality, resulting in poor cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Audio-Technica has a solid track record as an established manufacturer, and the M-series generally demonstrates good durability. Three interchangeable cables (1.2m straight, 3m straight, 3m coiled) are included, showing consideration for failure response. The warranty period is standard and repair infrastructure is established, but does not reach industry-leading levels. Firmware updates are not applicable for passive physical headphones, but long-term parts replacement support is provided. However, no particularly outstanding reliability measures or innovative support systems are evident, placing it slightly below industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The weight reduction achieved through the on-ear design change is commendable, but the frequency response issues should have been addressable at the design stage. The low-impedance design for portable device compatibility is rational, but this has resulted in compromises in sound quality. More critically, the pricing strategy is questionable from a consumer benefit perspective, given that multiple products achieve equivalent functionality at lower prices. There is no clear improvement plan toward achieving the transparent level, and some performance aspects have actually regressed compared to the existing M50x. The necessity of existing as dedicated equipment is also limited due to unclear differentiation factors from general-purpose devices, leading to low rationality in design philosophy.

## Advice

If considering purchase, we recommend careful comparison with the Sony MDR-7506 or Audio-Technica ATH-M50x first. For studio monitoring applications specifically, the MDR-7506 offers advantages in both price and performance with its more neutral frequency response. Even for those committed to the Audio-Technica brand, the ATH-M50x provides superior sound quality evaluation and expected comfort from its over-ear design. Rational reasons for choosing the ATH-M60xA are limited to cases where lightweight design is the top priority and there is a strong preference for the Audio-Technica brand. For general music production or listening purposes, numerous higher-performance options exist in the same price range, so we recommend careful consideration of comprehensive decision factors.
