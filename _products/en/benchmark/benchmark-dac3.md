## Overview

The Benchmark DAC3 is a professional-grade DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) developed by Benchmark Media Systems. Featuring the ESS Technology ES9028PRO chip, it achieves extremely high measurement performance. The company applies studio equipment development expertise to consumer audio, and the DAC3 is designed based on a scientific approach.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The DAC3 demonstrates world-class measured performance. It achieves THD+N of 0.00022% (-113 dBFS), S/N ratio of 128 dB (A‑weighted), frequency response of 20 Hz–20 kHz +0 dB/−0.015 dB, crosstalk of −130 dB at 1 kHz (−116 dB at 20 kHz), and jitter‑induced sidebands below −144 dB. These values significantly exceed transparent levels (S/N ratio above 105 dB, frequency response within ±0.5 dB), making distortion and noise virtually imperceptible within the human audible range [1][2]. The ESS ES9028PRO’s distortion correction and 4‑channel synthesis deliver a 6 dB S/N improvement.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Beyond adopting the flagship ESS ES9028PRO chip, numerous proprietary Benchmark technologies are incorporated. The UltraLock3™ jitter elimination system, HGC (Hybrid Gain Control) system, and volume control technology combining digital-analog passive attenuation represent industry-leading innovations. The 32-bit internal processing ensures 3.5dB headroom above 0dBFS, and the unique 4:1 synthesis architecture demonstrates technological advantages not found in other manufacturers' products.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The price is 2,195 USD. As the cheapest alternative with equal or better user‑facing functions and transparent‑level measurements, we compare RME ADI‑2 Pro FS R BE (1,999 USD), which provides balanced XLR outputs, a high‑performance headphone amp, and analog inputs [3][4]. CP = 1,999 USD ÷ 2,195 USD = 0.91 → 0.9 (rounded).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Benchmark Media Systems has a solid track record as a professional audio equipment manufacturer established in 1983, with extensive adoption in broadcasting stations and recording studios. Product warranty and support systems meet industry standards, with service facilities established in North America. However, domestic support systems in regions outside North America may be more limited compared to major international manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company consistently adopts a scientific approach based on measurement data, eliminating subjective sound quality arguments for rational product development. Achieving measurement values that significantly exceed transparent levels, investing in proprietary technologies for jitter elimination and gain control, and applying measurement/verification methodologies from professional audio to consumer equipment all represent meaningful technological investments based on auditory science. The fact-based product explanations rather than marketing-focused approaches are also commendable.

## Advice

The DAC3 is suitable for users seeking world-class measurement performance, but those prioritizing cost-performance should consider alternative options. Since equivalent transparent-level performance is available at lower prices, the decision hinges on whether you value added benefits beyond measurement data (brand, support, appearance, etc.). It remains an excellent choice for professional environments or when budget allows and maximum measurement performance is desired.
