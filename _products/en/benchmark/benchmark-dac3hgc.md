## Overview

The Benchmark DAC3 HGC is a professional-grade DAC/headphone amplifier/preamp combo developed by Benchmark Media Systems, an American company established in 1978. Utilizing the ESS Technologies ES9028PRO DAC chip with proprietary 4:1 summing technology, it achieves industry-leading measured performance. The product is positioned as a high-reliability solution based on its track record in the broadcasting industry and is adopted in mastering studios and production environments. In the Japanese market, it is distributed through authorized dealer Emilai INC, which provides a 2-year extended warranty.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measured performance achieves industry-leading standards. With a THD+N of less than 0.0003% and an SNR reaching 128dB, these figures significantly exceed the level of transparency for human hearing. The frequency response is extremely flat at ±0.015dB from 20Hz-20kHz, and the channel separation of over 120dB sufficiently clears the transparency level. The technical approach of summing four of the eight channels of the ESS 9028PRO chip to each output to reduce noise and using dual distortion compensation systems to eliminate harmonic distortion is scientifically valid. These measured values can be evaluated as extremely high in fidelity to the master source.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of the ESS 9028PRO DAC chip, proprietary 4:1 analog summing technology, and the HGC (Hybrid Gain Control) system, which combines active and passive controls, were advanced designs at the time of release. The intersample over protection and professional-level high-output design are also commendable. However, the DAC chip itself is a commercial product. Furthermore, newer and more affordable products have achieved equivalent or superior measured performance using newer generation commercial chips (like the ES9038PRO) and simpler circuit designs. Therefore, from a current technological standpoint, its technical advantage has relatively diminished, and it does not merit a top-tier rating.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against the current Japanese market price of 398,000 JPY, the Topping DX7 Pro+ exists at around 100,000 JPY, offering equivalent or superior functions and comparable or better measured performance. The DX7 Pro+ features a newer ES9038PRO chip, versatile inputs/outputs, and high-performance headphone amplifier and preamplifier functions. The cost-performance is calculated as `100,000 JPY ÷ 398,000 JPY ≒ 0.251`, which rounds to a score of 0.3. While the performance of the DAC3 HGC is excellent, the existence of an alternative at about a quarter of the price makes its cost-performance extremely low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As a long-established manufacturer founded in 1978, Benchmark has cultivated high reliability in the broadcasting industry. In Japan, a 2-year extended warranty is provided by the authorized dealer Emilai INC, automatically applied upon product registration. Factory-direct purchases are also upgraded to a 2-year warranty, and an RMA number-based repair system is in place. The products are described as having a "robust design for a lifetime of use," and their quality control system includes subjecting factory-refurbished units to performance tests equivalent to new products. However, with the rise of emerging manufacturers, it cannot be said to be the highest standard in the industry.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The fundamental approach of pursuing transparency-level sound quality through scientific methods is rational. However, in an era where equivalent measured performance and functionality can be achieved with far cheaper components and simpler designs, it is difficult to find a philosophical necessity that justifies this product's high price. The strategy of maintaining a high price by specializing in the niche market of professional use and adding value through robustness and long-term reliability may be viable as a corporate business. However, from the perspective of pure performance and function versus price, its rationality must be rated as remarkably low. From a general-purpose audio product standpoint, the approach has not fully adapted to the times.

## Advice

When considering a purchase, it is essential to strictly define its intended use. It could be an option for specific professional applications, such as a reference machine in a mastering studio where absolute reliability and long-term manufacturer support are valued more than price. However, for general listening purposes, even if seeking the best possible measured performance, products like the Topping DX7 Pro+ offer equivalent or superior performance at about a quarter of the price. Justifying the 398,000 JPY price is difficult, even when pursuing ultimate performance figures. Unless you place significant value on the brand's history and professional track record, a prudent decision would be to consider more affordable alternatives based on a performance-to-price ratio.
