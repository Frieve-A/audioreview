## Overview

The Benchmark LA4 is an all-analog line preamplifier designed for reference-quality audio systems, positioned between high-performance DACs and power amplifiers. Benchmark Media Systems, established as a professional audio manufacturer, has built reputation in broadcast and mastering applications before expanding into consumer high-end audio. The LA4 features fully-balanced signal paths with 256-step relay-switched volume control, offering 2 balanced and 2 unbalanced stereo inputs, multiple outputs including balanced mono sum, and touch screen control interface with optional IR remote.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The LA4 is sold at an unreasonably high price of 2,950 USD for a preamplifier with only basic functions of selector and volume control. While harmonic distortion of 0.00006% (-125dB) and SNR of 137dB are indeed excellent measurements, the problem is that with such simple functions, there is no way for sound quality to degrade. With basic functions of selector and volume control, signal degradation factors are extremely limited, and products available for hundreds of dollars can achieve sufficiently transparent performance. The LA4's measurement performance advantages lack scientific justification for this price differential, and the pricing is unreasonably high regardless. Since the measurement performance advantages do not translate to meaningful audible improvements, the scientific validity is evaluated as 0.0.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The LA4 provides only basic functions of selector and volume control, containing no technically complex elements whatsoever. Relay-switched volume control is a basic signal switching technology controlled digitally, which is a standard implementation in modern audio equipment. The analog-only design represents an outdated technological approach without digital integration, which is regressive compared to modern technological advancement. For basic functions of selector and volume control, there are no new technological innovations or complexities, and these functions can be realized with only general electronic components and basic circuit design. It is inappropriate to demand high technical expertise for such basic functions, and the technology level is evaluated at the lowest level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The Topping Pre90 at 599 USD provides equivalent user-facing functionality with SNR performance of 124dB, which substantially exceeds the transparent level threshold and represents functionally equivalent audio quality despite the 13dB measurement difference compared to the LA4's >137dB SNR [2]. Both products feature balanced and unbalanced inputs/outputs with precision volume control, with the Pre90 offering the core functionality required for line preamplification applications. CP = 599 USD รท 2950 USD = 0.2. While the LA4 provides additional inputs and features such as mono sum output and touch screen control, these do not constitute essential functional requirements that prevent equivalence determination. Higher-performance alternatives such as the Benchmark HPA4 offer additional functionality but cost more at 2,999 USD. The Simaudio Moon Evolution 740P at 9,500 USD demonstrates significantly inferior measured performance with 120dB SNR and "no more than 0.001%" THD compared to both the LA4 and Pre90 specifications [3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Benchmark provides extended warranty options up to 5 years for USA and Canada customers, with 2-year international coverage exceeding the typical 2-year industry standard [4]. The relay-based analog design incorporates robust components with minimal failure points compared to complex digital processing equipment. Direct manufacturer support infrastructure provides established contact systems and RMA procedures for service requirements. Benchmark's professional audio background establishes strong reliability track record with products "engineered to last a lifetime" according to company statements. The simple analog construction with precision relays and metal-film resistors should provide inherent longevity advantages over designs incorporating complex digital processors or software dependencies. Customer support operates during standard business hours with both phone and email access for technical assistance.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Benchmark's design philosophy is severely lacking in rationality by setting an unreasonably high price of 2,950 USD for basic functions of selector and volume control. While the emphasis on measurement-driven transparency is commendable, selling at this price despite the lack of scientific evidence that the measurement performance advantages provide meaningful audible benefits to human hearing is irrational. The majority of design costs are spent on pursuing excessive measurement performance that does not translate to meaningful audible improvements, providing no practical value to users. The price of 2,950 USD for basic selector and volume control functions represents an unjustifiable price setting that cannot be scientifically justified, and the rationality of design philosophy is evaluated at the lowest level.

## Advice

The Benchmark LA4 is sold at an unreasonably high price of 2,950 USD for basic functions of selector and volume control, and cannot be recommended for purchase. Equivalent basic functionality can be obtained from products available for hundreds of dollars, and the LA4's measurement performance advantages lack scientific justification for this price differential. The price of 2,950 USD for basic selector and volume control functions represents an unjustifiable price setting that cannot be scientifically justified. As a more rational alternative, we strongly recommend removing this product from the system and considering a configuration combining a power amplifier with volume control and a passive selector. This configuration can achieve equivalent functionality at significantly lower cost, and since the measurement performance advantages do not translate to meaningful audible improvements, purchasing at this price is irrational.
