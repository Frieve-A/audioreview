## Overview

The Philips SHP9600 is an open-back over-ear headphone featuring 50mm neodymium drivers. Originally positioned as a mid-range option for casual listening with an MSRP of 129.99 USD, the SHP9600 includes a detachable 3-meter cable with gold-plated connections and comes with both 3.5mm and 6.3mm adapters. Despite marketing claims of "perfectly tuned" drivers and "pristine high frequencies," third-party measurements reveal significant performance limitations that contradict these assertions. While the official Philips product page indicates discontinuation, the headphones remain available through third-party retailers and Amazon.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Based on third-party measurements from DIY-Audio-Heaven, the SHP9600 exhibits severe performance deficiencies. Frequency response shows a substantial -10dB drop from 1kHz to 5kHz, drastically exceeding the ±3dB problematic threshold for headphones [1]. However, DIY-Audio-Heaven notes that due to angled drivers, the 3kHz dip is about 5dB less deep than shown between 2-4kHz due to pinna-gain [1]. THD reaches 10% at 30Hz and remains above 1% at 100Hz, both significantly exceeding the 0.5% problematic level for headphones [1]. The frequency response deviation still represents a significant audible compromise that places the headphones below acceptable performance standards. While the headphones achieve good channel matching above 100Hz, the combination of frequency response irregularities and high distortion levels warrants the lowest evaluation tier.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The SHP9600 employs standard 50mm neodymium drivers with angled positioning—a minor implementation detail that provides marginal acoustic benefits. The open-back design and detachable cable with gold-plated connectors represent established, mature technologies without innovative differentiation. No evidence exists of proprietary patents, cutting-edge technology adoption, or unique technical expertise. The analog-only design lacks modern integration of digital processing, software optimization, or advanced measurement-based tuning approaches that characterize current technology leadership.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At current market price of approximately 75 USD, the SHP9600 is compared against the Superlux HD668B (approximately 30 USD) which demonstrates equivalent-or-better measured performance [2]. The HD668B provides equivalent user-facing functions with 50mm drivers, 58Ω impedance, detachable cable, and semi-open design, while demonstrating improved frequency response that addresses the SHP9600's severe frequency response deviations (-10dB drop from 1kHz to 5kHz) in third-party measurements from DIY-Audio-Heaven [2]. Compared to the SHP9600's high distortion levels (10% THD at 30Hz, >1% at 100Hz), the HD668B also shows high distortion at low frequencies but demonstrates improved performance in the midrange.

CP = 30 USD ÷ 75 USD = 0.4

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Philips provides standard 12-24 month warranty coverage with global support infrastructure and international warranty recognition. The simple passive design with minimal components inherently reduces failure potential. However, the product's uncertain availability status and reduced official support may limit future warranty service and parts supply. Philips maintains an established track record in consumer electronics with over 50 years of headphone experience, providing reasonable confidence in manufacturing quality.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The SHP9600's design philosophy demonstrates significant irrationality. Marketing claims of "perfectly tuned" drivers and "crisp bass, balanced midrange, and pristine high frequencies" are directly contradicted by measured performance showing severe frequency response deviations and high distortion levels. The conservative approach relies solely on mature technologies without measurement-based optimization or modern cost-reduction techniques. No evidence suggests scientific verification of performance claims, while the product's discontinuation indicates limited market success. The design fails to demonstrate rational cost-effectiveness or meaningful technical innovation.

## Advice

The Philips SHP9600 cannot be recommended due to fundamental performance deficiencies documented in third-party measurements. The significant frequency response irregularities and high distortion levels compromise audio fidelity below acceptable standards. Those seeking open-back headphones should prioritize products with verified flat frequency response and low distortion measurements from credible testing sources rather than relying on manufacturer marketing claims. We recommend considering alternatives like the Superlux HD668B, which demonstrates superior measured performance at significantly lower cost.
