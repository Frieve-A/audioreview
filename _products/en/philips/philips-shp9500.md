## Overview

The Philips SHP9500 is a product that was once hailed as the "reference" in the entry-level open-back headphone market for its astounding cost-performance. Even now, long after its discontinuation, its legendary reputation has not faded. It has been cherished by countless audio enthusiasts and PC gamers for its lightweight comfort and an expansive, natural soundstage that was previously unthinkable at this price point. In this review, we will re-evaluate its true worth scientifically and objectively against the standards of today's audio market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While the measurement data for the SHP9500 is commendable considering its price, it presents several challenges from the perspective of modern hi-fi "transparency." The frequency response, though relatively flat in the midrange, exhibits a significant roll-off below 100Hz, lacking the depth and impact of the sub-bass that forms the foundation of music. Furthermore, there are multiple peaks in the high frequencies between 5-10kHz. While this contributes to the SHP9500's characteristic brightness and airiness, it can be perceived as sibilant or unnaturally bright on certain recordings. Other metrics like THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and S/N ratio are not officially published but are presumed to be standard for this price category. These characteristics are a drawback in terms of perfect fidelity to the master recording, but they also create a sense of spaciousness and clarity, so they cannot be dismissed entirely as flaws.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The technology employed in the SHP9500 is not particularly noteworthy for its innovation or uniqueness. The 50mm dynamic drivers and the open-back housing structure are classic, proven approaches in headphone design. However, its value lies in the skillful combination of existing technologies to extract maximum acoustic performance at a low cost. Notable are the subtle considerations for achieving a comfortable fit and natural soundstage, such as angling the drivers to align with the ear and selecting breathable earpad materials. While its pure technological advancement remains at an industry-average level, the design prowess to achieve this level of completeness under the severe constraint of cost is worthy of recognition.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Cost-performance is the primary reason the SHP9500 became a legend, and it unequivocally earns a perfect score. According to the review policy, when searching for the "world's cheapest alternative with equivalent or superior function and performance," it is extremely difficult, even today, to find an open-back headphone cheaper than the SHP9500 (retailing around 67 USD) that matches its neutral sound quality, expansive soundstage, and build quality. Superior subsequent products like the Sennheiser HD 560S (approx. 167 USD) and Hifiman HE400se (approx. 107 USD) surpass the SHP9500 in areas like bass extension and overall resolution, but at a significantly higher price. The SHP9500 continues to be the absolute benchmark for performance in its price range, and with no cheaper alternative available, the score is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a product from the global electronics giant Philips, a certain level of trust can be placed in its basic quality control and support systems. The build quality, while predominantly plastic, is reinforced with a metal headband and is considered very sturdy for its price. Wear and tear on the earpads over long-term use is inevitable, but they are replaceable. Although official repair support is difficult to obtain since the product is discontinued, its simple construction and popularity mean that community-based information and compatible parts are relatively easy to find. Overall, while not at the industry's highest standard, it is deemed to have sufficient reliability considering its price.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design philosophy of the SHP9500 is focused on one thing: "How to provide a natural and wide soundstage experience, characteristic of open-back headphones, within a limited budget." This approach is extremely rational. By avoiding expensive materials and complex mechanisms and concentrating on proven technologies, the cost is effectively allocated to the core of acoustic performance. The compromises seen in measurements, such as the lack of bass and peaks in the treble, can be interpreted as a result of prioritizing perceptual comfort and openness over achieving a perfectly flat response. While it steps back from the ideal of high-fidelity reproduction, this design choice is excellent when considering its role as an "entry point to the joy of audio." The achievement of such a sound with generic components is highly commendable.

## Advice

Even as a discontinued product, the Philips SHP9500 remains an attractive option for many audio enthusiasts. It is an unparalleled introductory model, especially for those looking to enter the world of open-back headphones on a budget of around 100 USD. Its expansive soundstage provides excellent immersion not only for music but also for movies and gaming.

However, due to its open-back design, it provides almost no sound isolation. It is not suitable for use in noisy environments or places where sound leakage would be a concern. Also, the bass is light and lacks impact, so it may not be the best choice for those who enjoy powerful, deep bass, such as in electronic music or hip-hop.

If you are looking for your first pair of authentic headphones or want a comfortable pair for long hours of use at home, the SHP9500 is a product you should definitely consider. It represents the pinnacle of what can be achieved at this price point.
