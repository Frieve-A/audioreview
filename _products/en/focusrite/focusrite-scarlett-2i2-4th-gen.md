## Overview

The Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 4th Generation is a 2-in/2-out USB-C audio interface aimed at home-studio creators. It adds Auto Gain, Clip Safe, re-worked Air modes and a refined headphone amp while keeping 24-bit/192 kHz conversion and simple operation [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Core conversion figures meet or exceed transparent thresholds across multiple metrics. Line outputs are specified at dynamic range 120 dB and THD+N –109 dB; the ADC is specified at dynamic range 120 dB and THD+N –110 dB [1]. Microphone input EIN is –127 dBu (A-weighted) with THD+N around –100 dB at modest gain, and headphone out shows 112–115 dB dynamic range with THD+N down to –108 dB depending on load [1][2]. Independent measurements are available and broadly align with transparency-class results for an entry interface [9]. Taken together, these data justify a score of 0.8.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

4th-gen brings practical processing (Auto Gain/Clip Safe), updated Air modes and a cleaner headphone amp while retaining conventional 2×2 I/O and USB-C. The improvements are usability-focused rather than breakthroughs in fundamental audio technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Cheapest equal-or-better comparator: **TOPPING E2x2 (non-OTG)** at **159 USD** from the official store [6]. It offers 2×2 I/O, 24-bit/192 kHz, 48 V phantom, loopback, and third-party measurements indicating equal-or-higher transparency on key metrics [7][8]. Review target street price: **199 USD** at major US retailers [5].  
**Calculation (USD):** 159 USD ÷ 199 USD = **0.798** → score **0.8** after rounding.

*Equivalence note:* E2x2 provides the same user-facing functions (2×2, phantom power, loopback) and transparent-class THD+N/dynamic-range performance [7][8]. (MOTU M2 is also equal-or-better but not cheaper at ~199.95 USD [4][5].)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Focusrite provides a global **three-year warranty** on all products and 24/7/365 support coverage, which is solid for the class [1][3]. The Scarlett line has a long market history and wide service coverage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design prioritizes preventing ruined takes (Auto Gain/Clip Safe), clear metering (halos) and sensible gain range (69 dB) over flashy hardware changes. That emphasis yields real-world recording benefits for newcomers and streamers [1][2].

## Advice

If you want a **plug-and-go** 2×2 with safety nets (Auto Gain/Clip Safe) and transparent core metrics, 2i2 is easy to recommend. If you optimize strictly for **price vs. transparent performance**, check TOPPING E2x2 (cheaper with comparable or better measured transparency) [6][8]. If you want loopback plus color screens and are fine at the same price, MOTU M2 remains a popular alternative [4][5].
