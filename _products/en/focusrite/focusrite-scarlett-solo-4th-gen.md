summary: "Single-input USB-C interface with two Air modes, loopback, and 24-bit/192kHz conversion. Lab-grade specs reach transparency; feature set is simpler than 2i2/4i4. Among interfaces with equal-or-better measured transparency, Solo is currently the cheapest widely available option."

## Overview

Scarlett Solo 4th Gen targets solo creators with one mic pre, one Hi-Z instrument input, balanced line outs, headphone out, and system loopback. It adds re-engineered **Air** with two modes (Presence and Harmonic Drive) and uses converters derived from Focusrite’s RedNet line. Specified support spans 24-bit/192kHz and class-compliant USB-C operation. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate transparency in normal use: mic input frequency response 20Hz–20kHz ±0.06dB; mic input dynamic range **113dB (A-weighted)**; **THD+N −100dB** (@ min gain); **EIN −127dBu**; balanced line-out dynamic range **120dB**; headphone dynamic range **112–115dB** depending on load. These values imply inaudible coloration/noise under typical conditions, with audibility limited by transducers and room rather than the interface. Large-sample third-party measurements on Solo (4th Gen) remain sparse; figures here are manufacturer specifications. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Two Air modes (Presence, Harmonic Drive) and loopback are practical, but Solo’s preamp gain range is **57dB**, lower than the **69dB** front ends and added **Auto Gain/Clip Safe** on 2i2/4i4 of the same generation. Hardware and app integration are contemporary; omission of assisted-gain features keeps ambition below class leaders. [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market price at review: **149 USD** (Focusrite US store). Among interfaces we can verify as **equal-or-better in measured transparency**, the **cheapest widely available alternative** is **Solid State Logic SSL 2 MKII** at **~179 USD** (monitor outputs dynamic range 120dB). **MOTU M2** is another equal-or-better option at ~199 USD (120dB output DR, −129dBu EIN). In contrast, **Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD** is cheaper (**86.90 USD**) but publishes **110dB (A-weighted)** system dynamic range, which is below Solo’s output DR and mic/line specs; it therefore does **not** meet the “equal-or-better measurement” requirement for the comparator, even though it is likely transparent for many uses. [2][4][5][6][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Focusrite provides a **three-year warranty** and global support. Scarlett has broad DAW compatibility and ongoing driver/app updates via Focusrite Control 2. Construction is robust with few wear-out parts, aligning with low inherent failure risk. [2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design prioritizes measurable transparency (flat FR, low THD+N, high DR) and workflow features (loopback, Air). Choosing a 57dB preamp without Auto Gain/Clip Safe is conservative versus sibling models, but the engineering targets audible outcomes rather than boutique myths. [1][2][3]

## Advice

Choose Solo if you want a compact, simple interface with **loopback** and **two Air modes** at low complexity. If you need more gain on very low-output mics or want **Auto Gain/Clip Safe**, the **Scarlett 2i2 4th Gen** is safer. If your priority is the **absolute lowest price**, **UMC202HD** is a workable **budget** alternative but falls short of Solo’s published measurement performance; if you want **equal-or-better measurements**, look to **SSL 2 MKII** or **MOTU M2** (both cost more). [2][3][4][5][6][7]
