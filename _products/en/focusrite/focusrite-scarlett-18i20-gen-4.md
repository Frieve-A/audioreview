## Overview

The Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 Gen 4 is a professional-grade 18in20out audio interface released in 2024. It incorporates converters from the flagship RedNet series, achieving 122dB dynamic range. Equipped with 8 Scarlett microphone preamps, Auto Gain, and Clip Safe functions, it supports 192kHz/24bit sampling. Focusrite is a veteran UK audio manufacturer established in 1985 with proven professional studio credentials.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The RedNet converter implementation achieves 122dB dynamic range, with microphone preamps providing 69dB of gain and excellent THD performance of -100dB. Supporting 192kHz/24bit sampling, it delivers performance well beyond the human audible range. The Auto Gain function automatically sets optimal gain levels, while Clip Safe prevents clipping. These features provide measurable audio quality improvements with scientifically-based effectiveness.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adaptation of RedNet series converter technology to lower-tier products is commendable, though fundamentally represents existing technology transfer. Functions like Auto Gain, Clip Safe, and Dynamic Halos are practical, achieving convenience improvements through software control. The 8 microphone preamp design meets industry standard levels, representing reliable design rather than revolutionary technology. ADAT expansion capability for 16 additional channels is practical.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Against the current price of approximately ¥93,000, the PreSonus Studio 1824c (¥57,750) offers equivalent 18in20out configuration. The Studio 1824c features 115dB dynamic range and XMAX preamps, with limited practical audio quality differences. CP = 57,750 ÷ 93,000 = 0.62, presenting price competitiveness challenges. Even considering additional features like RedNet converters and Auto Gain, the cost for pure audio quality performance is relatively high.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Focusrite has a strong track record as a veteran manufacturer, with product reliability at a high level. The domestic authorized dealer provides 3-year warranty with continuous firmware updates. Strong professional studio adoption record proves long-term reliability. USB-C connector adoption ensures future compatibility. However, considering the price range, it's not entirely comprehensive.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The rational design achieves reliable audio quality improvement through RedNet converter technology transfer. Software-controlled functions like Auto Gain and Clip Safe are modern and practical. However, the 18in20out configuration seems questionable. For professional use, 32in32out is typical, while 8in8out suffices for semi-professional applications, making this configuration's necessity limited. High costs due to audio-dedicated enclosures also lack rationality when considering advances in general-purpose solutions.

## Advice

While the Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 Gen 4 certainly achieves high audio quality, it faces significant price competitiveness challenges. Considering the reality that PreSonus Studio 1824c offers equivalent functionality with approximately ¥35,000 price difference, purchase reasons are limited. If prioritizing Focusrite brand or RedNet converters, it becomes an option, but cost-performance focused alternatives are more rational. For professional studio operations, consider larger 32in32out or higher products. For DTM users, 8in8out class products often suffice.

## Additional Information

Included software features Hitmaker Expansion and Pro Tools Artist. ADAT expansion enables up to 16 additional input/output channels. Equipped with 4 endless encoders and Dynamic Gain Halos visual feedback functionality.
