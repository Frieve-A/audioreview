summary: "Four-channel transformer-input mic pre with variable impedance, per-channel HPF/insert/DI, and optional 8-channel 24-bit/192 kHz A-D (ISA ADN8). We verify the key specs from the official manual, note the limited third-party lab data, and compute Cost-Performance against the cheapest equal-or-better current alternative."

## Overview

ISA428 MkII packs four transformer-input Focusrite mic pres into a 2U chassis with per-channel HPF, phase, insert, DI, LED metering and switchable input impedance. With the optional ISA ADN8 card, it adds AES3/ADAT/Dante up to 24-bit/192 kHz for straightforward DAW integration and network workflows[1][2][3]. It remains a workhorse front end in many studios.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comprehensive third-party lab data are limited, so we anchor to the official specs. Mic input S/N is 122 dB (A-weighted, typical), frequency response 20 Hz–20 kHz ±0.2 dB (10 Hz–110 kHz ±1.5 dB), THD+N −92 dB (0.0025%) @ −1 dBr, and EIN < −123 dBu (A-weighted, max gain)[1] — values near the transparency targets in audible terms. Given the lack of independent measurements across units, we keep a conservative 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design offers four selectable input impedances (600 Ω / 1.4 kΩ / 2.4 kΩ / 6.8 kΩ), per-channel 18 dB/oct HPF and inserts[1]. The ISA ADN8 option adds 8-channel 24-bit/192 kHz conversion with Dante/AES3/ADAT and Word Clock I/O, easing integration into modern hybrid and AoIP setups[2][3]. Solid engineering and expandability justify 0.8.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Current market price of the review unit: 1999 USD[4][5]. The cheapest equal-or-better alternative is **Focusrite Clarett+ OctoPre** (8 preamps, EIN −129 dBu, THD+N −110 dB, 118 dB DR, ADAT I/O, Air impedance/voicing)[6][7]. **Computation**: 899.99 USD ÷ 1999 USD = 0.45 → rounds to **0.5**. Functionally it exceeds channel count and digital I/O; on measured performance it is equal-or-better under the stated conditions, so it is a valid comparator.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Focusrite provides a three-year warranty on all products[8][9]. As an analog device there are no firmware-maintenance risks. With long studio track records and accessible service, 0.8 is appropriate.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Transformer coupling has rational engineering goals (galvanic isolation, handling of common-mode content), and variable input impedance is a practical tool for mic loading and matching. Per-channel HPF/inserts and the clean upgrade path to Dante/AES3/ADAT via ISA ADN8 further support workflow rationality. However, the philosophy favors "character options" over maximizing transparency-per-dollar, so we set **0.4**.

## Advice

If you need transformer-coupled character and variable impedance for vintage mics, ISA428 MkII delivers proven performance. For modern transparency and higher channel count at lower cost, Clarett+ OctoPre offers better measured specs and more flexibility. Consider ISA428 MkII if you specifically value the transformer sound and impedance options; otherwise, Clarett+ OctoPre provides superior cost-performance and modern connectivity.
