## Overview

The Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd Generation is a compact 2-in/2-out USB audio interface for solo creators. It offers a single XLR mic input, one instrument input, 24-bit/192 kHz conversion, and bus-powered USB connectivity. The 3rd-gen Scarlett preamp includes the analog Air circuit for an optional high-frequency lift, and the “gain halo” LEDs ease level setting for entry-level users.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Manufacturer performance (AES17 where possible) shows mic-in dynamic range 111 dB(A), line-in 110.5 dB(A), and instrument-in 110 dB(A). THD+N is <0.0012% (mic, min gain, −1 dBFS, 22 Hz–22 kHz), <0.002% (line), and <0.03% (instrument). Frequency response is 20 Hz–20 kHz within ±0.1 dB. These exceed transparent thresholds for DR and distortion in typical use; only the instrument input’s THD+N is above the 0.01% “ideal” line yet remains inaudibly low in practice [1]. Independent community testing reports ~108 dB(A) mic-in dynamic range for Solo Gen3, consistent with catalog figures [2]. Air mode is an analog FR modification rather than DSP, aligning with measurable behavior [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design uses mature USB 2.0 audio with 24-bit/192 kHz converters, a competent preamp stage, and the analog Air EQ circuit. It’s an evolutionary refinement over Gen2 rather than new architecture. Implementation quality is solid, but there’s no distinctive patent-level innovation or novel topology that moves the category forward.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Street price used for evaluation: 105 USD. The cheapest equal-or-better alternative we could identify is the **Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD** (2×2, two mic pres, 24-bit/192 kHz; manufacturer DR 110 dB(A)), which matches or exceeds user-visible functions and meets transparent-level performance on core specs [5].  
**Calculation:** 58 USD ÷ 105 USD = 0.552 → rounded to **0.6**.  
This reflects strong value for Solo Gen3, but UMC202HD undercuts it on price while meeting equivalent performance for typical home-studio needs.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Focusrite offers a **three-year warranty** globally on hardware purchased after Jan 1, 2018 [4]. Windows drivers and regular Control app updates are provided; macOS operates class-compliant without a custom driver, with Control for configuration [6]. USB-C iPad models are officially supported for Solo Gen3 when connected per Focusrite’s guidance [3]. Overall reliability and support infrastructure are above average for the segment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The product targets measurable transparency at accessible cost—dynamic range and FR flatness are within transparent bounds, and Air is a clearly stated analog FR tweak rather than a nebulous “magic” mode [1][7]. The feature set focuses on practical solo workflows without superfluous claims, aligning with scientifically meaningful improvements.

## Advice

Choose Scarlett Solo 3rd Gen if you need a simple, bus-powered 24-bit/192 kHz interface with a clean mic pre and reliable cross-platform operation. Measured performance comfortably meets transparent thresholds, and Air offers a gentle, repeatable high-shelf character if desired. If you require two simultaneous mic inputs or want the lowest price for equivalent transparency, the Behringer UMC202HD is the stronger bargain; otherwise, the Solo remains a safe, well-supported pick.
