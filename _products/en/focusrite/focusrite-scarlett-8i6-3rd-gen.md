## Overview

The Focusrite Scarlett 8i6 3rd Gen is an 8-input, 6-output USB 2.0 audio interface designed for multi-track recording. It features upgraded Scarlett preamps with “Air” mode, up to 24-bit/192 kHz operation, and comprehensive I/O including S/PDIF digital connections. It targets producers and creators who need several simultaneous inputs for band tracking, podcasting with outboard gear, or hybrid hardware setups.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specifications report mic preamp dynamic range of 111 dB (A-wtd), line input dynamic range of 110.5 dB (A-wtd), and line output dynamic range of 108 dB (A-wtd), with THD+N below 0.002% in typical operating conditions. These values indicate performance at transparent thresholds for modern interfaces. Independent third-party lab measurements remain limited; therefore this is a **provisional** score based on published specifications pending broader external verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 8i6 3rd Gen is an incremental evolution of a proven architecture: USB 2.0 connectivity with competent 24-bit/192 kHz converters, “Air” voicing, loopback, and S/PDIF I/O for external routing. It favors reliably executed fundamentals over cutting-edge features like onboard DSP or networked audio.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market pricing for the 8i6 3rd Gen is 299.99 USD. Among interfaces that are equal or better in functionality (including S/PDIF I/O and comparable or superior measured performance), the cheapest widely available alternative is the PreSonus Studio 1810c at 299.99 USD. Because the lowest-price equal-or-better option is at parity, the score is maximized.

**Comparator used:** PreSonus Studio 1810c — 8 analog inputs (4 mic pres + 4 line), stereo S/PDIF I/O, mic/line dynamic range up to ~110–112 dB (A-wtd). Price: 299.99 USD.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Focusrite provides a 3-year warranty on new products, with mature drivers and regular software updates via Focusrite Control. The Scarlett line has a strong reliability record in home-studio use and globally accessible support channels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Design choices prioritize transparent capture, straightforward routing, and practical digital I/O over experimental features. “Air” mode offers purposeful coloration when desired, but the overall platform stays conservative and functional.

## Advice

If you specifically need S/PDIF and around eight analog inputs in a compact desktop unit, 8i6 remains a sensible pick at its price. If you might benefit from more onboard mic pres while keeping S/PDIF, the Studio 1810c is the lateral alternative at the same price. For larger I/O counts or advanced DSP, plan for higher budgets.
