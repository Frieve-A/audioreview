## Overview

The Tiglon MGT-90Pro is a fixed-height speaker stand released in June 2024, representing the company's merger of their original MGT magnesium technology with professional studio stand design. Standing 90cm tall and weighing 8.4kg per unit, the stand features magnesium alloy construction with sand filling, marketed as providing "realistic sound field expression and reliability of recording studios." Tiglon developed the world's first magnesium speaker stand in 2004 and holds a "Magnesium Shield" patent from 2009. The MGT-90Pro is positioned as a premium product at 588 USD per pair, targeting audiophiles seeking claimed vibration control and audio quality improvements.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

This evaluation examines measurable performance improvements affecting audible thresholds. The MGT-90Pro falls under the framework's category of high-priced products claiming audible sound quality improvement without scientific validation. No acoustic measurements demonstrate audible improvements, no ABX tests or blind trials exist, and no measured data shows frequency response impact, THD reduction, or other audio quality metrics. Claims of "realistic sound field expression" and "neutral character" lack scientific validation. At 588 USD, this constitutes a significant price premium for a speaker stand making audibility claims without scientific evidence, warranting the minimum score of 0.0.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The MGT-90Pro demonstrates average technological sophistication. Positive aspects include in-house design and development of the magnesium alloy construction with sand filling. The company holds a "Magnesium Shield" patent from 2009, though this technology is now mature rather than cutting-edge. The extruded magnesium tubes are alloyed with manganese for strength and filled with ultra-fine sand for vibration damping. However, the technology lacks modern integration elements like digital processing or software components, relying purely on analog/mechanical approaches. While the manufacturing expertise shows accumulated know-how in specialized materials, the technology offers limited appeal to other manufacturers and presents no significant competitive advantage duration.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Cost-performance analysis reveals poor value proposition. The review target provides fixed ~90cm height household speaker support at 588 USD. An equivalent-or-better household alternative is the On-Stage SMS6000-P at 136.95 USD per pair, offering floor-standing platform tops, 36.5–54 inch height range (covers the required ~90cm), and 90 lbs load capacity—fulfilling user-facing functionality and core performance at or above the review target. CP = 136.95 USD ÷ 588 USD = 0.233 → 0.2. Given substantially lower cost for equivalent speaker support functionality, the MGT-90Pro’s price premium is not justified.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The MGT-90Pro demonstrates above-average reliability potential. The magnesium alloy construction with sand filling represents a robust design with few moving parts, inherently resistant to degradation and failure. The simple mechanical structure minimizes potential failure points compared to adjustable alternatives. Tiglon's operational history since 2004 suggests reasonable manufacturer longevity and established track record. However, specific warranty periods and support infrastructure details remain unspecified. The company appears to follow dealer-based support models typical of specialized audio manufacturers. The robust construction and established manufacturer presence support a reliability score above the baseline average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates poor scientific rationality. The company claims vibration control effects without measured proof of audibility, violating evidence-based design principles. The 588 USD cost cannot be justified by measurable performance improvements, representing poor cost optimization relative to functional benefits. Claims of "realistic sound field expression" lack scientific evidence, falling into the category of unsubstantiated audibility claims. The product exhibits questionable justification for audio-specific high pricing when basic stands provide equivalent function. While some engineering approach is evident in materials selection, the overall philosophy prioritizes unverified subjective claims over objective performance validation, earning the minimum rationality score.

## Advice

The MGT-90Pro cannot be recommended due to fundamental value and validation issues. At 588 USD, equivalent speaker support functionality is available for under 150 USD with additional height adjustability benefits. The claimed audible improvements lack scientific validation through measurement or controlled testing. Potential purchasers should consider professional-grade adjustable stands that provide superior versatility at fraction of the cost. For those specifically seeking magnesium construction, ensure any claimed benefits are supported by independent measurements rather than manufacturer marketing. The premium pricing appears unjustified given the absence of measurable performance advantages over conventional alternatives. Consider allocating the cost difference toward measurably superior audio components with validated performance improvements.
