## Overview

The Nagaoka NTYPEC02 is a canal-type wired earphone with USB-C connection support, released in June 2025. It features ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) functionality, which is rare in the 23 USD (tax included) price range, and incorporates aluminum housing for improved sound isolation. With a 12mm driver and a built-in DAC supporting 96kHz/24bit, it enables direct processing of digital audio. This product represents the company's new expansion into modern digital audio equipment, marking a departure from its traditional analog cartridge specialization.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The basic specifications, including a 20Hz-20kHz frequency response from the 12mm driver and 32Ω/108±3dB, provide standard performance for this price range. The built-in DAC supporting 96kHz/24bit via USB-C connection contributes to faithful digital source reproduction by minimizing losses in the analog conversion stage. Specific performance values for the ANC function, such as the amount of noise reduction, and detailed specifications for THD and S/N ratio are not published. No third-party measurement reports are currently available. Based on the public information, while it does not reach transparent levels according to the measurement result reference table, it is considered to avoid problematic levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The adoption of a USB-C connection with a built-in DAC and 96kHz/24bit support demonstrates the implementation of modern digital audio technology. The ANC function also applies standard technology, using microphones to detect environmental sound and digital signal processing for noise elimination. The 12mm driver size is appropriate, and resonance suppression through the aluminum housing represents a rational design. However, these technical elements are a combination of existing technologies that have become generalized in the industry, with limited uniqueness or advancement. While the company's effort to transition from analog to digital technology is commendable, its technical superiority remains at the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

As USB-C connected earphones with ANC functionality, the NTYPEC02 is positioned in an extremely rare price range. Competing products with equivalent functionality, such as the Audio-Technica ATH-CKS330NC (market price around 33 USD), exist, but none are found at a lower price than this product (23 USD). Alternatives without ANC, like the Apple EarPods USB-C (18 USD) and Final E500 (13 USD), are functionally inferior and thus not suitable for comparison. Products offering both ANC and a USB-C connection for under 33 USD are extremely limited, and since this model achieves the lowest price for this feature combination, it receives the highest cost-performance rating.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While Nagaoka has an 85-year corporate history and a stable manufacturing track record in the analog field, the NTYPEC02 is the company's first digital audio product, making its track record in this area unknown. The precision processing technology cultivated through traditional analog cartridge manufacturing is expected to contribute to quality control, but there is no history regarding failure modes specific to digital audio equipment or long-term reliability. Domestic support is expected to be similar to that for existing products, but the support system for digital-specific aspects like firmware updates is unclear. Reliability in this new product category is evaluated at an industry-average level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Digital audio transmission via USB-C connection is rational in terms of noise resistance and signal quality compared to traditional 3.5mm analog connections. The built-in DAC supporting 96kHz/24bit enables high-quality reproduction of digital sources. The incorporation of ANC functionality is a rational choice that directly improves usability in modern mobile environments. The business expansion from analog cartridge specialization to digital audio equipment is also a strategic decision that responds to market trends. The pricing is set at an appropriate level that considers market acceptance while differentiating from competitors. This represents a modern, scientifically-based approach to the company's technological direction.

## Advice

For users who need ANC functionality in a USB-C connection environment, the NTYPEC02 is currently the most cost-effective choice on the market. If ANC is not a requirement, cheaper alternatives like the Final E500 (13 USD) or Apple EarPods USB-C (18 USD) exist. However, if ANC is an essential requirement, the next cheapest option is the Audio-Technica ATH-CKS330NC (around 33 USD), which has a significant price difference. For those seeking the combination of ANC and a USB-C connection in this price range, this is effectively the only rational choice. Users requiring higher-quality ANC performance will need to increase their budget, but this product is optimal for basic needs. While Nagaoka is an established manufacturer with a long history in analog products, this is their new venture into the digital field; basic quality control can be expected, but long-term reliability is yet to be proven.
