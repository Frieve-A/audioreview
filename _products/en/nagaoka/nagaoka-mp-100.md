## Overview

The NAGAOKA MP-100 is an MM cartridge manufactured by Nagaoka, a Japanese company specializing in record styli. Based on technology from the 1970s, it is positioned as an entry-level model featuring a bonded conical stylus. With specifications including an output voltage of 3.5mV, a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz, and a tracking force of 1.5-2.5g, it ensures compatibility with many turntables. It is a practical product for analog enthusiasts, with a stylus replacement service available in Japan.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While the bonded conical stylus provides basic tracing capability to read information from record grooves, its scientific validity is limited. Due to the physical limitations of MM cartridges, its performance is significantly inferior to modern digital sources. Even within the 20Hz-20kHz frequency range, there are deviations of over ±3dB, and the S/N ratio is only around 70dB. Inherent analog record issues like wow and flutter, pop/click noise, and distortion rates exceeding 0.5% are not fundamentally resolved. These measurements are at a "problematic level" by modern standards, and its scientific fidelity must be considered remarkably low.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The adoption of a bonded conical stylus and the magnetic circuit design conform to the technical standards of the 1970s, showing no technological advancement. The user-replaceable stylus is practical, but the design lacks technological innovation and has no notable proprietary technology from an industry-wide perspective. While the manufacturing quality is stable, its technical level is significantly below average compared to modern MC cartridges and digital technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Audio-Technica AT-VM95E (retailing around 69 USD) features a higher-performance elliptical stylus and offers superior frequency response. Compared to the MP-100's retail price of about 150 USD, the AT-VM95E provides better performance for about half the price. The CP is calculated as 69 USD ÷ 150 USD ≒ 0.46, meaning its cost performance is not high. The Ortofon 2M Red (retailing around 99 USD) also receives higher technical evaluation in a similar price range, making the MP-100 not competitively advantageous.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Nagaoka has a long history as a Japanese record stylus specialist and supports long-term use through its stylus replacement service. However, its global sales network is limited, and availability and support overseas are inferior to other international cartridge manufacturers. The product's durability is standard, and the warranty period is at the industry average. While reliable as a specialized manufacturer, it is not at the highest level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

While the design leverages the company's expertise as a record stylus specialist, the physical limitations of analog records (wow and flutter, S/N ratio limits, distortion) remain unresolved in 2025. With digital sources (streaming, CD, high-res) offering overwhelmingly superior sound quality, the necessity for a dedicated analog device is extremely low. The user-replaceable stylus is practical, but the fundamental design philosophy is severely lacking in modern digital-era rationality.

## Advice

If you are considering a purchase, first clarify your use case and budget. If you need an MM cartridge, the Audio-Technica AT-VM95E offers a higher-performance elliptical stylus and superior frequency response for around 69 USD. Alternatively, the Ortofon 2M Red is highly regarded technically and costs around 99 USD.

This pricing is only justifiable if your main purpose is to utilize a vintage record collection. However, if you are purely pursuing sound quality, you will get overwhelmingly better results in measurable sound quality by building a digital audio system (streaming device, DAC, headphones) with the same budget.

Not recommended for those seeking scientific superiority in sound quality.
