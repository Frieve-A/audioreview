rating: [1.7, 0.3, 0.6, 0.0, 0.6, 0.2]
price: 7500
summary: "An iconic 2×75W vacuum-tube power amp whose measured performance is solid for a transformer-coupled tube design but clearly below modern transparent benchmarks; superb build and service tradition, yet cost-performance is extremely poor versus today’s objectively clean solid-state alternatives."

## Overview

The sixth-generation MC275 is a 2-channel vacuum-tube power amplifier rated at 75W per channel into 4/8/16Ω (150W mono parallel). McIntosh’s Unity Coupled output transformers, Sentry Monitor protection, and polished stainless chassis remain the defining features. Manufacturer specs cite 0.5% THD, 105dB S/N (at rated output), and damping factor >22; third-party lab work confirms wide bandwidth and comparatively low source impedance for a tube design, but performance remains well short of modern transparent solid-state amplifiers [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Third-party measurements show unusually wide bandwidth (–3dB ≈ 91kHz) and small FR interaction with a simulated speaker (≈±0.5dB from the 8Ω tap). However, THD+N stays well above transparent thresholds: ≈0.05–0.1% at modest levels depending on tap/load, and up to the 0.5% spec near rated power. A-weighted S/N at 1W was about 100–101dB, below the 105dB “transparent” yardstick; channel separation exceeded 90dB. Damping factor is specification >22 (order-of-magnitude below modern high-feedback designs). Net-net: good for a transformer-coupled tube amp, but not transparent by strict modern criteria [1][2][4].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

In-house transformer design (Unity Coupled), robust safety/connection systems (Sentry Monitor, Solid Cinch), and long accumulated know-how support a respectable technology score. That said, the approach is mature analog with limited digital/software integration or novel control techniques today [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Current US street price for MC275 VI is 7,500 USD [3]. The cheapest finished product we can identify that is equal-or-better in user-visible functions and measured performance is TOPPING PA7: 2-channel power amp with balanced and unbalanced inputs; measured/quoted THD+N down to 0.0003% at 8Ω/20W (balanced), SNR up to 127dB, and 135W×2 into 8Ω at <1% THD+N (far higher clean output than MC275). Price: 296.65 USD [6].  
Calculation (policy formula, single comparator):  
296.65 USD ÷ 7,500 USD = 0.0396 ⇒ **0.0** (rounded to one decimal).  
Equivalence note: same core function (stereo power amplification), with lower distortion and higher SNR/output power on the comparator [6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

McIntosh provides a 3-year limited warranty (tubes 90 days) via authorized dealers and service agencies; historically, the brand maintains serviceability and parts for many years. The tube output stage is inherently consumable/heat-stressed versus solid-state, moderating the score. Net result: slightly above average support and history with tube-amp caveats [1][8].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Prioritizing vacuum tubes and large output transformers is a conservative, heritage-driven choice that predictably trades measurable fidelity (THD+N, damping factor) for a particular operating philosophy and industrial design. Costs concentrate on non-performance-critical factors (materials/finish/transformers) rather than improvements to measurable audibility; as such, the direction is scientifically irrational relative to transparent-first design goals.

## Advice

Buy MC275 VI only if you specifically want a premium tube amplifier with McIntosh aesthetics, build, and dealer ecosystem. For audibly transparent amplification at a fraction of the price and with far lower distortion/noise, choose a modern solid-state power amp like TOPPING PA7 (desktop/stereo systems) [6]. If you need very high continuous power for difficult speakers, consider a high-power solid-state unit such as Emotiva XPA-DR2 (balanced inputs, 550W/8Ω per ch claimed; check latest pricing/availability) [10].
