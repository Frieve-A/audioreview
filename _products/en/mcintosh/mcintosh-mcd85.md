## Overview

The McIntosh MCD85 is a current-production SACD/CD player released in February 2021. It combines traditional disc playback with a USB Audio input supporting up to DSD256 and DXD 384kHz, and uses a quad-balanced 8-channel 32-bit/192kHz DAC topology (four DAC channels per stereo channel) in a compact, retro-styled chassis with die-cast aluminum construction and direct LED backlighting [2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent lab tests show audibly transparent performance. Hi-Fi News measured ~0.01% THD across the top 40dB of the dynamic range, A-weighted S/N of 114dB (24-bit LPCM) and 109dB (SACD/DSD64), and a linear-phase steep filter with >115dB stopband rejection for CD. LPCM inputs are truncated below about –104dBFS (visible as a “step” in low-level distortion plots), while SACD retains ±0.2dB resolution down to –120dBFS. Frequency response peaks to +0.3dB/20kHz (CD/48k) and +0.6dB/45kHz (96k), within transparent limits [1]. Manufacturer documentation confirms USB support up to DSD256/DXD384k [2][3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The digital front end marries Crystal’s CS8421 sample-rate converter to ESS’s ES9016S DAC, capping LPCM at 192kHz. Hi-Fi News confirms this implementation choice and its behavior, including jitter performance (e.g., 115ps via USB, 30ps with SACD) [1]. The 2× read speed with buffer memory and twin-laser optical pickup are competent, established solutions rather than cutting-edge developments. Overall, the design is solid engineering with conservative choices rather than novel digital processing [1][2][3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At 4500 USD, the cheapest *functionally equivalent* path is **Denon DCD-1700NE** (SACD/CD player with analog out; S/N 119dB, THD 0.001%) for **1,699 USD** plus a **Topping E30 II** USB DAC (USB/coax/optical; measured transparent-class performance) for **149 USD**, totaling **1,848 USD** [4][5][6][7][8].  
**Equivalence note (user view):** Provides SACD/CD disc playback to analog outputs, adds USB DAC with equal-or-better headline transparency (S/N/THD/SINAD), and matches or exceeds format support (DSD up to DSD512 on the DAC) [4][5][7].  
**CP calculation:** 1,848 USD ÷ 4,500 USD = **0.410… → 0.4** (rounded to 1 decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

McIntosh’s service network and parts support are well established. The transport uses a dual-laser pickup and buffered read scheme; the mechanical complexity of the die-cast loader may add service cost versus simpler mechanisms, but overall construction quality is high and the product remains current for support continuity [2][3].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The MCD85 pursues measurable transparency without resorting to non-scientific claims. Its quad-balanced DAC topology plausibly aids channel separation and noise rejection, but the engineering emphasis is conservative (no advanced room/DSP features). Aesthetic and build investments are substantial, delivering an object of desire more than a breakthrough in digital processing [1][2][3].

## Advice

Buy the MCD85 if you value McIntosh design/build and want a one-box SACD/CD player that measures to transparent levels with a convenient USB input. If your priority is price-to-performance, the Denon DCD-1700NE plus a transparent USB DAC like the Topping E30 II achieves the same user-visible functions and equal-or-better measured transparency for ~41% of the cost, freeing budget for speakers/room treatment where audibility gains are larger [4][5][7].
