## Overview

CCA (Clear Concept Audio) is a subsidiary brand of KZ focusing on hybrid driver configurations. The C10 features a 5-driver hybrid design per side with 1 dynamic driver (10 mm) and 4 balanced armatures. The aluminum faceplate and clear acrylic body mirror common KZ/CCA construction and deliver reasonable build quality for the price. The stock cable uses a 0.75 mm 2-pin connector, allowing easy cable replacement [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent lab measurements show manufacturer-rated 32 Ω impedance and 108 dB sensitivity are conservative: measured sensitivity is 115.8 dB (1 mW, 32 Ω, 300 Hz–3 kHz window), ensuring easy drive from virtually any source [1]. Frequency response deviates from transparency targets with ~2–3 dB excess in upper-bass (≈80–250 Hz) and ~2–3 dB deficit below ≈70 Hz versus a Harman-aligned reference; mids/treble sit broadly in the “normal” ballpark [1]. Total harmonic distortion measured “pretty close to zip,” and the impedance curve is atypical for multi-BA IEMs, falling above ~5 kHz; with high-impedance sources this yields ~1.5–3 dB less output from 6–15 kHz (a mild softening rather than a tonal shift) [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A conventional budget hybrid (1DD+4BA) with a simple crossover and established materials. No notable innovations in driver tech, acoustical topology, or manufacturing are evidenced beyond basic multi-driver execution typical of the segment. Fit/finish are serviceable, but the engineering ambition appears limited by cost.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Market price is 38 USD. The **Moondrop Chu II** at **18.99 USD** provides equivalent user-facing functions (wired IEM, detachable cable) and **equal-or-better measured fidelity in frequency response** relative to target curves per third-party testing, while retaining standardized 0.78 mm 2-pin connectivity [3][4][8]. **Calculation:** 18.99 USD ÷ 38 USD = **0.50**.  
**Equivalence note:** Chu II is a single-dynamic IEM tuned close to the manufacturer’s VDSF/HATS target with documented third-party measurements; distortion claims are modest (manufacturer THD ≤0.5 % @1 kHz, 94 dB) and no credible evidence suggests worse audibility than the C10 in normal use [3][4][8]. Therefore a materially similar or better listening result is obtainable for about half the price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Build quality is typical for the class (metal faceplate, acrylic shell). The detachable 0.75 mm 2-pin cable eases replacement; long-term reliability data remain limited, and support infrastructure is average for low-cost Chinese IEMs [2]. No systemic failure rates or superior QC programs are documented.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Tuning targets mainstream listening with elevated upper-bass and brighter lower-treble relative to a neutral reference, trading transparency for liveliness [1]. Multi-driver complexity adds cost without clear measured advantages over well-executed single-driver designs, indicating a marketing-led rather than measurement-led philosophy.

## Advice

If you want **higher fidelity per dollar**, prioritize the Moondrop Chu II: comparable functionality, broadly target-aligned tuning, and detachable 0.78 mm cable at roughly half the price (18.99 USD vs 38 USD) [3][4][8]. The C10 still suits listeners who **specifically prefer extra upper-bass energy** and value multi-driver appeal over strict neutrality. For critical, reference-leaning listening, step up to models with verified transparency-level tuning and low distortion backed by comprehensive third-party data.
