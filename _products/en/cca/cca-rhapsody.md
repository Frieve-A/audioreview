## Overview

The CCA Rhapsody is a 6-driver hybrid in-ear monitor (IEM) that combines two 8mm dynamic drivers (DD) and four 31736 balanced armature (BA) drivers. Its standout feature is a 4-stage frequency adjustment switch, allowing users to physically customize the sound. Utilizing a 3D-printed cavity design and a silver-plated copper cable, it implements a complex technical configuration, typically seen in higher-end models, at a price of around 45 USD. CCA is known as the sister brand of KZ, a Chinese audio manufacturer with over a decade of experience, and is recognized for its high cost-performance products.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

According to reliable third-party measurement data, this product's fidelity to the master recording is not high. The frequency response depends heavily on the switch settings, but all configurations exhibit significant peaks and dips exceeding ±3dB across the audible spectrum, falling far short of the ideal transparent level (±0.5dB). Particularly, multiple peaks and valleys in the mid-to-high frequencies interfere with the accurate reproduction of the source material. The Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is also problematic, reaching problematic levels (above 0.5%) in some bands, especially exceeding 1% in the low frequencies. Overall, the performance is far from an excellent level (below 0.05%). These measurements suggest the product is tuned for a specific sound signature rather than for scientific fidelity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A 6-driver hybrid configuration (2DD+4BA) is a highly advanced technical implementation in this price range. The frequency division design, where two DDs handle the low and mid frequencies and four BAs cover the highs, is rational. Furthermore, the precise 3D-printed cavity and the 4-stage adjustment switch system, which enables multiple sound profiles, require sophisticated electronic and acoustic engineering. The ability to combine industry-standard components to deliver multifunctionality at a low price is commendable. However, these technologies are applications of existing designs rather than groundbreaking approaches that redefine industry performance. While there is a significant investment in technical components, it does not translate to improved measurement performance, limiting the score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The CCA Rhapsody sells for approximately 45 USD. At the time of this review, there are no cheaper products on the market offering equivalent features (a hybrid configuration with 6 or more drivers and a physical tuning switch). While highly-rated budget products like the 7Hz Salnotes Zero 2 (approx. 25 USD) or the TRUTHEAR HOLA (approx. 20 USD) exist, they are single-DD configurations and are not direct competitors in terms of the multi-driver setup and tuning functions offered by the Rhapsody. Since a product with equivalent or superior features important to the user is not available at a lower price, this product effectively achieves the lowest price in its category, earning a full score for cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As the sister brand of the KZ Group, which has over a decade of experience in the budget IEM market, CCA has an established manufacturing base and market reputation. The build quality is good for the price, with no major issues reported. It is available through a global sales network and comes with a standard product warranty. However, the comprehensiveness of its support system and long-term reliability data are still limited compared to established Western manufacturers. While industry-average reliability can be expected, users seeking top-tier support should be cautious. As this product does not require firmware updates, evaluation of software support is not applicable.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The direction of using a hybrid design that leverages the physical characteristics of different drivers and providing tuning options for user preference is rational. However, the design philosophy of this product raises questions. The multi-driver configuration does not necessarily lead to better measurement performance; the high THD and irregular frequency response of this product are prime examples that a higher component count does not always contribute to higher fidelity. Considering that other products achieve flatter response and lower distortion with fewer drivers, a design that seems to prioritize increasing the driver count for its own sake is not optimal from a scientific rationality perspective. It offers practical features but compromises on fundamental acoustic performance.

## Advice

The CCA Rhapsody is a niche product for users who want to experience a "multi-driver configuration" and "sound tuning features" on an extremely tight budget. Its cost-performance in this specific regard is unparalleled, as no other product offers the same features at this price point. However, a purchase requires careful consideration. Its scientific measurement performance is poor, and it is not recommended for users who prioritize fidelity to the source. The significant irregularities in frequency response and high distortion make it unsuitable for critical listening. On the other hand, for hobbyists who enjoy actively changing the sound with switches or are fascinated by the complexity of IEM internals, it could be a uniquely compelling choice.
