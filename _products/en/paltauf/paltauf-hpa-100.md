## Overview

The Paltauf HPA-100 is a hybrid tube/MOSFET headphone amplifier manufactured by Austrian company Paltauf & Stiegler GmbH. Priced at 4384 USD, this amplifier features tube-based signal voltage amplification combined with complementary lateral MOSFET output stages. Founded by Wolfgang Paltauf with over 30 years of audio experience, the company emphasizes handcrafted construction and subjective "musical experience" over measurement-based engineering. The HPA-100 provides multiple analog inputs and high power output capability across various impedance loads.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient credible measurement data. Manufacturer specifications include frequency response of 10Hz (-1.5dB) to 100kHz and power output ratings across impedance ranges (20W @ 32Ω, 35W @ 15Ω, 70W @ 8Ω), but critical measurement data such as THD+N, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, and crosstalk are not available from independent sources [1]. The frequency response specification lacks detail within the critical 20Hz-20kHz range. When credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack detailed audio-quality-relevant information, the score is set to 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The HPA-100 represents competent but not innovative engineering, relying on mature hybrid tube/MOSFET topology without significant technological advancement [1]. While featuring in-house design and over 30 years of company experience, the hybrid tube design represents mature rather than cutting-edge technology. The purely analog/mechanical approach lacks digital/software integration, and the hybrid tube design is easily replicable with no significant technical barriers. High-quality components include 1% and 0.1% precision resistors with elaborate power supply and voltage stabilizers, but these represent standard engineering practices rather than proprietary innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The HPA-100's 20W @ 32Ω power output is exceptionally high for headphone applications, as most headphones require less than 1W for optimal performance. The primary comparison target is the Benchmark HPA4 at 3499 USD [5], which delivers 6W @ 16Ω (approximately 3W @ 32Ω) with superior measured performance including THD below 0.00006% and over 140dB dynamic range. While the HPA4 provides significantly lower power output, it offers equivalent functionality with balanced/unbalanced inputs and superior measured performance for typical headphone loads. The power difference becomes relevant only for extremely demanding loads like the original HiFiMAN Susvara (83dB sensitivity, 60Ω), where the HPA-100's exceptional power capability provides a specialized advantage. CP = 3499 USD ÷ 4384 USD = 0.8. This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The HPA-100 offers standard 2-year warranty coverage typical for the industry. Construction features hybrid tube/MOSFET design with moderate complexity, where tubes require eventual replacement as consumable components. Support infrastructure is limited due to Paltauf being a small Austrian manufacturer with restricted global support presence [3]. Repair response relies on manufacturer-based support through email contact, with no publicly available reliability data or failure statistics. The boutique nature of the manufacturer reduces confidence in long-term support availability compared to larger audio companies with established global service networks.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy emphasizes subjective and nostalgic approaches rather than scientific measurement-based improvement, contrary to rational audio engineering principles. The vacuum tube approach is based on subjectivity and "natural warm sound" claims lacking scientific rationality [4]. Majority of costs relate to boutique construction and tube components rather than measurable performance improvement. Claims of audible tube "warmth" effects lack scientific validation, while expensive handmade construction and tube-rolling capability represent cost investment unrelated to measured performance. The conservative approach relies on nostalgic tube technology rather than scientific advancement, with tube technology being inferior to modern solid-state implementations for measurable performance.

## Advice

The Paltauf HPA-100 occupies a specialized niche as one of the few dedicated headphone amplifiers capable of delivering 20W @ 32Ω and 70W @ 8Ω, making it suitable for extremely difficult loads like the original HiFiMAN Susvara or similar power-hungry planar magnetics. However, most headphones perform optimally with much lower power levels, making the HPA-100's exceptional power capability relevant only for specific applications. At 4384 USD, buyers are paying for boutique Austrian construction, tube-rolling capabilities, and specialized high-power specifications, though alternatives like the Benchmark HPA4 at 3499 USD offer superior measured performance for typical headphone loads. Consider this amplifier primarily if you own exceptionally difficult headphones requiring power levels beyond typical amplifiers, but carefully evaluate whether the power premium justifies the cost for your specific headphone requirements.
