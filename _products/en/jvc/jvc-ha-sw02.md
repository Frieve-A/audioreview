## Overview

The JVC HA-SW02 (WOOD 02) represents JVC's wood dome technology in over-ear headphone form, featuring 40mm wood dome diaphragms and natural wood housing construction. Part of JVC's WOOD series that has been developing wood fiber diaphragm technology since 2008, the HA-SW02 incorporates high-energy magnetic circuitry exceeding 1 Tesla and detachable cable connectivity. Priced at approximately 340 USD, this model positions itself as a premium offering emphasizing natural materials and traditional analog construction approaches.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity assessment is not possible due to insufficient measurement data availability. The manufacturer specifications include 8Hz–45kHz response, 56Ω impedance, 105dB/1mW sensitivity, and 1,500mW maximum input [1]. However, these values are manufacturer-published specifications, and detailed measurement conditions (such as -3dB points, THD, S/N ratio) are not publicly available. Measurement data from audio-sound is included in paid content, and objective measurement values (THD, frequency response deviation, S/N ratio, etc.) available for free review are limited [2]. Due to insufficient publicly available measurement data, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 (unable to evaluate).

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

JVC demonstrates significant technical expertise in proprietary wood dome diaphragm development, with accumulated know-how in large-diameter wood dome implementation and natural wood housing construction [1]. The high-energy magnetic circuit achieving over 1 Tesla magnetic flux density represents advanced driver engineering [1]. In-house design and development capabilities with patent technology adoption contribute to technical sophistication. However, the approach remains purely analog/mechanical without integration of modern digital signal processing, measurement-based tuning, or computer-aided optimization that characterizes cutting-edge audio technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The HA-SW02's primary functions include over-ear closed-back design, detachable cable connectivity, and basic passive headphone functionality. Manufacturer-published specifications indicate 8Hz–45kHz frequency response, 56Ω impedance, and 105dB/1mW sensitivity [1]. As the cheapest product with equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance, the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x provides equivalent-or-better user-facing functionality at 99 USD [3]. The ATH-M40x features over-ear closed-back design, detachable cable connectivity, and basic passive headphone functionality, with manufacturer-published specifications indicating 15Hz–24,000Hz frequency response, 35Ω impedance, and 98dB sensitivity [3]. While the HA-SW02's 8Hz–45kHz frequency response range is wider, both products provide equivalent coverage within the practical audible range (approximately 20Hz–20kHz), and the ATH-M40x offers equivalent-or-better measured performance with measurement-verified professional monitoring capability through flat frequency response tuning.

CP = 99 USD ÷ 340 USD = 0.29

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

JVC provides standard 1-year warranty coverage with global support infrastructure through official channels [4]. The natural wood construction demonstrates adequate but not exceptional durability expectations. User reports indicate potential comfort limitations requiring specific positioning preferences, with some experiencing initial harshness requiring extended burn-in periods [4]. Third-party replacement ear pad availability suggests common wear patterns for consumable components. Standard manufacturer support systems and warranty coverage align with industry averages without exceptional extended coverage or specialized support services.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

JVC's design philosophy emphasizes subjective qualities and "natural sound" through wood diaphragm materials without providing measurement evidence or blind testing validation [1]. The premium cost allocation appears directed toward wood materials rather than measurable performance improvements. Claims regarding wood diaphragm benefits lack ABX testing or controlled measurement verification. The conservative analog-only approach excludes modern measurement-based tuning, digital signal processing, or objective optimization techniques. This approach contradicts scientific audio engineering principles that prioritize measured performance over material-based aesthetic preferences.

## Advice

For users seeking objective sound quality improvements, consider measurement-verified alternatives such as the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x at 99 USD, providing equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance at significantly lower cost. The 340 USD premium for wood construction provides no demonstrated audible benefits over well-engineered conventional materials. Prospective buyers valuing aesthetic wood appearance over measurable performance may find appeal, but should understand the cost allocation primarily serves visual rather than acoustic objectives. Those requiring proven professional monitoring capability should prioritize products with documented frequency response measurements and neutral tuning validation.
