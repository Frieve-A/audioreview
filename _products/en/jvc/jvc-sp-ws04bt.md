## Overview

The JVC SP-WS04BT is a portable wireless speaker distinguished by its natural wood texture design. It employs a 2-way speaker system with 20W total output, featuring a front woofer, left and right silk dome tweeters, and dual passive radiators at the rear to achieve stereo sound. With IP67-grade waterproof and dustproof performance, it offers practical reliability for use in water environments such as bathrooms. Bluetooth 5.0 wireless connectivity enables up to 15 hours of continuous playback, providing basic performance suitable for daily use.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific audio quality assessment is difficult due to the lack of published detailed measurement data including frequency response and THD (Total Harmonic Distortion). The 20W output and 2-way configuration represent standard levels for compact portable speakers, but achievement of transparent levels according to measurement result criteria cannot be verified. The adoption of wooden enclosures may affect acoustic resonance characteristics, but specific improvement effects remain unclear. The sealed nature required for IP67 waterproof specifications may impact low-frequency characteristics, but this is also difficult to evaluate without measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This represents a conventional design combining basic 2-way speaker configuration with added passive radiators, showing no particular technological innovation. While the use of natural wood materials serves as a differentiation factor, its technical advantages directly contributing to acoustic performance improvement are limited. The adoption of Bluetooth 5.0 is at standard levels, with no confirmation of proprietary digital signal processing technology or advanced driver technology implementation. The waterproofing technology at IP67 level is also industry standard, offering no notable technical advantages.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against the current price of 20,592 yen, the Anker Soundcore Select 2S (6,990 yen) exists with equivalent or superior functionality. The Select 2S provides 20W output, IPX7 waterproofing, 16-hour playback, and BassUp technology, actually offering superior specifications. Calculation: 6,990 yen รท 20,592 yen = 0.339, indicating that equivalent or superior performance can be obtained at approximately one-third the price. While the natural wood design adds value, no measurable acoustic performance advantages can be confirmed to justify the price difference.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JVC is an audio equipment manufacturer with a long history in Japan, offering support systems above industry average levels. Product warranty periods and repair support also provide the reassurance expected from a domestic manufacturer. However, the portable speaker field includes many emerging manufacturers, so JVC does not possess overwhelming unique advantages. While specific data on product failure rates and long-term reliability are not published, quality above industry average can be expected based on the company's past track record.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The practical improvement through IP67 waterproof specifications represents a rational approach. The adoption of natural wood design is understandable as a differentiation strategy, but its scientific contribution to acoustic performance is limited. The combination of 2-way configuration with passive radiators is a common approach for compact speakers, offering no particular innovation. The 15-hour battery life is practical but not noteworthy compared to competing products. Overall, this represents a conservative design philosophy that reliably provides basic functionality, with no groundbreaking audio quality improvements or disruptive pricing approaches evident.

## Advice

The JVC SP-WS04BT is a suitable choice for users who find appeal in natural wood design and value brand trust. The IP67 waterproof performance provides confidence for bathroom use, and 15-hour extended playback is sufficient for daily use. However, when prioritizing pure audio quality and cost-performance, alternatives like the Anker Soundcore Select 2S offer equivalent or superior performance at approximately one-third the price. Careful consideration is recommended regarding whether the wooden design justifies the premium over 20,000 yen, or whether trust in the JVC brand provides value worth the price difference. For those prioritizing audio quality above all, higher-performance options may exist in the same price range.
