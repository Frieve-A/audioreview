summary: "Refined tribrid IEM with advanced IMPACT² subwoofer implementation and studio-leaning tuning; however, against the cheapest equivalents with comparable measured performance, cost-performance is poor."

## Overview

The ThieAudio Oracle MKIII is the 2024 refresh of the Oracle line. This 589 USD tribrid (2DD + 2BA + 2EST) adds the brand’s IMPACT² dual-dynamic isobaric “subwoofer” module and a four-way crossover aimed at a neutral-with-bass boost monitor presentation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

- **Third-party FR evidence:** Headphones.com measured Oracle MKIII on a B&K Type 5128 (Type 4620 ear simulator) and shows a **neutral base with elevated sub-bass** (≈ **+10 dB at 20 Hz** vs midrange), within modern preference bounds; the review explicitly documents the rig and calibration and discusses the bass behavior in listening.  
- **Manufacturer specs (verifiable):** **Impedance 13 Ω (±1 Ω), sensitivity 99 dB (±1 dB) @1 kHz, FR 20 Hz–44 kHz, four-way crossover, modular 2-pin cable with 2.5/3.5/4.4 mm plugs.**  
- **Technology description:** IMPACT² is a **dual 10 mm isobaric** arrangement intended to increase sub-bass output and texture without upsetting system pressure.  
- **Gaps/limits:** Public, lab-grade THD/IMD/crosstalk data for Oracle MKIII remain scarce; isolation in dB is not published. With solid FR evidence but limited distortion/linearity data, the score remains **0.7** (borderline transparent on the evidence available).

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Isobaric dual-DD “subwoofer” integration (IMPACT²), tribrid driver stack (2DD/2BA/2EST), and modular terminations are well-executed, but most building blocks are established. Strong engineering, not a category breakthrough.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Per policy, we compare against the **cheapest product that offers equivalent user-facing function and equal-or-better measured performance** (not limited by brand or driver topology).

- **Comparator:** **TRUTHEAR HEXA** (1DD+3BA).  
  - **Price (street, US):** **89.99 USD.**  
  - **Measured performance:** Rtings shows a **balanced response closely matching their target** with **FR consistency σ ≈ 0.48 dB** and **no audible harmonic-distortion coloration at typical levels**; passive isolation is rated **very good** for mid/treble bands. Manufacturer specs list THD ≤ 1% @1 kHz (94 dB). This satisfies the “equal-or-better measured performance” requirement for a passive wired IEM used as a monitor.  
- **CP calculation:** **89.99 USD ÷ 589 USD = 0.15 ⇒ score 0.2.**  
- **Conclusion:** Oracle MKIII’s function and measured results can be met by a far cheaper IEM; cost-performance is **poor** by construction.

*(Why HEXA qualifies: same **wired passive IEM** function; independent lab FR/consistency/isolation evidence; no materially worse measured traits versus Oracle MKIII in the commonly evaluated domains.)*

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ThieAudio states a **1-year warranty** for IEMs (3 months cable). Passive, non-DSP design and modular cable help serviceability, but a 1-year term is **average/short** versus some peers, and global support is largely retailer-mediated. Score adjusted to **0.6**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The tuning targets neutrality with bass lift and the IMPACT² module addresses sub-bass output via a real acoustic solution. However, the **premium pricing** is not justified by **commensurate measured gains** over far cheaper options with demonstrably competent FR and low distortion.

## Advice

Buy Oracle MKIII if you specifically want a **tribrid with an isobaric dual-DD sub-bass emphasis** in a premium shell and modular cable. If you prioritize **measured accuracy per dollar**, **TRUTHEAR HEXA (89.99 USD)** delivers equivalent core outcomes at a fraction of the price; even stepping up, **Moondrop Blessing 3 (~319 USD)** provides strong, well-documented FR behavior for less.
