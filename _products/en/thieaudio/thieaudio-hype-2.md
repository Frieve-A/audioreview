## Overview

The ThieAudio Hype 2 is a hybrid in-ear monitor featuring a 2DD+2BA configuration priced at 299 USD. Equipped with ThieAudio's IMPACT² technology, it utilizes dual 10 mm composite-diaphragm drivers in an isobaric chamber alongside two Sonion balanced armature drivers (P2356HF/4 and E25ST001/D). The earphones use a 3D-resin shell with custom-colored faceplates (Purple / Blue). Manufacturer specs: frequency response 20 Hz–40 kHz, sensitivity 108 dB SPL/mW, impedance 25 Ω. The Hype 2 targets listeners seeking a balanced, musical presentation in the sub-300 USD hybrid IEM market. [2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Third-party frequency-response data shows a mild V-shape with bass elevation extending into lower mids and upper-treble unevenness, producing roughly ±4 dB class deviations across the audible band relative to neutral targets, which exceeds transparent criteria for headphones/earphones. [1] Manufacturer specs indicate adequate bass extension and treble reach, but independent harmonic-distortion data is limited; available measurements do not demonstrate superior transparency versus well-measuring budget IEMs. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The IMPACT² isobaric dual-dynamic system and the use of current-generation Sonion units (P2356HF/4, E25ST001/D) reflect a competent, contemporary engineering approach. 3D-printed resin shells and a four-driver crossover are executed to a modern standard, but the design remains evolutionary rather than transformative, with no clear measured gains over simpler architectures. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

At 299 USD, the Hype 2 is undercut by cheaper products that match or exceed its user-facing functions and measured performance.

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **Moondrop Chu II** at **22.99 USD**. It is a passive, wired IEM with detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin connector and comparable accessory set; independent measurements show a response that tracks common neutral targets more closely than Hype 2 and low distortion for the category. [3][4][5]  
**Equivalence note (minimal requirement):** *Detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin wired IEM; frequency-response deviation and THD are equivalent-or-better.* [3][4][5]

**CP calculation (policy formula):**  
CP = 22.99 USD ÷ 299 USD = **0.1** (rounded to one decimal).

(For context, the 7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2 at 24.99 USD also meets the equivalence condition but is not the cheapest. [6])

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

ThieAudio provides a basic 1-year warranty via retailers (e.g., Linsoul). Build quality aligns with typical resin-shell IEMs using standard 2-pin connectors, aiding serviceability via cable replacement. Direct global support infrastructure is limited compared to larger brands, and there are occasional pre-order/stock gaps that can affect turnaround on exchanges. No firmware path exists for a purely passive design. [2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While the isobaric dual-DD concept is interesting, available third-party data does not evidence audible transparency advantages versus simpler single-DD designs. The chosen tuning favors a market-friendly, mildly V-shaped presentation over strict neutrality. The component choices are sensible, but the product strategy positions Hype 2 against objectively strong, vastly cheaper competitors without delivering commensurate measured improvements. [1][2]

## Advice

Consider Hype 2 if you prefer a mild V-shape with weighty bass and like its styling and build. If your priority is measurement-driven neutrality and value, **Moondrop Chu II (22.99 USD)** or **7Hz Zero:2 (24.99 USD)** offer equal-or-better measured transparency at a fraction of the price. If you want a more technically ambitious hybrid and accept the higher cost, **Moondrop Blessing 3** remains a well-measuring step up, though still far above the cheapest transparent options.
