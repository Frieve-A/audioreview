## Overview

The ThieAudio Hype 4 is a 6-driver hybrid in-ear monitor using an isobaric dual 10 mm dynamic bass module (IMPACT²) plus four Sonion balanced armatures. It targets a sub-bass-boosted neutral tuning and portable, wired use with a detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable. Street price is 399 USD via authorized retailers at launch in 2024. Key published specs include 17 Ω impedance and 105 dB (±1 dB) sensitivity at 1 kHz [1]. Our evaluation focuses on third-party measurements first, with manufacturer data used only where independent data are limited.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent frequency-response (FR) sets for the Hype 4 on IEC-60318-4 rigs generally show a sub-bass lift with broadly neutral mids and a modest upper-treble presence—consistent with ThieAudio’s stated target (manufacturer FR narrative) [1]. Full, standardized distortion datasets remain scarce; therefore, claims such as “lower harmonic distortion” from specific Sonion units are treated as provisional until verified. Published electrical specs are 17 Ω and 105 dB (±1 dB) @1 kHz (manufacturer) [1]. As a sanity check for equivalence during CP selection (below), we relied on RTINGS’ Test Bench 2.0 measurements for comparator IEMs to anchor FR accuracy, group delay, and isolation on a consistent protocol [2][3]. Given partial gaps for Hype 4 (e.g., comprehensive third-party THD), 0.7 is appropriate.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

IMPACT² (isobaric dual-DD) is a sensible engineering approach to increase low-frequency output while controlling excursion-related distortion. The use of current-generation Sonion BAs and a multi-way acoustic/crossover layout reflects contemporary, competent implementation rather than category-redefining innovation. Integration quality appears high for the price tier, but the approach is evolutionary rather than disruptive [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better): TRUTHEAR HEXA (1DD+3BA), 89.99 USD.**  
Equivalence basis: wired IEM with detachable cable and third-party-verified **balanced FR with minimal peaks/dips**, **solid stereo matching/group delay**, and **strong passive isolation in mid/treble bands** per RTINGS (Test Bench 2.0). HEXA shows FR consistency σ≈**0.48 dB**, “balanced (0 dB) bass amount,” and “balanced (−1 dB) treble amount”; RTINGS also notes no audible coloration from harmonic distortion at typical levels and impressive passive isolation (protocol details on the page) [2]. Using the defined formula:

**CP = 89.99 USD ÷ 399 USD = 0.23 → score 0.2.**

Reference note: Blessing 3 (319.99 USD) remains a well-known 2DD+4BA alternative with extremely balanced FR but is **not** the cheapest equal-or-better option under our policy; therefore it is not used for CP scoring [3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Sales and warranty are primarily through authorized dealers (e.g., Linsoul). Warranty is listed as 1 year on IEMs; long-term field-failure data remain limited given brand recency. The 6-driver architecture adds complexity versus single-DD designs, but no widespread failure trends are documented [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product direction emphasizes measurable acoustic outcomes (targeted FR, bass headroom) rather than non-scientific claims. Cost is allocated to transducer topology and reputable BA units in ways that plausibly affect measurable results. Premium over cheaper peers exists but is tied to understandable engineering choices more than pure cosmetics [1].

## Advice

If you want a sub-bass-weighted neutral tuning with good technical competence and prefer a 2-pin wired IEM, Hype 4 is coherent and enjoyable. However, from a **value** perspective, TRUTHEAR HEXA achieves comparable measured fidelity and isolation at a far lower price and is the better buy for most measurement-first shoppers [2]. If you specifically prefer hybrid 2DD+4BA execution and a slightly different treble character, Moondrop Blessing 3 remains a credible **alternative** at ~320 USD (not the CP basis) [3].
