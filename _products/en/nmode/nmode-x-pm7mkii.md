## Overview

The nMode X PM7 MKII is a Japanese integrated amplifier that converts all incoming analog signals to DSD for amplification via a proprietary 1-bit stage. It provides 3×RCA and 2×XLR inputs, 32W×2 into 4Ω and 20W×2 into 8Ω, published THD of 0.005% (1kHz, 1W), and an external BNC “super clock” input with selectable sampling frequencies. Street price in Japan commonly sits at 287,820円 (≈1,920 USD), with a listed MSRP of 330,000円. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are **no credible third-party bench measurements** of the X PM7 MKII to confirm performance across the audible band. Manufacturer specs quote FR 5Hz–90kHz, THD 0.005% at 1kHz/1W, and power 20W/8Ω and 32W/4Ω, but omit SNR, crosstalk, dynamic range, and wide-band THD+N at realistic output levels. Without independent data versus audibility-relevant thresholds (e.g., THD+N ≤0.01% across 20Hz–20kHz and SNR ≥105dB), audible transparency remains unverified. The 1-bit/DSD scheme itself is not evidence of audible improvement. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The product demonstrates **non-commodity design**: a bespoke 1-bit amplifier stage, thin-film polymer multilayer capacitors, balanced I/O, and an external word-clock input with multiple frequency options—indicating genuine engineering investment. Still, the approach leverages mature delta-sigma concepts rather than breaking new ground, and there is **no demonstrated performance advantage** over modern Class D or linear amps that already achieve excellent transparency. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better)**: **Yamaha A-S301**—an integrated amplifier with higher continuous power (60W/8Ω), built-in DAC (optical/coax), phono input, SNR 99dB, damping factor 210, remote control, and broad retail availability. These **user-facing functions** and **published performance** are equivalent-or-better for typical use. US price **379.95 USD**. [4][5]

**CP calculation** (must show simple division):

379.95 USD ÷ 1,920 USD = **0.198** → **0.2** (rounded to one decimal).

Result: markedly low value versus cheaper integrateds with documented performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

nMode (Lyric Corp.) maintains a domestic repair center and publishes service logistics, which is positive. However, the **support footprint is Japan-centric**, and international warranty/parts pathways are not clearly documented. In the absence of third-party failure-rate data, reliability is judged near average but with **limited global support** weighing it down. [9]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Routing all analog inputs through a 1-bit/DSD conversion and exposing a consumer **external word-clock** interface adds complexity and cost **without third-party evidence of audible benefit**. The feature set prioritizes esoteric clocking options over measured, listener-relevant improvements (e.g., lower wide-band THD+N, higher SNR). This direction is **weakly rational** from a transparency-first perspective. [1]

## Advice

If you seek transparent, hassle-free power, the **Yamaha A-S301** offers higher output, more connectivity (including digital and phono), and a much lower price. For a step-up integrated with balanced input and larger power reserves, consider **Cambridge Audio CXA81 MkII**; third-party measurements show competent performance and substantially greater headroom. The previously suggested NAD C 328 remains a capable option with verified lab data (≈50W/8Ω measured), but its current street price has risen, reducing its value proposition relative to cheaper competitors.
