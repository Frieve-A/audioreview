## Overview

Arc Ultra pairs **14 drivers** with **15 Class-D amps**, HDMI eARC, Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6, and Trueplay for both iOS and Android[1]. Sonos markets a **9.1.4-like** spatial experience from a single bar. US MSRP is **999 USD** (JP direct price **149,800円**), announced **Oct 15, 2024** with availability from **Oct 29, 2024**[2][3].  

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent data (RTINGS) reports **stereo max ~93.0 dB SPL**, **center max ~95.3 dB SPL**, **weighted THD (center) ~0.63% @80 dB / ~1.90% max**, **stereo low-frequency extension ~46.9 Hz**, and **stereo standard error ~2.50 dB**[4]. These indicate solid linearity and dialog clarity for a single-bar system; height perception is room-dependent but can be convincing within favorable acoustics[4][6].  

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The **Sound Motion** flat woofer (four motors, dual membrane) increases bass output without added bulk, while seven tweeters (two up-firing) and six mid-woofers are each driven by dedicated amplification[1]. Features include **Speech Enhancement (four levels)**, **Trueplay for iOS/Android**, **AirPlay 2**, **Bluetooth 5.3**. Connectivity is **HDMI eARC/ARC only**—**no HDMI passthrough**—and DTS Digital Surround is listed with a decoder note, not a licensed logo[1].  

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As an equal-or-better alternative at a **lower street price**, we select **Samsung HW-Q800D** (5.1.2 with bundled wireless sub, HDMI input with **4K/60 passthrough**, 7-band EQ)[5]. Typical US pricing is **799 USD** vs **999 USD** for Arc Ultra[1][5].  
**CP = 799 USD ÷ 999 USD = 0.8.**  

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sonos’ long update cycle and cohesive ecosystem are strengths, but the **May 2024 app overhaul** shipped with regressions and missing features, prompting a public apology and a published improvement roadmap[7]. Stability has improved since, yet the recent history warrants a slightly conservative score.  

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Prioritizing a single-bar immersive experience and adopting the Sound Motion concept is sensible. However, **no HDMI passthrough** and **no included sub** at this price reduce practicality versus rivals with richer I/O and bundled bass performance[1][5].  

## Advice

- Choose **Arc Ultra** if you value a clean, single-bar setup and tight Sonos integration[1].  
- Prefer **Samsung HW-Q800D (799 USD)** if you want stronger bass out of the box and HDMI passthrough[5].  
- If you go with Arc Ultra, adding **Sub 4 (109,800円)** significantly boosts cinematic impact[8].
