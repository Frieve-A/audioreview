summary: "Compact Dolby Atmos soundbar with Trueplay room correction and a faster processor; solid measured fidelity for its size but limited loudness and no real height drivers. Cost-performance recalculated against the cheapest equal-or-better rival."

## Overview

The Sonos Beam (Gen 2) is a compact Atmos-capable soundbar with Trueplay room correction and a 40% faster chip versus Gen 1 for enhanced virtual surround processing. Dimensions are 25.63 × 2.68 × 3.94 in and 6.35 lb, targeting small to mid-sized rooms and TVs of 43" and up [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent measurements show: Stereo low-frequency extension 50.4 Hz and high-frequency extension 16.7 kHz; SPL @ Max Volume 88.8 dB SPL (stereo); Center channel weighted THD 0.63 at 80 dB and 1.54 at max; Atmos (height) is phantom via front drivers with SPL 59.2 dB SPL [2]. The bar lacks up-firing drivers; height cues rely on DSP virtualization rather than discrete elevation channels [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Beam Gen 2 employs a 40% faster processor for spatial processing, Trueplay room correction using iOS device microphones, and a 5-driver array (one center tweeter, four elliptical mid-woofers) plus three passive radiators, each on Class-D amps. Supported formats include Dolby Atmos (via eARC) and DTS Digital Surround. Sonos documents Trueplay’s spectral correction approach in detail [1][4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 499 USD (review target price), the cheapest product with **equal-or-better functions and measured performance** we could identify is the **Bose Smart Soundbar 600** at 499 USD: it adds real up-firing drivers and measures higher SPL @ Max Volume (93.0 dB SPL vs 88.8) and stronger center performance in RTINGS’ framework [2][3].  
**Calculation:** 499 USD ÷ 499 USD = **1.00** → 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sonos announced a manufacturer warranty extension in 2024 amid app issues, reflecting acknowledgement and support focus [5]. Hardware uses a simple Class-D architecture with few moving parts, but software dependency introduces potential risks. Global support and continuing firmware/app updates are in place [1][5].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Pursuing compact form with DSP-based Atmos and room correction is a rational, data-driven path for small bars. However, without physical height drivers, the approach has inherent limits versus systems with real elevation channels. The ecosystem/streaming integration is modern and coherent, but not unique relative to rivals [1][2][4].

## Advice

Choose Beam Gen 2 if you value compact size, seamless Sonos multi-room, and straightforward setup, and you watch at moderate volumes. If you want stronger height effects at similar cost, **Bose Smart Soundbar 600** is the equal-price alternative with up-firing drivers and higher measured max SPL [3]. For more output and bass (not a like-for-like single-bar comparison), consider bundles with a sub and surrounds.
