## Overview

The Sonos Sub Mini is a compact wireless subwoofer designed specifically for integration within the Sonos ecosystem. Measuring 23 x 30.5 cm in a cylindrical design and weighing 6.35 kg, it uses dual 6-inch woofers in a force-canceling configuration with Class D amplification in a sealed cabinet. Sub Mini supports Trueplay room tuning (supported iOS device required) and the manufacturer specifies extension as low as 25 Hz. Priced at 429 USD, it offers a lower-cost path to add bass to Sonos bars and speakers while preserving fully wireless, app-integrated operation [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

There is no credible third-party measurement dataset published for Sub Mini as a standalone subwoofer as of the review date. Manufacturer specifications indicate frequency response “as low as 25 Hz,” dual 6-inch force-canceling woofers, Class D amplification, and sealed cabinet construction [1]. However, no tolerance window (e.g., −3 dB/−6 dB), maximum SPL vs frequency, or THD curves are provided. The compact enclosure and small driver area (2 × 6 in) imply output limits below larger subs of similar design. Given the absence of independently verified frequency response linearity and distortion metrics (e.g., 20–200 Hz ±dB, THD at 31.5/40/63 Hz), scientific certainty is limited. Starting from 0.5 for unknown measurements per site policy and adjusting for known physical constraints and lack of tolerance/THD data yields 0.4.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sub Mini implements a sensible set of technologies for its role: force-canceling dual woofers to reduce cabinet vibration, sealed loading, efficient Class D amplification, and system-level DSP including Trueplay tuning [1][2]. Wireless integration and app-based EQ are robust. Constraints stem from the compact form factor and moderate amplifier/driver scale relative to higher-output subs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price for Sub Mini is 429 USD (official store) [1]. To be equivalent from a user perspective, a comparator must deliver full Sonos wireless integration (pairing and control in the Sonos app) with equal-or-better subwoofer function. Within the Sonos ecosystem, the next option is Sub (Gen 3) at 799 USD [3]. There is no cheaper product that provides equal-or-better Sonos-integrated subwoofer functionality. Therefore, by policy definition, Sub Mini is the cheapest equivalent option and Cost-Performance is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sonos provides a mature support and firmware update pipeline and a standardized app experience. Wireless connectivity reduces cabling issues, and the force-canceling layout mitigates enclosure vibration stress. Trueplay allows periodic re-optimization [2]. A key risk factor is ecosystem dependency: long-term usability is tied to Sonos platform continuity since there are no standard analog inputs.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product trades flexibility and absolute output potential for seamless ecosystem integration. Exclusive Sonos compatibility and the lack of standard audio inputs limit system upgrade paths and cross-platform use. The compact sealed design is rational for domestic integration but imposes output constraints versus larger enclosures. These choices are coherent for convenience but reduce scientific optimality compared with traditional, measurement-focused subwoofers.

## Advice

Sub Mini is recommended primarily for existing Sonos users who need unobtrusive bass addition to Beam, Ray, or small Sonos speakers with full wireless control. If maximum low-frequency output and measured transparency are priorities, consider traditional subs with standard inputs and room EQ (accepting extra cabling and setup). Within Sonos systems where wireless integration is non-negotiable, Sub Mini is the lowest-cost entry.
