## Overview

The Sonos Sub 4 is the latest generation of the company’s flagship wireless subwoofer. It employs dual 5" x 8" elliptical woofers in a force‑canceling configuration, a ported cabinet, and claims frequency response as low as 25 Hz [1]. Within the Sonos ecosystem, it pairs wirelessly with supported soundbars and speakers and offers Trueplay room correction [1]. Sonos indicates updated internal electronics with a faster processor, more memory, and a new Wi‑Fi 6 radio versus the prior model [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent third‑party measurements specific to Sub 4 are not yet published as of the review date. Manufacturer specifications claim extension as low as 25 Hz [1]. For context, Sound & Vision’s ground‑plane measurements of the previous Sonos Sub generation reported 34–96 Hz (±3 dB) frequency response and CEA‑2010 output of 99.0 dB at 31.5 Hz, 110.9 dB at 40 Hz, 114.8 dB at 50 Hz, and 114.9 dB at 63 Hz, with no measurable output below 31.5 Hz [3]. The force‑canceling dual‑driver architecture aims to reduce enclosure vibration, but without current independent distortion and maximum output data for Sub 4, audible transparency cannot be confirmed. Score is provisionally centered at 0.5 pending third‑party data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Sub 4’s design centers on a conventional ported alignment with force‑canceling dual elliptical woofers and ecosystem wireless pairing. The addition of a faster processor, more memory, and Wi‑Fi 6 improves platform capability but represents incremental evolution rather than breakthrough acoustics [1]. Trueplay room correction and app EQ are mainstream features across the category. Overall technical posture is competent but not industry‑leading in measured acoustic advancement absent third‑party verification.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current US price for Sub 4 is 799 USD [1]. To be equivalent‑or‑better from the user perspective, a comparator must provide native wireless pairing within the Sonos ecosystem and equal‑or‑better measured performance. No cheaper current product meets these conditions; Sub (Gen 3) lists at 799 USD and Sub Mini at 429 USD is not equal‑or‑better in performance class despite an identical “as low as 25 Hz” catalog claim [2]. Therefore, no cheaper equivalent‑or‑better option exists at this time, and CP is set to 1.0 per site policy.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sonos maintains industry-standard reliability with established service infrastructure and regular firmware updates. The Sub 4 includes a standard warranty period consistent with consumer electronics. Sonos has demonstrated ongoing software support for previous generation products, though the company has faced criticism for discontinuing support for older models. The Wi-Fi 6 upgrade suggests forward-looking connectivity, though reliability of the new processor and memory configuration remains unproven given the recent release date. Support documentation and community resources are adequate, with established customer service channels, though no exceptional reliability claims or extended warranty coverage differentiate it from industry standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The approach prioritizes seamless ecosystem integration and ease of setup over absolute acoustic output per dollar, which is rational for the intended audience. Force‑canceling and platform features like Trueplay are science‑based, but closed‑ecosystem constraints limit component flexibility versus open systems. Price positioning emphasizes brand and convenience more than measurable acoustic breakthroughs, a reasonable strategy but not optimized for transparency‑first goals.

## Advice

Sub 4 suits users invested in the Sonos ecosystem who value wireless pairing, app control, and simple setup. If your priority is maximum measurable bass extension/output per dollar irrespective of ecosystem, consider waiting for independent Sub 4 measurements or choosing measured alternatives in open systems. For multi‑room wireless audio with convenient integration, Sub 4 functions effectively within Sonos constraints [1].
