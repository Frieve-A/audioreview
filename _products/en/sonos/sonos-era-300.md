summary: "A premium spatial-audio smart speaker with six drivers and Trueplay room correction. Independent tests show ~40 Hz low-frequency extension, good FR accuracy, and ~90.9 dB SPL max. While distortion data remains limited, it delivers solid objective performance. Cost-performance is tempered by the cheaper HomePod (2nd gen) offering similar user-facing features."

## Overview

Launched in 2023, the Sonos Era 300 is a Dolby Atmos–capable smart speaker built around a six-driver array (four tweeters, two woofers) powered by six Class-D amps. It supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and line-in (via adapter), and uses multi-mic beamforming with Trueplay room correction. Spatial audio playback is natively supported with Apple Music and Amazon Music. The speaker integrates tightly with the Sonos multiroom ecosystem and can serve as surrounds with Sonos soundbars. [1][2][5][6]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Third-party measurements report a low-frequency extension (LFE) of 40.6 Hz, maximum output of 90.9 dB SPL, and FR standard error of 1.93 dB (with room correction), indicating competent bass reach, output, and response linearity for the class [1]. Another source observes generally flat response to ~40 Hz and a useful 60–100 Hz EQ boost [2]. Public THD/IMD datasets remain limited for this model, so despite strong FR metrics, the incomplete distortion picture keeps the score at 0.6. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Era 300 combines a directional horn-loaded up-firing tweeter, custom waveguides, and coordinated DSP with Trueplay auto-tuning. Connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, and AirPlay 2, with voice control via Sonos Voice Control/Alexa. It’s a sophisticated, modern implementation of spatial playback, though publicly documented step-change advances in distortion performance are scarce. [6]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

US price is 449 USD [6]. Apple’s HomePod (2nd gen) at 299 USD offers an equivalent user feature set (spatial audio with Atmos, room correction, smart features) and comparable measured performance: deeper LFE at 32.7 Hz but lower max SPL; overall, it qualifies as an equivalent alternative for CP purposes [3][4].  
**Computation**: 299 USD ÷ 449 USD = 0.666… → 0.7.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sonos has a strong record of long-term software updates across generations. Warranty terms vary by region (explicitly stated by Sonos), and there was a time-limited global 1-year extension campaign for certain purchases in 2023–2024 [8][9]. Considering regional variance yet solid update cadence, we assign 0.8.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The product emphasizes measurable improvements—controlled directivity, DSP-based room EQ, and standardized Atmos music playback—which is a rational route to audible gains. A current practical limitation is service coverage: Atmos music is supported with Apple Music and Amazon Music but not natively with Tidal via the Sonos app as of this writing [5]. Overall, the approach remains evidence-oriented and user-beneficial.

## Advice

If you’re invested in the Sonos ecosystem or mainly stream spatial audio from Apple Music or Amazon Music, the Era 300 is a compelling one-box solution. It reaches ~90.9 dB SPL and, with Trueplay enabled, achieves tight FR conformity in typical rooms [1]. If you want similar functionality for less, Apple’s HomePod (2nd gen, 299 USD) is a credible alternative with deeper LFE at 32.7 Hz, provided you’re comfortable with Apple’s ecosystem [3][4]. Those prioritizing Tidal Atmos should note the app-level limitation on Sonos at present [5].
