## Overview

The Audix OM5 is a professional hypercardioid dynamic vocal microphone designed for live sound, broadcast, and studio applications. Engineered with Audix's proprietary VLM (Very Low Mass) diaphragm technology, the OM5 provides crisp vocal reproduction with exceptional transient response and superior gain-before-feedback performance. With a 50 Hz to 18 kHz frequency response and maximum SPL handling of ≥144 dB, this microphone targets professional vocalists and sound engineers requiring reliable performance in demanding environments. Designed, assembled, and tested in the USA, the OM5 represents Audix's four-decade commitment to innovative microphone technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The OM5 demonstrates excellent maximum SPL performance at ≥144 dB, significantly exceeding the transparent level threshold of 140 dB for microphones [1][2]. Third-party measurements confirm sensitivity of 2mV/Pa at 1kHz, slightly exceeding manufacturer specification of 1.6mV/Pa [2]. The frequency response of 50 Hz to 18 kHz provides reasonable coverage, with detailed frequency response characteristics showing low-frequency roll-off below 120Hz to balance proximity effect, slight hump in 100-200 Hz region for voice weight, and wide presence plateau from 3kHz to 12kHz adding 6dB lift for vocal clarity [2]. Off-axis rejection measures 30dB, providing good directional isolation [2]. The hypercardioid polar pattern maintains tight, uniform characteristics with minimal rear pickup and deep nulls at ±150°, though pattern narrows above 4kHz [2]. While S/N ratio and equivalent noise level specifications remain unavailable, substantial third-party measurement data confirms performance approaching transparent levels across multiple critical parameters.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The OM5 incorporates Audix's proprietary VLM (Very Low Mass) diaphragm technology, representing genuine technical innovation that provides measurable benefits in transient response and frequency extension. This low-mass diaphragm design enables the upper frequency response to extend higher than typically expected from dynamic microphones, while maintaining the reliability advantages of dynamic construction. The in-house design and manufacturing in Wilsonville, Oregon demonstrates technical ownership and accumulated expertise over Audix's 40+ year history since 1984. The VLM technology represents desirable innovation that other manufacturers would consider adopting. However, the technology remains purely analog/mechanical without integration of modern digital processing or software capabilities.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The OM5's current market price is 199 USD. The Sennheiser E945 was identified as the cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative at 113 USD [5]. Equipped with supercardioid polar pattern providing similar directional characteristics, frequency response of 40-18,000 Hz (wider than OM5's 50 Hz-18 kHz), sensitivity of 2 mV/Pa, and 10-year warranty period [5]. The E945 provides equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance characteristics including superior frequency response coverage and longer warranty period. CP = 113 USD ÷ 199 USD = 0.6. While the OM5 offers solid VLM technology and US manufacturing quality, more affordable alternatives provide equivalent or superior measured performance characteristics at significantly lower cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The OM5 receives exceptional marks for reliability and support. Dynamic microphones feature simple, robust construction inherently resistant to failure, with few moving parts and solid mechanical design. Audix provides a comprehensive 5-year warranty for VLM Dynamic microphones, significantly exceeding the industry standard 2-year warranty period. The company maintains US-based manufacturing with global support infrastructure, including dedicated return authorization system with 24-hour response commitment during business days. Established in 1984, Audix demonstrates over 40 years of track record and accumulated reliability experience. The warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship with repair or replacement at company discretion.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Audix demonstrates highly rational design philosophy focused on measurable performance improvements. The company's stated mission "to design, engineer, and manufacture high performing, innovative products that contribute to the advancement of the professional audio industry" aligns with performance-focused rational approach. The VLM diaphragm technology provides genuine technical benefits that contribute to measurable performance improvements in transient response and frequency extension, with costs directly contributing to functional advancement rather than marketing purposes. The focus on dedicated microphone equipment for professional applications demonstrates appropriate functional integration. Innovation through proprietary technology development shows progressive attitude toward advancing audio technology. The emphasis on US manufacturing and quality control processes supports consistent performance delivery.

## Advice

The OM5 suits professional vocalists and sound engineers requiring reliable hypercardioid dynamic microphone performance with excellent maximum SPL handling and detailed frequency response characteristics. The 5-year warranty and proven VLM technology make it appropriate for long-term professional use in live sound, broadcast, and studio environments. However, potential buyers should consider the more affordable Sennheiser E945 which provides equivalent or superior performance at significantly lower cost (113 USD vs 199 USD). The E945 offers wider frequency response (40-18,000 Hz), equivalent sensitivity (2 mV/Pa), and extended 10-year warranty period. For budget-conscious users requiring professional dynamic microphone performance, the E945 offers substantially better value proposition. Choose the OM5 primarily when US manufacturing origin, VLM technology heritage, specific frequency response characteristics with presence plateau, or Audix ecosystem integration provides meaningful advantage for your specific applications.
