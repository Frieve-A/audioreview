## Overview

The RHA CL750 represents a traditional audiophile approach to in-ear headphone design, featuring a high 150-ohm impedance specifically optimized for amplifier use. Released by the Glasgow-based company in 2016, this model showcased RHA's proprietary CL dynamic transducer technology within precision-engineered stainless steel housings. The product aimed to deliver high-resolution audio reproduction up to 45kHz while maintaining the company's signature build quality standards. However, the CL750 has since been discontinued following RHA's acquisition by Sonos in 2021.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurements are available from In-Ear Fidelity, showing mild V-shaped tuning with peaks between 2–4 kHz in the upper midrange and around 10–12 kHz in the upper treble [1]. The 150-ohm impedance and 89 dB/mW sensitivity create practical limitations, requiring dedicated amplification for optimal performance. The 89 dB/mW sensitivity falls below the excellent level for headphones (100 dB+) according to measurement criteria. However, available measurements indicate reasonable frequency response linearity within the audible range, though the high-impedance design provides no measurable advantage over modern low-impedance alternatives while creating compatibility constraints.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The CL750 employs mature dynamic driver technology without significant innovation. RHA's proprietary CL dynamic transducer features a precision voice coil array, annular magnet, and 9µm-thin diaphragm, representing competent but conventional engineering. The 150-ohm impedance design contradicts industry trends toward portable device compatibility, and the analog-only approach lacks integration of modern technologies like DSP or wireless capabilities. While the stainless steel construction demonstrates quality manufacturing, the overall technology level reflects 2016-era approaches without cutting-edge advancement or significant competitive differentiation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

At 139.95 USD, the CL750 faces competition from cheaper equivalents. The cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator is the Etymotic ER2SE at 99.95 USD [3][4]. The ER2SE offers excellent passive isolation (approximately 35–42 dB) and practical sensitivity/impedance for portable devices, and third-party measurements confirm good frequency response linearity. This site evaluates solely by functions and measured values, not driver types. CP = 99.95 ÷ 139.95 = 0.7.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Despite originally offering a robust 3-year international warranty and durable stainless steel construction, reliability concerns center on corporate instability. RHA Technologies faced financial difficulties leading to acquisition by Sonos in October 2021. The CL750 is discontinued and no longer manufactured, creating uncertainty around parts availability and repair services. While the physical construction suggests good durability, the corporate changes and product discontinuation severely compromise long-term support prospects for existing users.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The CL750's design philosophy reflects traditional audiophile priorities that conflict with rational audio development principles. The 150-ohm impedance design limits compatibility with portable devices without providing measurable benefits over lower impedance alternatives. The approach prioritizes conventional materials and construction over functional integration or modern technological advancement. The product line's discontinuation suggests the philosophy was not commercially viable, and the lack of progression toward measurement-focused improvements indicates limited rationality in development direction.

## Advice

The RHA CL750 appeals primarily to users with dedicated amplification seeking traditional audiophile construction quality. However, potential buyers should consider the significant limitations: discontinued status, uncertain support, and practical incompatibility with portable devices. The high impedance design offers no measurable advantage over modern low-impedance alternatives while creating amplification dependency. Given these factors, most users would benefit more from current-generation IEMs with better compatibility, ongoing support, and equivalent or superior measured performance.
