## Overview

The RHA MA750 is a single dynamic driver in-ear monitor from Glasgow-based RHA Audio, featuring handmade 560.1 dynamic drivers housed in machined stainless steel enclosures. Certified by the Japan Audio Society for Hi-Res Audio compliance, the MA750 represents RHA's emphasis on premium materials and traditional craftsmanship. The product includes comprehensive accessories, premium oxygen-free copper cable, and RHA's signature Aerophonic housing design. Originally launched at 119 USD MSRP, the MA750 competed in the mid-tier IEM market before being discontinued.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurements are available from Reference Audio Analyzer and Crinacle providing frequency response graphs, impedance (18.6Ω measured vs 16Ω specified), and sensitivity data (128.0 dB SPL measured vs 100 dB specified). However, critical specifications for comprehensive sound quality evaluation are missing: no THD measurements, no S/N ratio data, no quantified frequency response deviation values, and no crosstalk measurements. The available sensitivity measurements show excellent performance above the 105 dB transparent level. Manufacturer specifications indicate 16-40,000 Hz frequency response per Hi-Res Audio certification by Japan Audio Society, though some sources list 16-22,000 Hz. Without key distortion and noise performance data, comprehensive scientific validity assessment cannot be performed. Given insufficient measurement data for proper evaluation per framework requirements, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The MA750 employs conventional single dynamic driver technology with 560.1 drivers featuring neodymium magnets and RHA's proprietary Aerophonic housing design. Construction utilizes machined stainless steel (303F grade) components with oxygen-free copper cable and reinforced 3.5mm connection. While the in-house design and premium materials demonstrate craftsmanship, the technology represents mature dynamic driver implementation without significant innovation. The analog-only approach lacks modern features like DSP integration or advanced connectivity options. Despite solid engineering execution, the overall technology level remains standard for its era with limited competitive differentiation beyond materials and build quality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

This evaluation is based solely on functions and numerical performance data. Driver types and configurations are completely excluded from consideration. The MA750 is a wired passive IEM without DSP or wireless functions. Third-party data confirms measured sensitivity above the 105 dB transparent level and available frequency response measurements [1][2]. As an equivalent-or-better comparator strictly by user-facing functions and measured performance availability, the Moondrop Chu provides the same functional set (wired passive IEM) and has third-party measured frequency response available [2]. Using current typical market pricing for the comparator [4] and the review target price A = 119 USD:

CP = 19.99 USD ÷ 119 USD = 0.168 → 0.2.

Therefore, cost-performance is 0.2. If a cheaper product with equal-or-better user-facing functions and confirmed measured performance is identified, this section will be updated accordingly.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

RHA provides comprehensive 3-year warranty with excellent customer service response documented by users. Replacement processing typically occurs within 24-48 hours with quick delivery. The stainless steel construction provides inherent durability and robust design resistant to degradation. However, user reports document recurring issues including cable failures at connection points, jack assembly vulnerability to bending, and some individual driver failures. Despite global manufacturer support infrastructure and premium materials, documented reliability issues with cable design and connections prevent higher scoring. The warranty support system appears effective for addressing these issues when they occur.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

RHA emphasizes premium materials and traditional craftsmanship over measurement-driven design optimization. The focus on stainless steel construction and artisanal elements represents conservative audio approach rather than scientific performance advancement. Design philosophy prioritizes perceived quality and durability through material investment rather than cost-effective performance delivery. The analog-only approach lacks integration of modern technologies like DSP or advanced connectivity that could enhance functionality. While the build quality focus demonstrates attention to construction, the philosophy shows limited scientific measurement emphasis and conservative innovation attitude compared to performance-optimized alternatives.

## Advice

The RHA MA750 appeals to users prioritizing premium build quality and materials over pure performance metrics. The stainless steel construction and comprehensive warranty provide long-term ownership confidence, while the traditional dynamic driver design delivers familiar sound characteristics. However, modern alternatives like the Truthear Hexa offer superior measured performance and functionality at lower cost. Consider the MA750 only if premium materials and brand heritage outweigh performance-to-price considerations, or if seeking a robust IEM with extensive warranty coverage. For performance-focused purchases, current market alternatives provide better value.
