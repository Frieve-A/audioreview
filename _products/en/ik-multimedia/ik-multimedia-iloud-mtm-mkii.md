## Overview

The IK Multimedia iLoud MTM MKII is a compact active studio monitor featuring an advanced ARC (Automatic Room Correction) system. Its MTM (Midwoofer-Tweeter-Midwoofer) configuration includes two 3.5-inch woofers and a 1-inch tweeter, driven by a 100W Class-D bi-amp system. By doubling the DSP processing power of its predecessor and adopting more efficient drivers, it achieves professional studio monitoring performance in a small footprint. The included ARC measurement microphone automatically performs room correction via a 4-point measurement system, and the X-MONITOR software provides emulation of other famous monitor brands.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The nominal frequency response is 48Hz-28kHz (±2dB), with a maximum SPL reaching 112.5dB. Independent measurements confirm that the frequency response, especially after ARC correction, becomes exceptionally flat to the target curve, indicating high scientific validity. It also demonstrates a good directivity pattern in CEA/CTA-2034 compliant measurements. The ARC system provides scientific room correction based on actual acoustic measurements, and its improvements are clearly audible. However, the manufacturer does not publish detailed acoustic performance data such as THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) or SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), which limits an objective evaluation of its sonic transparency. While its performance is excellent for a compact monitor, the lack of data disclosure prevents a perfect score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The inclusion of advanced ARC technology inherited from the flagship iLoud Precision series, which enables a comprehensive room analysis system via 4-point measurement, is technologically advanced. Originality and rationality are found in its digital signal processing technologies, such as achieving a point-source-like behavior and controlled directivity with the MTM configuration, optimizing phase response, incorporating a DSP with double the processing power of the previous model, and the X-MONITOR emulation feature. The Class-D bi-amp design also effectively balances efficiency and performance. On the other hand, the driver technology itself is an application of existing technologies, with innovation concentrated in the DSP section. Overall, it achieves a modern and practical technology level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The market price for a pair of iLoud MTM MKII is approximately 799.99 USD. A comparable alternative is a pair of Yamaha HS5 monitors (approx. 450 USD) combined with Sonarworks SoundID Reference with a measurement microphone (approx. 299 USD), for a total of about 749 USD. The calculation is `749 USD ÷ 799.99 USD = 0.936...`. Rounding this as per the policy gives a score of 0.9. This indicates very high cost-performance, as the price is only marginally different from a functionally equivalent alternative setup, especially when considering the convenience of a fully integrated hardware and software solution.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

IK Multimedia is an established company with a long history in audio software and hardware, providing standard support systems. The product comes with a standard warranty. However, the iLoud MTM MKII is a new product released in 2024, and due to its reliance on DSP functions, its long-term failure rate and firmware stability are not yet proven. Based on the review policy, new products with unknown long-term reliability are rated at the industry average. No significant reliability issues have been reported, but for now, the rating remains average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The adoption of the ARC system, which automatically corrects the sound field based on measurements, is an extremely rational approach that eliminates subjectivity. The design philosophy of achieving comprehensive room analysis through 4-point measurement, objective emulation of other manufacturers' products via X-MONITOR, and balancing compactness with high performance is perfectly suited to modern production environments, especially those with limited space and acoustic treatment. The MTM configuration for directivity control is also acoustically sound. There are no unscientific claims or occult elements; the development policy consistently emphasizes measurement data and practicality, which is highly commendable. The fact that it is an integrated, dedicated device also provides convenience and stability that cannot be matched by a combination of a general-purpose PC and software, making its existence rational.

## Advice

This product is strongly recommended for users who want to build an accurate monitoring environment in a space- and acoustically-constrained setting, such as a home or project studio. The ARC auto-calibration system is immensely beneficial, especially in untreated rooms. It offers a one-stop solution for a process that traditionally required multiple steps: "monitor selection," "room acoustic treatment," and "measurement and correction." When purchasing, basic knowledge of speaker placement, such as symmetrical positioning, is necessary to maximize the effects of ARC. For those who already have a larger main monitoring system, it serves as a very effective objective secondary reference.
