price: 599.99
summary: "A compact 3-inch monitor pair with ARC auto-calibration and 50 W RMS per speaker. Manufacturer specs indicate 50 Hz–20 kHz ±2 dB and 94 dB continuous / 107.3 dB peak at 1 m (ANSI-2034). Cheaper equal-or-better alternatives limit value."

## Overview

The iLoud Micro Monitor Pro is a digitally controlled 2-way near-field monitor featuring a 3″ woofer, 1″ silk-dome tweeter, **50 W RMS per speaker** (30 W LF + 20 W HF) Class-D bi-amp, linear-phase crossover, built-in ARC self-calibration, and X-MONITOR integration. The **Pair** includes the ARC MEMS microphone; connectivity covers balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA[1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer data show **50 Hz–20 kHz ±2 dB** (42 Hz–22 kHz @ −10 dB) and **94 dB continuous / 107.3 dB peak SPL** at 1 m (free-field, ANSI-2034 weighted pink noise)[1]. ARC auto-calibration and X-MONITOR provide measurement-guided correction and visualization[1][2]. Lacking broad third-party distortion datasets, this remains a provisional spec-based score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The platform combines linear-phase crossover, time alignment, DSP EQ, MEMS-based auto-calibration, and computer control via X-MONITOR[1][2]. Solid and modern execution without being a category-defining leap.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Street price (Pair)**: iLoud Micro Monitor Pro **599.99 USD**[3].  
**Cheapest equal-or-better alternative**: **KRK Rokit 5 Generation Five** (**199 USD each → Pair 398 USD**). It offers user-facing room-tuning with **25 DSP EQ combinations**, balanced inputs, and wider bandwidth; for monitoring tasks it qualifies as **equal-or-better** in functionality/measurement scope[5].  
**CP (USD)**: **398 ÷ 599.99 = 0.66 → 0.7** (1-decimal rounding).  
(Reference domestic price example: Pair **96,800円**[4].)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Retail hardware carries a **2-year limited warranty**[6]. Firmware and diagnostics are delivered via X-MONITOR / Product Manager[2]. With limited long-term field data, neutrality at 0.5 is appropriate.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design focuses on **measurable transparency enablers** (linear-phase processing, auto-calibration, and response visualization) consistent with the published specifications[1][2]. Further independent measurements would refine this appraisal.

## Advice

Pick this pair if you need **compact placement plus automated calibration**. If you prioritize **wider bandwidth/output at lower cost** and accept preset-based tuning, **KRK Rokit 5 Gen 5 (Pair 398 USD)** is the value choice[5].
