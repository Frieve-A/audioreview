## Overview

IK Multimedia iLoud Precision is a series of active studio monitors developed by the Italian pro audio manufacturer. Established in 1996, IK Multimedia is known for software like AmpliTube and T-RackS, and this product incorporates their DSP technology into hardware. The series includes 5-inch, 6.5-inch, and MTM models. The built-in DSP, operating at 96kHz, achieves a linear phase response, and the proprietary ARC technology with the included microphone automatically corrects room acoustics. Manufactured by hand in Italy and calibrated individually, it guarantees a strict inter-unit consistency of ±0.5dB.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The nominal specification of ±1dB from 46Hz to 30kHz is an excellent performance that approaches the 'transparent' level in our measurement criteria table. The linear phase response, achieved through DSP control, provides an ideal impulse response, especially above 150Hz, contributing to accurate sound imaging. The built-in ARC room correction function effectively reduces frequency response irregularities caused by the installation environment, enabling reliable monitoring in many real-world use cases. The Total Harmonic Distortion is also kept at a sufficiently low level for a speaker, making it a product with high scientific validity overall.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The integration of signal processing, crossover, and room correction entirely in the digital domain via a 96kHz DSP is technologically advanced. It is particularly noteworthy that a linear phase response is achieved in a speaker at this price point. The ARC room correction system is a proprietary technology combining automatic measurement with the included MEMS microphone and a correction algorithm cultivated over many years of research. Furthermore, the X-MONITOR software, which allows emulation of the frequency and phase characteristics of other famous monitors, demonstrates its technological originality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The street price for a pair of iLoud Precision 5s, approximately 1,170 USD, represents phenomenal cost-performance considering its functionality. We compare it with competing products that offer both core features: a DSP-based linear phase response and automatic room correction. For instance, a setup using a pair of Genelec's "8330A" with the necessary "GLM Kit" for room correction costs a total of approximately 1,920 USD. Similarly, a configuration of a pair of Neumann's "KH 120 II" with the "MA 1" measurement microphone totals around 1,980 USD. The iLoud Precision 5 provides equivalent or superior features at a significantly lower price, making it the world's most affordable option in this category. Therefore, the score is a perfect 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Established in 1996, IK Multimedia is a company with over 25 years of experience in the pro audio software industry. They have also established a reputation in hardware manufacturing with the iLoud series. In Japan, the warranty period is extended to two years, providing support that exceeds industry standards. The manual assembly in Italy and pre-shipment calibration for every unit ensure initial product quality and minimal unit-to-unit variation. While not a newcomer, its long-term durability record in the speaker category is still limited compared to other long-established brands, so the score is 0.7.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The approach of emphasizing measurable performance, particularly frequency and time-domain response (phase characteristics), and fully utilizing DSP technology to control them is extremely rational. Furthermore, the integration of an automatic room correction function as a standard feature to address the unavoidable issue of "room acoustics," not just the speaker's standalone performance, is highly commendable. The product's clear raison d'être and rational design philosophy are evident in its delivery of these advanced technologies—once available only in far more expensive products—integrated into hardware at this price.

## Advice

The iLoud Precision 5 is highly recommended for any user looking to build an accurate monitoring environment. If you prioritize a linear phase response and a flat frequency response independent of the installation environment, it is difficult to find a better option in this price range. It achieves advanced features, which traditionally required an investment of nearly 2,000 USD, with overwhelming cost-performance. For creators working in typical home studios or rooms with acoustic challenges, this product's ARC system will be a powerful tool. It is truly an ideal choice for users who do not want to compromise on sound quality, even with a limited budget.
