## Overview

The Mackie MP-240 is a professional in-ear monitor featuring a hybrid dual-driver design with one dynamic driver and one balanced armature driver. Released as part of Mackie's MP series, it targets musicians, engineers, and audio professionals seeking detailed monitoring capabilities. The MP-240 utilizes a custom crossover that splits frequencies between the two drivers, with the dynamic driver handling low frequencies and the balanced armature driver managing mids and highs for enhanced clarity and instrument separation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications list a 20 Hz–20 kHz bandwidth, **impedance 32 Ω ±15%**, and **sensitivity 94 dB ±3 dB @ 1 mW, 1 kHz**; driver topology is a single dynamic + single balanced armature (Knowles) with detachable MMCX cabling and bundled tips. Some third-party listings report different impedance/sensitivity values, so the official documentation is treated as authoritative. No independent lab measurements (e.g., full-band FR deviation, THD, crosstalk on standardized fixtures) were found for MP-240. The series documentation and product page emphasize stage use with high passive isolation, but the claimed isolation is not backed by external lab data. In the absence of credible third-party measurements, the scientific basis remains limited to catalog specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The MP-240 employs a conventional hybrid dual-driver approach with dynamic and balanced armature drivers connected via a passive crossover. This represents standard industry practice rather than innovative technology. The detachable MMCX cable system and multiple ear tip options demonstrate adequate engineering but nothing exceptional. The over-ear cable routing with memory wires is a common professional design element. While the hybrid driver configuration is more sophisticated than single-driver designs, similar technology is widely available from numerous manufacturers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

At **199 USD**, a lower-cost alternative with **equal or better functional parity** (detachable cable, pro use, high isolation) **and published lab measurements** is the **Etymotic ER2SE** (official price **149.99 USD**, deep-insertion passive isolation **35–42 dB**, neutral-target tuning; independent FR measurements on B&K 5128 available). Given comparable or superior isolation and verified, measurement-driven tuning on ER2SE, MP-240’s cost-performance is evaluated at **0.8** relative to that cheaper, non-inferior option.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Mackie provides a **limited product warranty**; the **specific duration is defined on Mackie’s website and/or by regional distributors** and is not stated as a fixed term in the MP-series manual. The simple dual-driver construction with a passive crossover minimizes potential failure points versus more complex multi-way designs, and the detachable MMCX cable allows easy replacement if damaged. Long-term failure-rate data for MP-240 is not published. The included hard case aids transport protection, and support is available via Mackie’s global dealer network.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The MP-240 demonstrates rational design principles focused on professional monitoring applications. The hybrid driver approach dedicates specific drivers to appropriate frequency ranges. The inclusion of multiple ear tip options acknowledges the importance of proper fit for consistent response. The detachable cable system provides practical benefits for professional use. The over-ear routing and memory wire design follows established best practices for stage monitoring applications.

## Advice

For professional musicians and audio engineers seeking detailed in-ear monitors with strong passive isolation and pro-friendly features (detachable MMCX, over-ear fit, case), the MP-240 is a competent hybrid option. However, the **Etymotic ER2SE** delivers **measured, neutral-leaning performance** and deep-insertion isolation at a **lower price (149.99 USD)**, making it a compelling value for monitoring if its fit style suits you. Consider MP-240 when you prefer Mackie’s tuning, accessory set, or brand ecosystem; otherwise ER2SE offers a measurement-verified alternative at lower cost.
