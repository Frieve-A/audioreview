## Overview

The Mackie MC-100 is an entry-level closed-back studio headphone from Mackie, a US audio equipment manufacturer established in 1988. Equipped with 40mm custom drivers, it features basic specifications including a 15Hz-20kHz frequency range, 32Ω impedance, and 95dB sensitivity. With a weight of 233g, a 3m cable, and an included 1/4-inch adapter, the design is oriented toward studio applications. However, as a product in the approximately 35 USD price range, it is limited to providing basic monitoring functions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Key measurement data for objectively evaluating audio quality, such as THD+N, IMD, and precise frequency response deviation, has not been disclosed by the manufacturer for the MC-100. While the nominal specifications cover a basic range, there is a lack of scientific evidence to demonstrate its fidelity to the master source. As it cannot be objectively determined whether the performance is superior or inferior, the rating is an average score of 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The MC-100 employs a standard 40mm dynamic driver configuration with no apparent technical uniqueness or advancement. While described as having "custom-designed" drivers, no specific technical specifications or design features demonstrating their superiority are disclosed, suggesting that standard OEM drivers are likely used. Basic specifications such as 32Ω impedance and 95dB sensitivity are within industry norms, and no notable technical innovations for improving measurement performance are evident. The product is evaluated as having a below-average technical level for the industry.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Against the MC-100's actual price of approximately 35 USD, a competitive product with equivalent functionality, the TASCAM TH-02, is available for about 25 USD. The TH-02 is also a closed-back monitoring headphone with comparable basic specifications and performance. The cost-performance calculation is 25 USD ÷ 35 USD ≈ 0.71, which is rounded to 0.7. While the pricing is standard for entry-level monitoring headphones, the existence of a less expensive alternative means it does not achieve groundbreaking cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Mackie, established in 1988, is a veteran audio manufacturer with basic warranty and technical support systems in place. The official website provides warranty information, a service center locator, and FAQ sections, ensuring an industry-standard level of support. However, specific long-term reliability data or RMA rates for the MC-100 are not available. While not as concerning as a product from an emerging manufacturer, it does not offer the premium support of high-end products, resulting in an average reliability score of 0.5.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The MC-100 adopts a closed-back design intended for studio monitoring applications, which is a fundamentally rational concept. Practical considerations are evident, including versatility through its 32Ω impedance, a 3m long cable, and an included 1/4-inch adapter. However, there are no technical approaches aimed at achieving transparent levels of measurement performance. The design remains conservatively within the bounds of conventional studio headphone specifications. No scientific audio quality improvements or innovative approaches are observed, placing the product's design philosophy within industry standards.

## Advice

The MC-100 is an entry-level product providing basic studio monitoring functions in the approximately 35 USD price range. While unsuitable for serious audio production or precision monitoring, it can be a practical choice for basic applications like personal content creation or podcast recording. However, with direct competitors like the TASCAM TH-02 (approximately 25 USD) available at a lower price, there is little compelling reason to choose the MC-100 specifically. For those with a larger budget, investing in a higher-tier model such as the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x is recommended.
