## Overview

The Mackie MRS10 is a 10-inch powered studio subwoofer from the MR Series designed to provide extended low-frequency response for studio monitoring applications. Features a 10-inch glass aramid composite woofer powered by 120W Class-AB amplification with frequency response from 35 Hz to 180 Hz and maximum SPL of 119 dB. Includes adjustable crossover from 40 to 180 Hz, polarity switch, and both XLR and TRS connectivity for integration with existing monitor systems.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Based on available manufacturer specifications, the MRS10 demonstrates adequate measured performance for its category. Frequency response extends from 35 Hz to 180 Hz (-3dB), providing reasonable low-frequency extension for a 10-inch subwoofer. S/N ratio >90 dB exceeds the 80 dB threshold for speakers and approaches the excellent level of 105 dB. Maximum SPL of 119 dB provides sufficient output capability for studio applications. While THD, dynamic range, and crosstalk specifications are not published, the documented specifications indicate performance between standard and transparent levels for powered subwoofers. The frequency response range and output capability meet typical studio monitoring requirements without reaching exceptional performance levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The MRS10 employs conventional Class-AB amplification and glass-aramid composite driver technology representing standard industry practice rather than technological advancement. While functionally adequate, it demonstrates no significant proprietary innovations, patent technology, or technical leadership that would distinguish it from competitors. The design uses contemporary but not cutting-edge technology with appropriate analog/digital combination but appears to be competitive OEM design without significant technical differentiation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Equipped with 10-inch powered subwoofer delivering 120W Class-AB amplification, frequency response 35 Hz - 180 Hz, adjustable crossover 40-180 Hz, maximum SPL 119 dB, S/N ratio >90 dB, and XLR/TRS connectivity. The JBL LSR310S provides equivalent-or-better performance with significantly more amplifier power (200W vs 120W) and deeper bass extension (27 Hz vs 35 Hz).

Current market price: 450 USD. CP = 399 USD รท 450 USD = 0.9.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Mackie provides comprehensive support infrastructure including multiple authorized service centers globally, parts availability through dedicated channels (parts@mackie.com), and established warranty service network with over 15 years of service experience. The company maintains global support system by manufacturer with established repair centers. However, specific warranty period details and failure rate data were not available for complete evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Mackie's design philosophy emphasizes "simple, rugged design and affordable pricing" with their stated goal to "do an A/B comparison with an analogue desk and not be able to tell the difference." While this measurement-focused approach demonstrates scientific rationality, the MRS10 represents conservative implementation using conventional Class-AB amplification without meaningful technological advancement. The design lacks integration of modern technologies like DSP, advanced port designs, or measurement-based optimization that could improve performance or reduce costs. The product maintains traditional analog approaches without leveraging current engineering capabilities that competitors employ to achieve superior measured performance at similar price points.

## Advice

The MRS10 offers competitive cost-performance in the 10-inch powered studio subwoofer category. The JBL LSR310S provides superior amplifier power (200W vs 120W) and deeper bass extension (27 Hz vs 35 Hz) at a slightly lower price point (399 USD vs 450 USD). The MRS10 is particularly suitable for integration with existing Mackie MR Series monitor systems and offers higher maximum SPL (119 dB vs 113 dB) when required for larger studio spaces.
