## Overview

The Lo-D HS-10000 is a custom-made, ultra-high-end speaker system released in 1978 by Lo-D, the audio brand of Hitachi. Priced at 1.8 million JPY per unit, which was exceptionally expensive even at the time, it was a large system featuring five planar drivers and one passive radiator. Positioned as the culmination of Lo-D's top-tier technology, it was developed as the pinnacle of their planar driver expertise. At the time, it was acclaimed as a pioneering product that established the concept of a reference speaker.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

While it may have been excellent by the technological standards of 1978, its scientific validity is extremely low when compared to modern measurement benchmarks. With the speaker technology of that era, maintaining a frequency response within ±3dB was difficult, and distortion levels are presumed to be problematic by today's standards. Although the use of planar drivers offered a certain technological advantage, its performance falls far short of the transparent level achieved by modern high-performance speakers, such as a frequency response of ±1dB or less and THD below 0.1%. The phase alignment and directivity control of its multiple drivers are also significantly inferior to modern designs, meaning no meaningful improvement in sound quality can be expected from an auditory perspective.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

For 1978, it was an ambitious design incorporating five advanced planar drivers. The use of a flat diaphragm filled with foam resin was original for its time and a rational approach aimed at eliminating the cavity effect, a drawback of cone-type drivers. However, when evaluated from the standpoint of modern technology, the driver materials, magnetic circuit design, and enclosure technology are all obsolete. Compared to modern advancements like diamond tweeters, beryllium diaphragms, FEA-optimized designs, and DSP correction technology, its technology level is substantially inferior.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The 1978 price of 1.8 million JPY is equivalent to about 5.4 million JPY today. However, equivalent or superior sound quality can be achieved with modern speakers for under 100,000 JPY. For instance, modern entry-level models like the Elac Debut B6.2 (around 50,000 JPY per pair) show far superior measurement performance. Based on this comparison, the calculation is 50,000 JPY ÷ 5,400,000 JPY = 0.009, indicating a catastrophically poor cost-performance. In a pure performance-to-price ratio that completely excludes vintage value, it has no competitiveness against modern alternatives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Forty-seven years have passed since its manufacture, and manufacturer support has completely ended. Since the Lo-D brand itself was discontinued in the 1980s, obtaining genuine parts is impossible. The aging of the planar drivers is unavoidable, and performance degradation due to the deterioration of the foam resin and demagnetization of the magnetic circuits is expected. Technicians capable of repairing them are extremely limited, making repairs virtually impossible in case of failure. There is no reason to consider purchasing it as a current product.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

While its concept of a "reference speaker" was advanced for its time, many aspects appear irrational from a modern scientific viewpoint. The complex configuration using five drivers is disadvantageous for phase alignment and directivity control; modern coaxial or time-aligned designs are more rational. Furthermore, its necessity as a dedicated audio device is weak, as equivalent or better performance can be achieved at a lower cost with modern general-purpose active speakers and DSP correction. The design philosophy, which prioritized subjective sound creation over improving measured performance, lacks rationality from the perspective of scientific sound quality improvement.

## Advice

For those considering the purchase of a Lo-D HS-10000, I strongly recommend reconsidering. Unless you are seeking it for its antique value as vintage audio, you should choose a modern speaker if sound quality is your priority. With a budget of 5.4 million JPY, you could purchase modern flagship models like the KEF Reference 5 Meta (around 3 million JPY per pair) or the B&W 802 D4 (around 4 million JPY per pair), which are overwhelmingly superior in both measured performance and sound quality. For a smaller budget, even the KEF R3 Meta (around 200,000 JPY per pair) offers performance that far exceeds the HS-10000. Nostalgia for past products is a pitfall in audio investment; the wise choice is to embrace the benefits of modern technology based on scientific evidence.
