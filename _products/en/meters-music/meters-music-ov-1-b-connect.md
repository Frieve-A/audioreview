## Overview

Meters Music OV-1-B-Connect are wireless ANC headphones featuring a distinctive real-time VU meter display [1]. Developed by Ashdown Engineering, a company with approximately 29 years of amplifier design experience for major artists including U2, Foo Fighters, and Black Sabbath (founded 1997) [6], these headphones incorporate patented VU meter technology that reacts to sound levels [1]. The headphones feature Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX HD codec support, active noise cancelling with 82% background noise reduction (manufacturer specification), and 5-band parametric EQ via the Meters Connect app [1][2]. Weight is 380g with battery life specifications varying by source: 16 hours continuous (official product page) versus 10-12 hours (Head-Fi testing), and both wireless and 3.5mm wired connectivity options [1][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. Only basic manufacturer specifications are available (frequency response range 20Hz-20kHz, sensitivity 94dB/mW, impedance 32 Ohms) [1][2], with no credible third-party measurements from RTings, Audio Science Review, or similar sources. Critical audio quality indicators including THD, SNR, frequency response deviation from Harman target curve, and passive isolation performance are not publicly available. ANC performance is provided as manufacturer specification of 82% background noise reduction [1][2], but this percentage format cannot be directly converted to the dB scale required for proper evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Good technology level achieved through proprietary patent technology and in-house design expertise. The headphones feature patented VU meter design requiring three years of development, representing unique real-time visual feedback technology (+0.1) [1]. In-house design by Ashdown Engineering leverages approximately 29 years of professional audio experience from bass amplifier development for major recording artists (founded 1997) (+0.1) [6]. Technology integration includes appropriate contemporary components: Qualcomm QCC5124 system-on-chip enabling 24-bit Bluetooth audio, aptX HD codec support, Class AB amplification, and 5-band parametric EQ via dedicated app (±0) [1][2]. While the VU meter implementation provides meaningful differentiation, the underlying audio technology uses standard current solutions without cutting-edge advancement beyond industry norms.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Poor cost-performance due to availability of equivalent-or-better functionality at significantly lower prices. Current market price is 299.99 USD [1]. Comparison target: 1MORE SonoFlow at 74.99 USD provides equivalent-or-better functionality with ANC technology, and superior battery life (50-70 hours vs 10-16 hours), along with comprehensive codec support including LDAC and Hi-Res Audio certification [5]. The SonoFlow offers Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity, ANC functionality, and enhanced battery performance that exceeds the core features of the OV-1-B-Connect. Equipped with key functions including ANC and wireless connectivity, and battery life and codec support are equivalent-or-better. CP = 74.99 USD ÷ 299.99 USD = 0.3.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Below-average reliability and support due to limited warranty and basic support infrastructure. Warranty period is 1 year from purchase date, covering defects in materials and workmanship when purchased from authorized dealers [4]. Support is primarily email-based [4]. The product page states OTA (over-the-air) update support via the Meters Connect app [1]. Customer bears responsibility for return shipping costs, and warranty liability is capped at original purchase price [4]. Construction uses standard wireless headphone complexity with ANC electronics presenting typical failure points. While parent company Ashdown Engineering has approximately 29-year professional audio track record (founded 1997) [6], the newer Meters Music brand lacks established consumer reliability data [1]. Support infrastructure appears dealer-dependent rather than direct manufacturer system [4].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Mixed rationality assessment with innovative elements balanced by cost-effectiveness concerns. Design philosophy demonstrates appropriate scientific approach using contemporary digital technologies including Bluetooth 5.0, aptX HD codec, and Class AB amplification without occult or unscientific claims [1][2]. The patented VU meter represents genuine innovative visual feedback approach contributing to functional integration [1]. However, cost-effectiveness is problematic as the 299.99 USD price point appears excessive for functionality achievable at much lower cost through equivalent products [1]. The design shows good audio-specific justification with genuine ANC, driver, and amplification functionality warranting dedicated equipment status. Technology adoption is appropriate but not cutting-edge, while cost optimization appears poor given market availability of equivalent performance at significantly reduced pricing.

## Advice

Consider these headphones only if the unique VU meter visual display provides specific value for your use case and budget allows premium pricing for aesthetic differentiation [1]. For pure audio functionality including ANC, wireless connectivity, and superior battery life, equivalent-or-better options exist at 74.99 USD (1MORE SonoFlow) with enhanced specifications including Bluetooth 5.0, ANC technology, and 50-70 hour battery life [5]. Note that battery life specifications vary between sources (10-16 hours depending on testing methodology), so actual performance may differ from official claims [1][3]. The Ashdown Engineering heritage and build quality may appeal to users valuing the company's professional audio background, but this does not translate to measurable audio performance advantages [1]. Prospective buyers should evaluate whether the distinctive VU meter design justifies the significant price premium over functionally equivalent alternatives available at one-quarter the price.
