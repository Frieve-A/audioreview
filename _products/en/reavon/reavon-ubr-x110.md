## Overview

The Reavon UBR-X110 is a universal 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player supporting **UHD BD/BD/BD3D/DVD, plus DVD-Audio and SACD**. Sitting between the UBR-X100 and flagship UBR-X200, it uses the **MediaTek MTK8581 SoC** and a **1.6 mm base reinforced by a 3 mm steel plate** to reduce vibration. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a digital transport (no analog outputs), analog-domain THD/SNR are determined by the downstream DAC/AVR. Transport integrity is the key factor; while there is no published HDMI-jitter dataset specific to X110, platform-adjacent measurements on the UBR-X200 (same SoC family) show **A-weighted SNR ≈112 dB** on its analog stage and **J-Test jitter components largely below test limits**, indicating competent clocking/transport implementation at the platform level. Evidence remains indirect for X110, so we keep the default **0.5**. [4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The MTK8581 platform and full universal disc handling are mature, and the rigid chassis is sound engineering; overall the design is evolutionary rather than novel. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At **999 USD**, the X110 competes against **Sony UBP-X800M2** which is widely available at **328 USD** (B&H) and **supports both SACD and DVD-Audio** (per Sony's official manual).  
**CP = 328 ÷ 999 = 0.328 → 0.3** (rounded to 1 decimal). Functionality is not inferior for most HDMI users, so X110’s value score is low. [5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Chassis rigidity is excellent. Firmware is provided on the support site for **manual USB updates** and documentation is available via the official downloads hub; Reavon’s support footprint is smaller than tier-1 brands, moderating the score. [2][3][5]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A digital-only output strategy avoids adding player-specific analog distortion. Emphasis on mechanical rigidity to reduce vibration is appropriate for disc transports. [1]

## Advice

Choose the UBR-X110 if you want a **universal HDMI transport** with heavy chassis and on-screen technical info. If you prioritize value, **Sony UBP-X800M2** delivers equivalent disc compatibility (incl. **DVD-Audio**/**SACD**) for far less. If you need premium **analog** stages and HDR10+ with robust build, consider **Panasonic DP-UB9000**. [5][6][7]
