## Overview

The Mitchell & Johnson MJ2 represents an ambitious attempt to bring electrostatic technology to portable headphones through a hybrid electret-dynamic driver configuration. Priced at 499 USD, this closed-back headphone combines a traditional 40mm dynamic driver with an electret mid/high frequency panel driver, eliminating the need for external high-voltage power supplies typically required by electrostatic designs. The company, established in London in 2011 by Paul Mitchell and David Johnson, ceased operations in September 2019, leaving these headphones as a technological curiosity from a discontinued product line.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The MJ2's manufacturer specifications claim frequency response of 6Hz-50kHz, 32Ω impedance, 120dB SPL, and THD ≤0.1%. However, no credible third-party measurements are available to verify these claims. The stated THD ≤0.1% falls exactly at the problematic threshold according to measurement criteria (0.05% excellent, 0.5% problematic for headphones), representing the boundary between acceptable and concerning distortion levels. Without independent verification of actual measured performance, Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated and is set to 0.5 per framework guidelines for products lacking credible measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The MJ2 incorporates genuinely innovative hybrid electret-dynamic technology licensed from Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), covered by US patents 8,559,660 B2 and 10,250,966. This design successfully eliminates the traditional requirement for external high-voltage power supplies in electrostatic headphones through integrated step-up transformers. The implementation represents significant technical advancement in making electrostatic technology portable and accessible. However, the limited market adoption by other manufacturers suggests potential technology desirability issues despite the technical innovation. The cutting-edge nature of this technology and successful engineering implementation of complex hybrid driver systems demonstrates considerable technical sophistication.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At 499 USD, the MJ2's cost-performance is compromised by the availability of equivalent-or-better alternatives at significantly lower prices. The Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO (32Ω) at 169.99 USD provides equivalent closed-back design, identical impedance, superior verified measured performance, and professional-grade reliability. The DT 770 PRO offers equivalent user-facing functions with confirmed low distortion and proven build quality compared to the MJ2's unverified specifications.

CP = 169.99 USD ÷ 499 USD = 0.3

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Mitchell & Johnson's complete closure in September 2019 eliminates all manufacturer support, warranty coverage, and repair services. Amazon customer reviews report quality control issues including DOA units with channel failure and concerns about lightweight construction with thin wiring. The permanent discontinuation of manufacturer support combined with reported manufacturing defects creates significant reliability concerns for current and potential users. Third-party repair options may exist but cannot replace comprehensive manufacturer support systems.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The MJ2 represents genuine technological innovation in electret-dynamic hybrid design, with the company demonstrating scientific transparency by providing frequency response curves. However, the rationality is diminished by premium pricing without demonstrated performance advantages over conventional alternatives. The company's stated philosophy of "state of the art technology combined with classic hi-fi design at an affordable price" is contradicted by the 499 USD price point and lack of verified superior performance. The inability to sustain operations suggests fundamental market validation issues, questioning the practical viability of the approach despite its technical merit.

## Advice

The MJ2 should be approached with significant caution due to the discontinued manufacturer support and unverified performance claims. While the hybrid electret technology represents an interesting engineering achievement, potential buyers face substantial risks including lack of warranty coverage, no repair support, and reported quality control issues. For those seeking closed-back headphones in this price range, established alternatives like the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO offer superior verified performance, ongoing manufacturer support, and significantly better cost-performance ratios. The MJ2 may appeal only to collectors interested in discontinued audio technologies or those specifically seeking the unique electret-dynamic hybrid approach despite its limitations.
