## Overview

The Thomann S-100mk2 is a stereo power amplifier from the t.amp brand, sold by the major German musical equipment retailer, Thomann. It is designed as a professional amplifier delivering 2x65W into 8Ω and 2x100W into 4Ω, housed in a 1U rack-mountable chassis. It features basic functionality including XLR/TRS balanced inputs, bridge mode capability, and fanless operation, making it primarily intended for PA applications and small studios. Some traditional design considerations are evident, such as the use of a toroidal transformer and a specified damping factor of over 150.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The official specifications lack concrete values for THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), which makes a scientific evaluation of its audio quality impossible. There is insufficient data for a meaningful comparison against modern transparency standards (e.g., THD below 0.01%, SNR above 105dB). While a damping factor of over 150 is stated, the crosstalk figure of over -70dB is ambiguous and does not guarantee it meets the ideal level. Given that modern amplifiers like the Fosi Audio V3 achieve a THD+N of less than 0.005% and a SINAD of 88dB, this unit, with its undisclosed performance data, significantly lags in scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This unit employs conventional technologies, including a toroidal transformer, a Class AB amplifier design, and fanless operation. However, this is merely a combination of established technologies, lacking any notable innovation or advancement. When compared to the current mainstream of Class D amplifiers utilizing PFFB (Post-Filter Feedback) technology, such as those with the TPA3255 chipset, its technology level is below average. It falls far short of industry-leading products that incorporate cutting-edge modules from Hypex or Purifi.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Against its market price of 37,730 JPY, there are stereo power amplifiers that offer superior performance for less money. For example, the Fosi Audio V3 (15,999 JPY) provides significantly higher power output and publishes excellent measured performance, including a THD+N of under 0.005%. Functionally, it is an equivalent stereo amplifier, but its performance is clearly superior. A direct comparison yields the calculation: 15,999 JPY ÷ 37,730 JPY = 0.424. This demonstrates that the cost-performance of this unit is poor.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Thomann is a major company with over 30 years of experience in the musical equipment industry, suggesting a reasonable level of reliability. Its warranty and after-sales service are at the industry standard. As an analog device, firmware updates are not applicable. While specific data on failure rates or MTBF is not published, it is presumed to meet the minimum reliability required for professional equipment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While the robust design for PA applications is rational, the failure to disclose fundamental audio performance data is irrational in the context of modern demands for transparency. Practical features like fanless operation and rack-mount compatibility are commendable. However, the adherence to an outdated Class AB design instead of leveraging modern Class D technology for better efficiency and performance, combined with a lack of commitment to achieving transparency-level measurements, calls the rationality of its design philosophy into question.

## Advice

While this unit can handle basic amplification needs in a professional PA environment, it is not recommended for applications where audio fidelity and scientific performance are priorities. Considering the 37,730 JPY price, there is no logical reason to choose this unit from a cost-performance perspective when the Fosi Audio V3 (15,999 JPY) offers clearly documented, near-transparent performance for less than half the price. For a similar budget, a wide array of far more capable options is available. Even for PA use, where higher fidelity can now be achieved at a lower cost, the justification for selecting this amplifier is extremely limited.
