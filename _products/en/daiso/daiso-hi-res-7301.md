## Overview

The Daiso Hi-Res 7301 is an exceptionally affordable entry into the Hi-Res Audio realm, retailing for 4 USD at Daiso stores in Japan. It uses 10 mm dynamic drivers and claims a 20 Hz–40,000 Hz response. Crucially, the model **is listed by the Japan Audio Society (JAS) as a Hi-Res AUDIO logo–certified product**. The product page indicates an **in-line remote with microphone**, aluminum housings, and a 3.5 mm TRRS plug—covering basic day-to-day functionality at an ultra-budget price point. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Objective measurements are limited. According to the on-package specs reported by a third party: **sensitivity 100 ± 3 dB/mW**, **impedance 18 Ω**, **10 mm driver**, and microphone specs (**–42 ± 3 dB**, **100 Hz–10 kHz**). Frequency response is claimed at **20 Hz–40 kHz**. These numbers suggest adequate driveability from portable devices but do **not** verify low distortion (THD/IMD) or linear frequency response. In the absence of standardized, independent lab data, our confidence relies mostly on catalog/packaging specs rather than verified acoustic performance, so we score below the default 0.5 starting point. [1][2][5]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A conventional 10 mm single dynamic driver, basic cable, and simple aluminum shells put this firmly in entry-level tech territory. The Hi-Res certification indicates the product meets the JAS logo criteria (including extended bandwidth) but **does not** imply advanced transducer tech or state-of-the-art acoustics. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Using our standard method (comparing against the **cheapest** functionally equivalent product with **equal or better** performance we can identify): among widely available options, **KZ ZSN Pro X (with mic)** is a credible step-up in measured/subjective performance and remains very inexpensive at **21 USD** direct from a mainstream retailer. That is **still** far above this Daiso’s ~4 USD street price, so the 7301 hits our maximum cost-performance. (Examples of step-up alternatives shown below for context.) [4][6]

- **KZ ZSN Pro X (with mic)** — 21 USD (detachable cable; widely measured to perform well for the price). [4][6]  
- **Moondrop Chu II** — typically ~22.99 USD in the US (no in-line mic by default; strong measured FR for the class). [3][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As an ultra-budget consumable, long-term durability and formal support are limited. Typical weak points at this price include strain reliefs, cable terminations, and driver housings.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design prioritizes **achieving Hi-Res logo eligibility at minimum cost** rather than transparent sound. The published 20 Hz–40 kHz figure primarily meets logo requirements; audible improvements depend on linearity, distortion control, and quality control—areas where there’s little verified data for this model. [1]

## Advice

If you specifically want a **Hi-Res-logo-certified** wired earphone for the lowest possible outlay, this is among the cheapest we could verify. If your priority is **sound quality** over certification, consider widely lauded budget IEMs such as **KZ ZSN Pro X (with mic)** around 21 USD or **Moondrop Chu II** around 22.99 USD; both have abundant third-party impressions/measurements indicating stronger acoustic performance for only a modest increase in price.
