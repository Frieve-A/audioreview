## Overview

The DAISO AL-002 High-Quality Stereo Earphones represent the company's entry into the ultra-budget audio market at 2.20 USD. These wired earphones feature a 10mm dynamic driver with aluminum alloy housing, integrated microphone, and standard 3.5mm connectivity. DAISO, originally known as a discount retail chain, has expanded into various product categories including consumer electronics. The AL-002 targets users seeking basic audio functionality at the lowest possible price point, competing in the sub-5 USD wired earphone segment where options are extremely limited.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. Available specifications include a 20Hz-20kHz frequency response range and 104±3dB output pressure level, both within standard parameters for budget earphones. However, no measurements are available for critical audio quality indicators including harmonic distortion (THD), signal-to-noise ratio, or passive isolation performance. For headphones/earphones, optimal performance requires THD below 0.05%, S/N ratio above 100dB, and frequency response within ±1dB deviation. Without third-party measurements or comprehensive manufacturer specifications for these key metrics, the product receives a conservative base score of 0.5 for products lacking audio-quality-relevant measurement information.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The AL-002 employs conventional 10mm dynamic driver technology with aluminum alloy housing, representing mature, widely-available technology without innovative features. As a likely OEM/ODM product for budget lineup expansion, it demonstrates no technical differentiation from standard budget earphones. The analog-only design lacks proprietary patent technology, advanced integration of digital/software components, or significant know-how accumulation. The technology offers no competitive advantage duration and would be easy for competitors to replicate. While the aluminum housing provides basic durability benefits over plastic alternatives, the overall technical implementation represents bottom-tier execution appropriate only for extreme price constraints.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

Current market price: 2.20 USD. Extensive research of the ultra-budget earphone market revealed that finding wired earphones with microphones under 5 USD is extremely challenging, with most comparable options starting at 8-12 USD range. The AL-002 provides 10mm dynamic drivers, integrated microphone for calls and voice recording, 3.5mm 4-pole connectivity, 1.2m cable length, and aluminum alloy housing for durability. Equipped with these key functions, and frequency response range (20Hz-20kHz) and output pressure level (104±3dB) are equivalent-or-better to typical budget alternatives. No products were identified with equivalent or better user-facing functions and specifications at a lower price point, making the AL-002 the cheapest option providing these features in the global market. CP = 1.0 (No cheaper equivalent alternatives found).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

DAISO operates a no-return policy where all sales are final, with only a 7-day window for defective products requiring customer service contact. User reports document significant cable microphonics issues where the earphone cord transmits noise when contacting clothing, with reviewers noting "the moment the earphone cord touches my clothing, it suddenly turns into a stethoscope," rendering the product unusable during movement or walking. The minimal warranty coverage, absence of repair services (replacement-only for defects), and documented functional problems significantly compromise reliability expectations. Support infrastructure relies primarily on dealer-based assistance with minimal manufacturer involvement, and no firmware update considerations apply to this passive analog product.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

DAISO's corporate philosophy emphasizes "manufacturing through human development" and creating "quality beyond expectations" through technology as a means to create human value. The AL-002 demonstrates practical cost optimization while maintaining basic audio functionality, with aluminum alloy housing providing durability advantages over plastic alternatives at this extreme price point. The choice of standard dynamic driver technology represents rational engineering for the budget constraints, focusing on essential functions rather than premium features. However, the design approach remains conservative without innovation or scientific advancement, and the documented cable quality issues suggest insufficient attention to fundamental usability requirements. The philosophy balances cost reduction with functional necessity but lacks the measurement-focused development and cutting-edge technology adoption emphasized in DAISO's broader corporate vision.

## Advice

The DAISO AL-002 fills a unique market position as potentially the world's cheapest wired earphones with integrated microphone, making it suitable for users requiring basic audio functionality at absolute minimum cost. Consider this product if you need backup earphones, temporary replacements, or basic voice calling capability where premium sound quality is not essential. However, be aware of significant limitations including cable microphonics that may interfere with mobile use, minimal warranty protection, and no-return policy. For users prioritizing reliability or consistent daily use, investing in slightly more expensive alternatives (8-12 USD range) may provide better long-term value despite higher upfront costs. The AL-002 represents a functional but compromise-heavy solution best suited for specific use cases where extreme price sensitivity outweighs quality concerns.
