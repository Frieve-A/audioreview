## Overview

The Aston Spirit is a large-diaphragm condenser microphone with a 1-inch, gold-evaporated dual-diaphragm capsule and three selectable polar patterns (cardioid, omnidirectional, figure-8). It provides switchable pads (-20/-10/0 dB) and an 80 Hz high-pass filter, and requires 48 V phantom power [1][2]. Typical US street price is **369 USD** [3]. As a JP market reference, recent domestic listing shows **52,800円** (tax-in) [6].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Manufacturer specs indicate 20 Hz–20 kHz (±3 dB) response, self-noise 14 dB-A, and max SPL 138 dB at 0.5% THD [2]. The official resources include frequency-response plots with a presence-region/upper-treble lift, confirming intentional coloration rather than neutrality [1]. Given this voiced, color-adding design, fidelity to the input is limited for strict transparency use.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Conventional LDC architecture with transformer-balanced output, multi-pattern switching, and standard pad/high-pass facilities. No evidence of novel transducer/circuitry advancing measured transparency beyond established peers [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Reference market price for the review target is **369 USD** [3]. The cheapest equal-or-better alternative identified is **CAD M179**: continuously variable patterns, **11 dB-A** self-noise, and **143 dB** max SPL with pad, with comparable functionality [4]. New-item pricing at **199.99 USD** is available from reputable listings [4][5].  
Explicit calculation: **199.99 USD ÷ 369 USD = 0.54 → score 0.5**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Aston provides standard warranty via global dealers. Long-term field data are less extensive than legacy brands, but construction and parts suggest typical expectations for a solid-state LDC [1][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The product prioritizes an “open, sparkly” voicing over strict neutrality, trading fidelity for character [1][2]. From a measurement-first perspective, this is rational only for users explicitly seeking that coloration.

## Advice

Choose Spirit if you specifically want a bright, presence-forward tonality on certain sources. If neutrality and spec-forward performance matter, **CAD M179** offers lower noise and broader pattern control for less money [4][5]. As an alternative character mic at a lower street price, **AKG P420** provides three patterns and very high SPL handling, though its self-noise spec is slightly higher than Spirit’s [7].
