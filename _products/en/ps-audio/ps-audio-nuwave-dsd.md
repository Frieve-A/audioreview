## Overview

The PS Audio NuWave DSD is an American-manufactured digital-to-analog converter originally priced at 1,299 USD, featuring trickle-down technology from PS Audio's flagship DirectStream DAC. This Boulder, Colorado-built unit supports PCM up to 24-bit/352.8kHz via USB and I2S, with DSD64/128 capability. The DAC employs an ESS ES9010K2M SABRE chip with proprietary CPLD processing, Class A hybrid output stage, and passive analog filtering. Its substantial 20-pound construction includes a massive toroidal transformer with seven regulators and 15,000μF storage capacitance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Mixed measurement performance places the NuWave DSD between problematic and transparent levels. Frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz ±0.25dB exceeds transparent requirements [1]. However, THD specification of <0.02% sits at the borderline, with Stereophile measurements revealing significant variation: 0.07% at full-scale versus 0.009% at -10dBFS [1]. S/N ratio >100dB meets minimum transparent level without significant margin. Audio Science Review classified it in the "OK" category among 175 tested DACs, noting visible distortion products [2]. The slow-rolloff reconstruction filter produces aliasing spuriae and noise floor modulation during dual-tone testing [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sophisticated implementation showcases several advanced features. The proprietary CPLD handles sample rate detection, jitter reduction, and data reclocking—a more complex approach than basic DAC implementations. PS Audio's Native Mode processing avoids sample rate conversion, while passive analog filtering represents their proprietary design philosophy. The substantial power supply with massive toroidal transformer and Class A hybrid output stage demonstrates engineering investment. However, the ESS ES9010K2M represents mainstream rather than cutting-edge DAC technology, and the analog-focused design lacks modern digital integration features.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

At current used market prices of 535 USD, the NuWave DSD faces strong competition from modern budget DACs. The SMSL SU-9 at 439 USD provides equivalent-or-better functionality with superior measured performance: THD+N 0.00009% versus <0.02%, SINAD 120dB versus ~100dB, and 32-bit/768kHz PCM support versus 24-bit/352.8kHz [3]. The SU-9 additionally offers Bluetooth connectivity, MQA decoding, and variable output functionality absent from the NuWave DSD.

CP = 439 ÷ 535 = 0.8

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Excellent reliability characteristics and manufacturer support. PS Audio provides a 3-year limited warranty, above the typical 2-year standard [4]. The robust construction with minimal moving parts and quality toroidal transformer suggests inherent reliability. Manufacturing in Boulder, Colorado ensures quality control, though the unit cannot be field-updated like higher-end PS Audio models. The company maintains global distribution with authorized repair centers and established customer service infrastructure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

PS Audio's design philosophy relies heavily on subjective evaluations and questionable claims. The company selected the ES9010K2M chip after testing multiple options for being "the most musical"—a subjective rather than measurement-based decision [5]. Claims about passive filtering superiority and DSD's "analog-like" sound lack ABX validation or controlled testing evidence. The manual emphasizes power conditioner importance and cable quality effects without scientific support [4]. Heavy transformer investment and premium construction contribute to cost without proportional measurement improvements compared to modern budget alternatives.

## Advice

The NuWave DSD represents traditional high-end audio engineering with premium construction and proprietary processing, but its measured performance fails to justify current pricing against modern competition. Buyers seeking transparent DAC performance should consider the SMSL SU-9 or similar budget options offering superior specifications. The NuWave DSD may appeal to those valuing American manufacturing and PS Audio's design philosophy, though scientific evidence doesn't support claims of sonic superiority. For 535 USD, multiple current-production DACs deliver better measured performance with modern features.
