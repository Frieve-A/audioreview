## Overview

**Alpine Headphones (model family SV-H300: SV-H300UW/UB)** were Alpine Electronics’ bid to bring its car-audio know-how to a lifestyle headset. At launch they were priced at **299 USD** and centered on Alpine’s patented **TKR3 (Tuned Kinetic/Kenetic Resonance 3)** system: a bass transducer embedded in the headband that adds synchronized vibration to the sound, aiming to approximate a “live concert” feel when paired with the Level Play smartphone app. The product is **discontinued**, but the official page remains available for reference with full specifications and feature descriptions. [1][2][3][4]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Documented manufacturer specs include **frequency response 15–24,000 Hz**, **impedance 30 Ω**, **max SPL 107 dB (±3 dB @1 kHz)**, and **THD < 0.1% (1 mW/1 kHz)**; the **internal battery is rated around 10 hours** for the powered TKR3/vibration circuit. The app connects via **Bluetooth Low Energy** only—**audio itself is wired**—a design noted by independent reviews. However, there are **no publicly available third-party lab graphs** (full FR magnitude/phase, THD vs. SPL, isolation curves) to verify transparency claims; reviewers further report **audible leakage** and occasional **fidelity trade-offs** when the haptics are engaged. Given the reliance on unverified specs plus evidence of potential acoustic compromises, we weight scientific validity below the provisional midpoint. [1][2][3][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

On the engineering side, TKR3’s integrated **headband bass transducer** and **on-board DSP/24-bit A/D–D/A path** for app-based EQ represent real system integration beyond a basic OEM headset. Still, the **core acoustic drivers are conventional 40 mm dynamics**, and the BLE link is used solely for control—not audio streaming—so the novelty is mostly in the **tactile add-on**, not in transducer or codec advances. It’s an above-average technical effort for its era, but not category-leading today. [2][3][4]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

For a fair benchmark we compare to the **cheapest current over-ear with a broadly equivalent user function (built-in haptic bass)** and non-inferior general performance. The **Skullcandy Crusher Evo** is a current, mainstream haptic model with “Sensory Bass,” 40 mm drivers, app EQ, and a **list price of 209.99 USD** on the manufacturer’s site; third-party measurements confirm normal headphone behavior (no glaring performance deficits) alongside the haptic feature. In contrast, **Alpine Headphones** are discontinued with no stable new-market price; their **launch MSRP was 299 USD**. We therefore compute CP against MSRP:

**CP = 209.99 ÷ 299 = 0.70… → 0.7**

This replaces earlier non-haptic comparators because they lacked TKR3-class functionality and thus weren’t like-for-like for functional value. [2][4][5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Alpine (under Alps Alpine) is a stable brand, but **this headset is explicitly marked “Discontinued”** on Alpine’s regional site. Replacement parts/app longevity are uncertain; the **Level Play app was region-limited** per Alpine’s note, and the haptic system adds **battery and mechanical components** that could be future failure points. We keep a neutral score given brand backing but limited product-line track record and end-of-life status. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design emphasizes **experiential vibration** over pure acoustic transparency. Independent reviews praise the effect’s fun factor on some content yet also report **leakage** and **reduced fidelity on certain tracks** with haptics enabled—trade-offs that don’t advance measured audio accuracy. As such, the conceptual payoff is niche and entertainment-oriented rather than evidence-led hi-fi improvement. [2][3]

## Advice

If you specifically want **built-in haptics** today, consider **Skullcandy Crusher Evo** (209.99 USD list) as the functional peer with ongoing support and modern wireless convenience. If you **prioritize neutral audio** over vibration, **Audio-Technica ATH-M40x** remains a strong wired option around **99 USD** at US retailers; for higher-tier voicing and staging on a wired path, **Sennheiser HD 560S** and **beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro** are proven references (different use cases: open-back vs. closed-back).
