## Overview

The EarFun Wave Pro is a wireless over-ear headphone released in 2024. It features 40mm DLC composite drivers and achieves Hi-Res Audio certification with an ultra-wide frequency range extending to 40kHz. Key features include up to 45dB of active noise cancellation using QuietSmart 2.0 technology, Bluetooth 5.3 with LDAC codec support, and up to 80 hours of battery life. The headphones also incorporate AI calling functionality with five microphones, multipoint connectivity, and custom EQ app support. The price point is set at 79.99 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The EarFun Wave Pro demonstrates good measured performance results. According to SoundGuys measurements, the wireless connection shows a generally balanced frequency response with minor deviations at 300Hz, 3kHz, and above 10kHz that remain within acceptable tolerances. High-volume distortion levels do not reach problematic thresholds, and MDQAS testing yields average ratings. Frequency response changes when ANC is enabled are minimal. However, a wired connection significantly degrades audio quality, with measurements showing excessive bass emphasis and reduced clarity, making it unsuitable for professional audio work. Overall, while not achieving transparent levels, the headphones avoid problematic measurement values and can be evaluated as having above-average scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Technologically, the implementation shows industry-standard level performance. The 40mm DLC composite drivers represent a conventional application of material technology without particular uniqueness. The QuietSmart 2.0 ANC technology and five-microphone implementation match competitive product standards. Bluetooth 5.3 support with LDAC, AAC, and SBC codecs demonstrates adaptation to current technology but represents no special technological innovation. The 80-hour extended battery life exemplifies excellent power management technology implementation, though using existing technology combinations. Hi-Res Audio support also represents standard implementation levels. Overall, while demonstrating solid technical competence, no industry-leading proprietary development or groundbreaking original design is evident.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At a price of 79.99 USD, the EarFun Wave Pro offers all key features such as LDAC support, high-performance active noise cancellation, and long battery life. There are currently no cheaper alternatives in the market that offer equivalent or superior functionality. For instance, the Anker Soundcore Space Q45, which also features LDAC and high-performance ANC, retails for approximately 150 USD. The Wave Pro provides the same core functionality at about half the price. As it is effectively the world's most affordable product with these essential features and performance for users, its cost-performance receives the highest rating of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a relatively new brand, EarFun's reliability and support structure are at an industry-average standard. Product failure rate data is limited, but no major quality issues have been reported. The warranty period is a standard one year, with international support infrastructure being limited compared to major manufacturers. While firmware update support is provided, its frequency and continuity fall short of established manufacturers. Repair infrastructure and after-sales support also face regional constraints, with the completeness of the global support network being insufficient. As an emerging manufacturer, EarFun provides standard support levels but has not reached the established support infrastructure of companies like Sony or Audio-Technica.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates a generally rational direction. The focus on high-quality audio transmission through LDAC support and Hi-Res Audio certification represents rational choices contributing to measurable audio quality improvements. The 80-hour extended battery life provides meaningful improvements that significantly enhance practicality. The 45dB ANC performance also provides scientifically measurable effects. The strategy of covering major features while maintaining an affordable price represents a rational approach for cost-performance-focused users. However, audio quality degradation during a wired connection is a design flaw, indicating insufficient optimization of the audio circuitry. Overall, while the direction toward achieving transparent levels according to measurement criteria is commendable, some implementation aspects show room for improvement.

## Advice

The EarFun Wave Pro, at 79.99 USD, offers LDAC support, high-performance ANC, and an 80-hour battery life, making it an extremely excellent choice in terms of cost-performance. Measurements from SoundGuys confirm that the audio quality is sufficient for general music listening, and for budget-conscious users in particular, it is difficult to find a product with such a comprehensive feature set at this price.

Admittedly, higher-end models like the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 (approx. 150 USD) offer more refined ANC performance and accessories (like a hard case), but at nearly double the price. On the other hand, since EarFun is an emerging brand, there are uncertainties regarding long-term support and brand reliability.

In conclusion, for users who want high-quality wireless audio via LDAC, powerful noise cancellation, and an exceptional battery life on the tightest possible budget, the EarFun Wave Pro is one of the most rational choices on the market today. If you prioritize outstanding price-to-performance ratio over brand reliability, this product is highly recommended.
