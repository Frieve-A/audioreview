## Overview

The EarFun Tune Pro is a wireless over-ear headphone released in December 2024, featuring an exceptional 120-hour battery life as its primary selling point. Manufactured by Chinese company EarFun, this model offers a comprehensive feature set at a market price of 60 USD in Japan, including hybrid Active Noise Cancelling (ANC), Bluetooth 5.4, and multipoint connection capabilities. The dual-driver configuration with 40mm and 10mm drivers has earned Hi-Res Audio certification, positioning it as an entry-level product that caters to a specific user need.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The acoustic measurement results fall far short of transparency levels. Multiple review sites consistently identify a pronounced V-shaped frequency response. The high frequencies exhibit multiple peaks that cannot be fully corrected even with the included 10-band EQ. While the bass has quantity, it lacks control, resulting in reduced clarity for percussion instruments. Codec support is limited to SBC and AAC only, without support for higher-quality codecs like LDAC or aptX. While Hi-Res Audio support over a wired connection is a plus, the wireless sound quality limitations are clear. The estimated frequency response deviation from measurement data significantly exceeds the Â±3dB range, resulting in a low scientific validity rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Technically, the EarFun Tune Pro lacks notable innovation. The combination of a 40mm PET composite film driver and a 10mm LCP polymer driver represents a standard configuration without unique characteristics. Bluetooth 5.4 and multipoint connection support demonstrate compliance with current standards but remain at the industry baseline. The QuietSmart 2.0 ANC system, while uniquely branded, is essentially a conventional hybrid ANC setup using five microphones. The 120-hour battery life demonstrates excellent power management design, but this is an application of existing technologies. Overall, the technology level is slightly below the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This product demonstrates outstanding cost-performance for its unique feature set. At its market price of 60 USD, there are no other products on the current market that meet all three criteria: Active Noise Cancelling, multipoint connection, and a battery life of 120 hours or more. Cheaper alternatives significantly compromise on battery performance or lack one of the key features. Therefore, for users who require this unparalleled stamina as a mandatory condition, this product is the most affordable and only option available, earning it a perfect score for cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

EarFun, established in 2018, is a relatively new Chinese manufacturer with a limited long-term reliability track record. The product warranty is a standard one year, but details regarding domestic repair infrastructure and after-sales support in regions like Japan remain unclear. Firmware update support also shows a limited history of continuous updates, raising concerns about future support continuity. However, customer support for purchases through platforms like Amazon maintains a general service level, according to user reports. Due to the uncertainties typical of emerging manufacturers, the reliability and support aspects rate below the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design philosophy focuses on extreme specialization in one feature and cost optimization, which has a certain rationality. The 120-hour battery life offers clear, practical value by dramatically reducing the frequency of charging. The inclusion of ANC rationally addresses use cases in noisy environments. However, the trade-off is a significant compromise in audio quality, and claiming "Hi-Res Audio support" while the actual sound quality does not meet that standard is irrational. The lack of high-quality Bluetooth codec support also deviates from modern audio product design. Overall, while rational in achieving a specific function under price constraints, the design has challenges in pursuing the essential quality of an audio product.

## Advice

When considering the EarFun Tune Pro, the deciding factor is whether battery performance is your absolute top priority. If your primary goal is to find an ANC headphone with multipoint connectivity and you want to minimize charging as much as possible, then this product, offering 120 hours of runtime for 60 USD, is a unique and highly recommended choice. However, for the majority of users who are satisfied with a battery life of around 40 hours, more cost-effective and balanced alternatives like the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 (approx. 43 USD) would be a better choice. If music listening is the main purpose, it is essential to audition the product beforehand to ensure its distinct V-shaped sound signature is acceptable to you.
