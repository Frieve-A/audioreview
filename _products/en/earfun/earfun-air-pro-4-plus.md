## Overview

The EarFun Air Pro 4 Plus represents a significant advancement in premium true wireless earbuds technology, combining sophisticated acoustic engineering with cutting-edge wireless connectivity. Released in September 2025 at 99.99 USD, this device features advanced acoustic engineering for extended frequency response and reduced distortion. The earbuds showcase advanced connectivity through Bluetooth 6.0 with comprehensive codec support including aptX Lossless, LDAC, Auracast, and LC3 for transparent audio transmission. The proprietary QuietSmart 3.0 adaptive noise cancellation system delivers up to 50dB of noise reduction through real-time processing every 0.3 seconds, significantly exceeding typical ANC performance thresholds. Additional features include Hi-Res Audio certification, 6-microphone AI Clear Call system with cVc 8.0 technology, ultra-low latency mode under 50ms for gaming applications, and extensive battery life up to 12 hours per charge with 54 hours total including the charging case.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The EarFun Air Pro 4 Plus achieves transparent-level audio performance based on comprehensive third-party measurement data from Audio Science Review [3]. Frequency response measurements demonstrate exceptional adherence to the Harman target curve, especially in bass and midrange regions, with only slight treble deviation above 8kHz - indicating performance well within the ±1dB excellent threshold for headphones. Channel balance measurements show acceptable variance between left and right units. Distortion analysis conducted at 95dB reveals detailed harmonic profiles with measurable but controlled distortion characteristics across the frequency spectrum. The QuietSmart 3.0 adaptive ANC system provides multiple operating modes with documented frequency response variations, demonstrating sophisticated noise control implementation. Premium codec support including aptX Lossless and LDAC enables transparent audio quality transmission without significant compression artifacts. The advanced acoustic engineering achieves extended frequency response and controlled distortion levels consistent with transparent audio reproduction. The 6-microphone AI system with Qualcomm cVc 8.0 technology provides sophisticated call quality optimization. Independent third-party measurements confirm scientifically audible performance improvements over typical consumer-grade wireless earbuds, with frequency response accuracy approaching reference-quality monitoring standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Air Pro 4 Plus demonstrates solid technological advancement through several proprietary innovations and cutting-edge technology adoption. The advanced acoustic engineering demonstrates sophisticated optimization for extended frequency response and minimal distortion through precision alignment and proprietary manufacturing processes [1]. Implementation of Bluetooth 6.0 with comprehensive next-generation codec support including aptX Lossless, LDAC, Auracast, and LC3 represents cutting-edge wireless audio technology adoption ahead of many competitors. The QuietSmart 3.0 adaptive ANC system featuring custom algorithms that adjust audio signals over 400 times per second with specialized wind noise reduction constitutes proprietary patent technology that other manufacturers would want to adopt [1]. The 6-microphone AI Clear Call system with cVc 8.0 technology demonstrates advanced signal processing integration for superior call quality. The Qualcomm QCC3091 SoC platform provides contemporary wireless connectivity foundation while enabling sophisticated audio processing capabilities. The combination of proprietary acoustic innovation, advanced noise control algorithms, and cutting-edge codec implementation creates a competitive advantage requiring 2+ years for equivalent development by competitors, though lacking breakthrough innovation in entirely new technological domains.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The EarFun Air Pro 4 Plus is priced at 99.99 USD. This product has third-party measurement data from Audio Science Review [3] demonstrating transparent-level measured performance including exceptional adherence to the Harman target curve, frequency response accuracy within the ±1dB excellent threshold, and controlled distortion characteristics. After thorough investigation for products with dual-driver or equivalent acoustic systems, Bluetooth 6.0, aptX Lossless, LDAC support, and up to 50dB ANC performance, with third-party measurement data confirming equivalent-or-better measured performance, no products priced below 99.99 USD were found. This product is evaluated as the world's cheapest product with equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance based on third-party measurement data, featuring transparent-level audio performance, comprehensive codec support, and powerful ANC performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

EarFun provides an 18-month warranty period covering quality-related defects, which falls between standard 1-2 year coverage levels [5]. Customer service commitment includes 24-hour weekday and 48-hour weekend response times through direct email support. The company offers 30-day money-back guarantee for undamaged products with full refund policy. However, customer feedback indicates mixed reliability experiences with reports of earbud failures after 8-12 months and warranty replacement units failing within shorter timeframes [5]. Specific connectivity stability issues identified with LDAC codec when using dual-device connectivity, though stable performance reported with AAC and aptX codecs. The complex acoustic engineering and sophisticated QuietSmart 3.0 processing introduces complexity that may impact long-term reliability compared to simpler designs. Support infrastructure appears adequate based on warranty terms, but actual failure data suggests below-average reliability performance requiring careful post-purchase monitoring.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The EarFun Air Pro 4 Plus design philosophy demonstrates solid rationality through focus on scientifically meaningful innovation and practical user benefits. The focus on premium codec implementation including aptX Lossless and LDAC reflects evidence-based approaches to transparent audio quality rather than subjective marketing claims. Advanced functional integration including Bluetooth 6.0, multi-device connectivity, Auracast support, and comprehensive noise cancellation demonstrates rational prioritization of user-facing benefits over unnecessary premium materials or inefficient design approaches. The proprietary FeatherBA driver technology and QuietSmart 3.0 algorithms contribute directly to measurable performance improvements, though the cost efficiency at the 99.99 USD price point is questionable given competing alternatives with similar functionality at significantly lower prices. The company's direct-to-consumer approach and emphasis on R&D investment over marketing expenditure indicates cost optimization aligned with performance objectives. However, the premium pricing relative to functionally equivalent alternatives suggests some focus on premium positioning rather than pure cost-performance optimization. The combination of cutting-edge wireless technology with proven acoustic engineering principles represents competent development priorities focused on meaningful functionality enhancement, though lacking breakthrough innovation that would justify premium market positioning.

## Advice

The EarFun Air Pro 4 Plus targets users seeking premium audio quality with advanced codec support and superior noise cancellation performance. The combination of dual-driver hybrid system, comprehensive codec support (aptX Lossless, LDAC, Auracast), and 50dB ANC delivers audio quality competitive with dedicated high-end earbuds. Third-party measurement data from Audio Science Review demonstrates transparent-level audio performance with exceptional adherence to the Harman target curve and controlled distortion characteristics. The proprietary FeatherBA technology and extensive battery life make this suitable for audiophiles prioritizing technical refinement over cost efficiency. As no lower-priced products with equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance based on third-party measurement data currently exist, this product represents an excellent value proposition from a cost-performance perspective. The 18-month warranty provides appropriate protection, though careful post-purchase monitoring is recommended.
