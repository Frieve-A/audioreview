## Overview

The EarFun Air Pro 4i (model TW230) represents the company's approach to delivering high-functionality wireless earbuds at accessible pricing, primarily available in Asian markets including Japan. Featuring 11mm titanium-coated composite drivers, claimed 50dB active noise cancellation through QuietSmart 3.0 technology, and LDAC high-resolution codec support, these earbuds target budget-conscious consumers seeking advanced features. With 9.5 hours single-charge battery life (6.5 hours with LDAC), 40 hours total with charging case, IP55 water resistance, and multipoint connectivity, the Air Pro 4i competes within the budget true wireless segment. The product incorporates Qualcomm's QCC3091 chipset with Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity and supports multiple audio codecs including aptX Lossless.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity assessment is limited by sparse third-party measurement data. While independent reviews from Japanese sources [5] provide qualitative confirmation of ANC functionality, comprehensive technical measurements for key audio quality indicators remain unavailable. The claimed frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz and 50dB ANC performance lack verification through detailed third-party testing with proper measurement equipment. Available independent reviews confirm basic ANC functionality but lack the detailed frequency response graphs, THD measurements, or SINAD data necessary for comprehensive evaluation. Conservative evaluation is applied due to limited verifiable measurement data for core audio quality parameters, with reliance primarily on manufacturer specifications rather than independent verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Air Pro 4i demonstrates contemporary technology implementation with some proprietary development. The product adopts QuietSmart 3.0 ANC technology featuring custom algorithms that adjust audio signals 400+ times per second and include specialized wind noise reduction. This represents proprietary patent technology that competitors would want to adopt. The implementation uses Qualcomm's recent QCC3091 chipset supporting current high-quality codecs including LDAC and aptX Lossless with Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity, representing appropriate contemporary technology adoption. However, the overall approach relies primarily on proven OEM platforms with limited in-house design beyond ANC tuning. While the ANC implementation shows technical sophistication, the basic chipset approach provides relatively limited competitive advantage duration, as competitors can replicate similar functionality using the same Qualcomm platform.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The Air Pro 4i delivers strong cost-performance at 53 USD (primarily available in Asian markets). Equipped with equivalent core functions (LDAC codec support, ANC, multipoint connectivity) and battery performance comparable to the Anker Soundcore Space A40 (49 USD current market price), which provides equivalent-or-better functionality with superior battery performance and faster charging capabilities. CP = 49 USD รท 53 USD = 0.9. The comparison target offers equivalent LDAC support, multipoint connectivity, and ANC functionality while providing 7 hours 55 minutes battery life with ANC versus the Air Pro 4i's 6.5 hours with LDAC, plus faster charging (10 minutes for 4 hours versus 2 hours) at a lower current market price. However, the Air Pro 4i provides competitive value with additional advantages including IP55 dust protection versus IPX4 water-only resistance and Bluetooth 5.4 versus 5.2.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

EarFun provides standard reliability and support infrastructure for the audio industry. The company offers an 18-month warranty period from purchase date, which exceeds the basic 1-year minimum but remains below the 3-year threshold for excellent rating. Support infrastructure includes email-based customer service with defined response times (24 hours weekdays, 48 hours weekends) and web-based warranty claim processing. The true wireless earbud construction represents average complexity for the product category with no particular indicators of enhanced durability or fragile design. As a company established in 2018, EarFun has limited long-term track record for reliability assessment. No specific failure rate data or extended parts supply information is available. The support system operates through standard manufacturer channels without specialized repair services or global infrastructure that would merit higher evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

EarFun demonstrates rational design philosophy focused on cost-effective delivery of practical functionality. The company's mission to provide "high functionality while keeping prices low" translates into designs where costs directly contribute to function and performance improvement. The approach actively reduces meaningless expenses relative to performance by utilizing proven Qualcomm platforms rather than expensive proprietary development. Advanced functional integration suits user purposes through appropriate combination of ANC, multipoint connection, app control, and gaming features. However, the design philosophy shows limitations in scientific approach, with performance claims lacking transparent measurement data and limited emphasis on measurement-focused development. The company relies partially on marketing claims without complete scientific verification, particularly regarding the claimed 50dB ANC performance. The conservative but rational approach to established technology platforms represents appropriate cost optimization, though innovation remains limited beyond ANC algorithm development.

## Advice

The EarFun Air Pro 4i merits consideration for budget-conscious users prioritizing practical functionality over premium construction or verified measurement performance. The strong cost-performance ratio makes it suitable for general music listening, calls, and casual use where the combination of ANC, multipoint connectivity, and LDAC support provides value. Users requiring verified audio quality measurements should await independent testing or consider alternatives with published third-party measurements. The 18-month warranty and standard support infrastructure provide adequate coverage for typical consumer use. Consider the IP55 rating advantageous for active use compared to IPX4-only alternatives. The claimed 50dB ANC performance, if accurate, would represent excellent value, but verification through actual use or independent testing is recommended before purchase decisions based on noise cancellation requirements.
