## Overview

The EarFun Air Pro 4 is a wireless earbud model released in 2024, featuring the Qualcomm QCC3091 chipset with support for aptX Lossless, LDAC, and Hi-Res Audio for high-quality sound reproduction. Priced at 67 USD, it offers premium features including 50dB adaptive hybrid ANC, Bluetooth 5.4, and a 52-hour extended playback time. While the model received a VGP 2024 Gold Award and high evaluation in the Japanese market, concerns about reliability due to its emerging brand status have been noted.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The frequency response follows the Harman target curve well, with minor dips in the 8-11kHz high-frequency range, but overall demonstrates balanced characteristics. THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) is under 0.7%; while not reaching the ideal level for earbuds (under 0.05%), it is not a level that poses a practical problem. The 50dB adaptive hybrid ANC is excellent, significantly exceeding the "excellent" level (30dB or above) in earbud isolation performance standards. The acoustic performance of the 10mm composite diaphragm driver is good, with measurable sound quality improvements confirmed.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Qualcomm QCC3091 is a current-generation premium chipset, and its support for both aptX Lossless and LDAC, which are competing major high-quality codecs, is technically advanced. The 50dB ANC performance through QuietSmart 3.0 demonstrates industry-leading technical capabilities. The design appropriately integrates the latest technologies, including a 6-microphone array for AI noise reduction, Bluetooth 5.4 support, and multipoint connection. This is not a simple combination of OEM products but a product with custom tuning, achieving a high level of technical sophistication.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At a price of 67 USD, there are no other products on the current market that offer support for both aptX Lossless and LDAC, combined with powerful 50dB active noise cancellation. While higher-end models with similar features exist, their prices are significantly higher. Therefore, this product is effectively the most affordable option among those with equivalent or superior functionality, earning it the highest cost-performance rating of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

EarFun is a relatively new brand, and its long-term quality track record is unclear, leaving some uncertainty regarding reliability. While the warranty period is standard, repair systems and after-sales support in Japan may be inferior compared to major manufacturers. Additionally, a lack of availability at major electronics retailers could make accessing post-purchase support difficult. Although the product's appeal as an emerging manufacturer is high, its reliability falls short of the level established by major, long-standing manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The product employs objective sound tuning based on the Harman target curve, adopting a scientific approach based on measurement data. It invests in technologies directly linked to audible sound quality improvements, such as the implementation of high-quality codecs like aptX Lossless and LDAC, and the adoption of effective ANC technology. The strategy of achieving price competitiveness through a direct sales model is also rational. Modern and practical features like the latest Bluetooth 5.4 and AI-processed call quality improvement are appropriately incorporated. No unscientific claims or unfounded sound improvement measures are observed, representing a product based on a rational design philosophy.

## Advice

For users who want to experience the latest high-quality codecs like aptX Lossless and LDAC, along with powerful ANC performance, at an excellent value, the EarFun Air Pro 4 is one of the most compelling choices on the market. Products with comparable features are more expensive, making this model's price competitiveness stand out. It is an especially valuable choice for users with compatible devices. However, as it is from an emerging brand, its long-term reliability is an unknown factor. It is important to verify the retailer's return and exchange policies before purchase to prepare for any potential initial defects.
