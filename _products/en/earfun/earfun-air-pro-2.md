## Overview

The EarFun Air Pro 2 is a true wireless earbud released in 2021 by the Chinese audio brand EarFun. It features 10mm titanium-coated composite diaphragm drivers and QuietSmart 2.0 hybrid ANC technology, claiming up to 40dB of noise cancellation. Key features include Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, IPX5 water resistance, and enhanced call quality via a 6-microphone array. Launched at a price of 79.99 USD (approximately 12,000 JPY at the time), it has since been discontinued from major e-commerce sites and effectively withdrawn from the market following the release of successor models.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Evaluation based on measurement data reveals issues across multiple criteria. While the frequency response stays within a ±3dB variation from 20Hz to 20kHz, a 2-3dB dip in the midrange prevents transparent reproduction. The THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) measures around 0.3%, significantly exceeding the transparent level of 0.05% or below for earphones. The S/N ratio is estimated to be around 85dB in real-world measurements, failing to reach the excellent level of 100dB or higher. The claimed 40dB ANC performance only provides about 25-30dB of attenuation in the low-frequency range in practice, which falls short of modern competitors. Bluetooth codec support is limited to SBC/AAC, with no support for high-quality codecs like aptX or LDAC. These measurements indicate a limited ability to faithfully reproduce the source audio.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The technology implemented is at an industry-average level, even for its release period. The 10mm titanium-coated composite diaphragm is a common design and does not contribute significantly to improved measured performance. The QuietSmart 2.0 ANC technology uses a standard hybrid feedforward/feedback method, and its performance is merely on par with contemporary competitors. While the Bluetooth 5.2 chipset ensures stable connectivity, it lacks support for newer standards like LE Audio or aptX Lossless, showing no technological advancement. Overall, the product is a conservative combination of existing technologies with no proprietary innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The cost-performance is extremely poor. Compared to the Air Pro 2's launch price of approximately 12,000 JPY, products with equivalent or superior ANC performance and connectivity are now available for far less. For instance, the "QCY HT05 MeloBuds," which offers comparable or better ANC, is sold for around 3,980 JPY. A comparison yields the following cost-performance calculation:

3,980 JPY ÷ 12,000 JPY ≈ 0.33

Based on this result, the score is 0.3. Considering that even its successor, the EarFun Air Pro 3, offers higher performance at a lower price, there is no financial reason to choose this product.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Although EarFun is a relatively new brand established in 2018, it maintains a basic level of product quality. It offers an 18-month product warranty and has obtained the necessary technical certifications for relevant markets. The IPX5 water resistance rating ensures minimal durability for daily use. However, firmware updates are infrequent, so post-launch feature improvements or bug fixes are unlikely. Customer support is primarily in English and Chinese, making prompt assistance in other languages difficult. While basic reliability is present, the long-term support structure has shortcomings.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The product's design philosophy is generally rational but reveals inefficiencies in terms of market competitiveness. The adoption of hybrid ANC and composite drivers are scientifically sound choices. However, a lack of thorough tuning to improve measured performance results in mediocre outcomes. The absence of support for high-quality codecs like aptX and LDAC is an irrational decision for users who prioritize sound quality. The dedicated app's functionality is limited to basic EQ adjustments, with no advanced features like AI-powered personalization. As a result, the design failed to deliver a performance advantage commensurate with its price, leading to its early exit from the market.

## Advice

The purchase of the EarFun Air Pro 2 is not recommended under any circumstances. Its measured performance is low, and its cost-performance is exceptionally poor. The market is saturated with cheaper and better-performing alternatives. Specifically, you can easily find products with comparable or superior ANC performance in the 3,000 to 5,000 JPY price range, such as the QCY HT05 MeloBuds. If considering the EarFun brand, you should opt for the successor models, such as the Air Pro 3 or later. Current users of the Air Pro 2 would very likely experience a significant improvement in both sound quality and features by upgrading to a modern set of earbuds.
