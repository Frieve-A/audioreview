## Overview

The EarFun Air Pro 4+ is a true wireless earphone that was released in May 2025. Building on the success of the company's Air Pro series, this advanced model introduces AI-powered multilingual real-time translation functionality. It features the proprietary Nano Side-Fitted Acoustic Architecture (NSAA) with a dual configuration of balanced armature and 10mm composite dynamic drivers. The Qualcomm QCC 3091 SoC enables aptX Lossless support and QuietSmart 3.0 adaptive noise cancellation up to 50dB.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The EarFun Air Pro 4+ demonstrates multiple technical specifications that indicate measurable audio quality improvements. The QuietSmart 3.0 adaptive ANC with up to 50dB performance reaches ideal ANC performance levels, delivering audibly meaningful effects. The aptX Lossless codec support theoretically enables transparent-level audio transmission. The dual driver configuration (BA + 10mm dynamic) potentially contributes to improved frequency response. However, detailed measurement data from third-party institutions (THD, SNR, frequency response ±dB values) remains unpublished, limiting evaluation to catalog specifications. The 6-microphone AI call processing system promises scientific improvements in call quality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The proprietary NSAA (Nano Side-Fitted Acoustic Architecture) represents valuable design technology for optimally positioning BA and dynamic drivers within limited housing constraints. The Qualcomm QCC 3091 is a latest-generation Bluetooth audio SoC that balances aptX Lossless processing capability with low power consumption. AI translation functionality implementation requires sophisticated DSP processing and cloud integration, representing an advanced approach within the earphone category. The 54-hour total playback time demonstrates sophisticated battery management and power management technology implementation. Compared to competing products in the same price range, the technical specification integration exceeds industry averages.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The EarFun Air Pro 4+ is priced at 99.99 USD. While its unique feature is the AI translation, a comparison focused purely on audio performance points to the "CMF Buds 2 Plus" by CMF by Nothing (69 USD) as a competitor. The CMF Buds 2 Plus offers up to 50dB of ANC and supports the high-quality LDAC codec, providing a similar level of audio functionality at a lower price. For users who do not require the AI translation feature, a more affordable alternative exists. The calculation is: 69 USD ÷ 99.99 USD = 0.69, resulting in a score of 0.7. This rating depends on how much value a user places on the added AI translation feature.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

EarFun is a relatively new audio brand but has established market recognition through the success of the Air Pro series. The company provides continuous firmware updates and is developing its support system. However, long-term failure rate data and detailed repair infrastructure information remain limited. Warranty periods and RMA (return merchandise authorization) systems are presumed to meet industry standard levels, but the support network scale is smaller compared to major manufacturers like Sony or Apple. As a product incorporating new technology, initial batch defect risks are considered at average emerging manufacturer levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The EarFun Air Pro 4+ design philosophy demonstrates a rational approach combining practical audio quality improvements with innovative functionality. The NSAA design for acoustic optimization within physical constraints represents a scientific approach contributing to measurable audio quality improvements. AI translation functionality addresses user needs in the globalization era, representing a rational direction for expanding earphone applications. aptX Lossless support is a scientifically justified technology choice aimed at achieving transparent-level audio quality. The 54-hour battery represents a practical design decision emphasizing usability.

## Advice

The EarFun Air Pro 4+ is particularly recommended for international business users or those active in multilingual environments who require AI translation functionality. For those seeking purely audio quality and ANC performance, it is rational to consider more affordable alternatives with similar performance, such as the "CMF Buds 2 Plus." While the technical specifications are attractive, the accuracy, practicality, and battery impact of the AI translation feature should be verified through reviews before purchasing. For existing Air Pro series users who do not need the translation function, the need to upgrade is low. When considering a purchase, it is also important to confirm the terms of use for the AI translation feature (e.g., whether there are monthly fees).
