## Overview

The EarFun Air Pro 3 is a true wireless earbud released in 2023. It features 11mm wool composite drivers and a Qualcomm QCC3071 chipset, delivering up to 43dB of noise cancellation performance through QuietSmart 2.0 technology. The earbuds adopt Bluetooth 5.3 and aptX Adaptive codec, and won the VGP 2023 Gold Award. With IPX5 water resistance and 45-hour battery life, it also supports LE Audio technology. Priced at 57 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The EarFun Air Pro 3 exhibits significant measurement performance issues, resulting in low scientific validity scores. In SoundGuys' measurements, the frequency response shows excessive bass emphasis with over 8dB boost from middle-C and lower, clear midrange dips from 266Hz to 1.1kHz, and high-frequency overemphasis up to 8.1kHz. The distortion performance is particularly problematic, with SoundGuys noting that "most people will find off-putting" levels of distortion that affect sound quality. The Multi-Dimensional Audio Quality Score (MDAQS) measurements reveal distortion issues that are audible to "sensitive, young, or trained ears." The 11mm wool composite driver design limitations result in noticeable lack of transparency, clarity, and resolution. Catalog THD specifications of under 0.7% do not align with actual measurement results, which show higher distortion levels that compromise fidelity to the source material.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Technologically, it demonstrates mid-level standards. The Qualcomm QCC3071 chipset and QuietSmart 2.0 hybrid ANC technology represent industry-standard implementations. Bluetooth 5.3, LE Audio, and LC3 codec support show adaptation to latest technologies, though lacking particular uniqueness. Six microphones with Qualcomm cVc 8.0 technology for call quality enhancement demonstrates reasonable technical capability, but the 11mm wool composite driver's acoustic design has limitations, with distortion and balance issues in measurement results suggesting fundamental design challenges. The 43dB ANC performance is numerically good but implementation optimization remains insufficient.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The EarFun Air Pro 3 offers a rich feature set—including aptX Adaptive support, planned LE Audio compatibility, 43dB ANC performance, and a 45-hour battery life—for 57 USD. It is difficult to find another product with an equivalent or superior feature set at a lower price, thus its cost-performance score is 1.0.

For reference, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, which offers superior measurement performance, is priced at 65 USD. A comparative calculation would be `65 USD ÷ 57 USD = 1.14`. Since the result is greater than 1.0, it confirms that the EarFun Air Pro 3 holds an advantage in price-to-performance ratio.

In conclusion, based on a pure features-to-price comparison, this product's cost-performance is rated as top-tier in the market.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

There are concerns regarding product reliability. Even with firmware 0.5.1, frequency response improvements remain limited and fundamental distortion issues persist. Multipoint connection stability is inferior to competing products (Liberty 4 NC), with reported audio output problems during device switching. EarFun's support structure is limited compared to major manufacturers, with insufficient global support networks and repair systems. Charging case connection stability also presents challenges, with reports of cases where earbuds are not properly recognized.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The design philosophy shows prominent irrational aspects. The 11mm driver enlargement aimed at sound quality improvement actually resulted in increased distortion and poor frequency balance in actual measurements, representing unscientific design decisions. Excessive low-end emphasis constitutes subjective sound tuning described as "suitable for EDM and hip-hop," deviating from high-fidelity reproduction. Better sound characteristics with ANC off indicates insufficient optimization between ANC circuitry and acoustic design. The focus on numerical 43dB ANC performance while sacrificing actual auditory balance is irrational. While LE Audio support and other new technology adoption is commendable, fundamental sound quality performance issues remain unresolved.

## Advice

The EarFun Air Pro 3 boasts top-tier cost-performance at 57 USD, but significant measurement issues limit its appeal for users who prioritize audio quality. The distortion problems confirmed in SoundGuys' measurements will be clearly perceptible to discerning listeners and compromise fidelity. The Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, at 65 USD (about 8 USD more), provides substantially better measurement performance, LDAC support, and superior overall quality, justifying the price premium for those who value sound quality.

While the VGP 2023 Gold Award is noteworthy, objective measurement data reveals fundamental acoustic limitations. For budget-conscious users who need basic ANC and can accept the measurement compromises, the Air Pro 3 is an acceptable choice. However, for those who prioritize sound quality, a small additional investment for the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC is strongly recommended. The aptX Adaptive and LE Audio support offer future-proofing but cannot compensate for the core acoustic deficiencies.
