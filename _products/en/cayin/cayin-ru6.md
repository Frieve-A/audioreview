## Overview

The Cayin RU6 is the first dongle to implement a discrete 24-bit R-2R ladder in a portable DAC/AMP. Launched in late 2021 at USD 249, it employs 96 ultra-precision low-TCR thin-film resistors (48 per channel), offers 3.5mm and 4.4mm outputs, supports PCM up to 384 kHz and DSD, provides OS/NOS modes, and uses a relay-driven resistor-array hardware volume control [3]. DSD input is internally converted to high-rate PCM for playback [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Independent measurements show notable departures from transparency. With 16/44.1 and a 1 kHz tone in OS mode, THD+N stays around **−66 dB (0.05%)** across 0.5–1.5 V outputs [1], noticeably worse than the **0.032% @ 1 kHz, 0.5 V** manufacturer spec [3], and accompanied by an irregular, HF-tilted noise floor [1]. In NOS mode, an inter-channel timing skew of ~**0.5 sample (~11 µs at 44.1 kHz)** is observed [1]. Reference Audio Analyzer reports **0.56 Ω** output impedance and **~130 mW @ 32 Ω / 14.3 mW @ 300 Ω** on the single-ended out [2]. Overall, RU6 measures well below modern sigma-delta dongles on distortion and noise.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As the first portable discrete R-2R design, the RU6 showcases genuine engineering—96× 0.1% resistors, dual 6-layer PCBs separating digital/analog domains, and a 99-step relay-based analog volume array [3]. Nevertheless, the architecture does not achieve the state-of-the-art measured performance attainable by contemporary multi-bit sigma-delta designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better):** **Truthear SHIO**, a dual-CS43198 dongle with **3.5mm + 4.4mm** outputs and hi-res support. Manufacturer claims **THD+N < 0.0002%** and **SINAD 117 dB A-wt** [4]. Official price **USD 69.99** [4] vs RU6 at **USD 249**. Functions are equivalent from a user perspective, and (per specs) SHIO’s measured performance is superior.  
**Computation:** 69.99 ÷ 249 = **0.28** → score rounded to **0.3**.  
If a cheaper equal-or-better option appears, CP should be recomputed accordingly.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Cayin is an established brand with standard warranty/support typical of the portable audio segment. No widespread reliability concerns surfaced from public information. Long-term durability advantages of a discrete topology are unproven.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Despite its originality, RU6 exhibits measurable artifacts—elevated THD+N, irregular noise behavior, and NOS-mode inter-channel delay [1][2]. Given readily available, functionally equivalent dongles with much better measurements at far lower prices, the design intent prioritizing “vintage” traits is difficult to justify for high-fidelity reproduction.

## Advice

Choose RU6 only if you specifically want R-2R behavior and accept its measured compromises. For transparency-focused, measurement-driven value, a modern dongle like **Truthear SHIO (USD 69.99)** offers equivalent I/O and superior objective performance at a fraction of the price [4].
