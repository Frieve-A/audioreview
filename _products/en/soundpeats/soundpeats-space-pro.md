## Overview

SoundPEATS Space Pro is the brand’s higher-spec over-ear model featuring coaxial dual dynamic drivers (40mm + 10mm), LDAC, Bluetooth 5.4, and hybrid active noise cancellation rated at −47dB. It also advertises up to 151 hours of playback and supports three connection modes (Bluetooth, USB, AUX). These are manufacturer specifications. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are no credible third-party measurement datasets (e.g., full frequency response/THD on standardized rigs) for Space Pro found at the time of writing. We therefore anchor to manufacturer numbers, clearly labeled as such: −47dB hybrid ANC, LDAC support, Bluetooth 5.4, coaxial 40mm + 10mm drivers, and up to 151-hour battery life. Independent verification for frequency response linearity, THD, and ANC spectra remains pending, so scientific validity stays at the default 0.5 per policy for products with unknown measured performance. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The dual-driver (40mm + 10mm) arrangement, LDAC codec support, and hybrid ANC topology are mainstream consumer implementations rather than novel architectures. Nothing in public materials indicates proprietary DSP/algorithms or technical papers/patents that would lift originality beyond category norms. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Comparator (cheapest with equivalent user-facing functions):** EarFun Wave Pro — includes LDAC, effective ANC with third-party measured reduction (~75% average reduction across the spectrum in SoundGuys’ test), multipoint, and **wired listening via 3.5mm**. Street price: **79.99 USD**. [2][3]

**Equivalence note (user perspective):** Key functions match the Space Pro’s user-visible set — LDAC, ANC, and wired listening (AUX). Wave Pro’s ANC performance has third-party confirmation; Space Pro’s ANC is a manufacturer spec at −47dB without independent lab data. Given feature parity and the available measurements, we treat them as functionally equivalent for CP purposes. [1][2]

**Calculation (policy formula):**  
CP = MIN(1.0, *cheapest equivalent price* ÷ *review target price*)  
= MIN(1.0, **79.99 USD ÷ 79.99 USD**) = **1.0**.

**Note:** After surveying current market options, we did not find a cheaper model that simultaneously offers **ANC + LDAC + wired listening (USB or 3.5mm)** in a finished product. If a lower-priced, truly equivalent model appears with verified measurements, the CP score should be revisited. [2][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

SoundPEATS provides a 12-month warranty and typical online retail support. Long-term firmware cadence is average for this segment. Battery longevity claims (151h) depend on use conditions and will require time-in-market to validate. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product emphasizes headline features (very long stated battery life, −47dB ANC, LDAC) over disclosed, independently validated acoustic performance metrics. Absent third-party FR/THD data, the design reads as feature-first rather than measurement-first.

## Advice

If you want **third-party-measured ANC** at the same price point and **wired listening**, the EarFun Wave Pro is an immediate peer option. If you value a broader ecosystem or app features, also consider mainstream alternatives around 80–100 USD; however, many drop **either LDAC or wired listening** at this budget. [2][3][4]
