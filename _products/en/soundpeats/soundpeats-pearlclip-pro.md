## Overview

The SoundPeats PearlClip Pro is an open-ear clip-style Bluetooth earphone released in 2025. It features 12mm dual magnetic drivers and adopts an ear-hook design that combines titanium-nickel alloy memory wire with liquid silicone materials. With IPX5 waterproof specifications and weighing only 5.85g per side for lightweight performance, it offers 6 hours of continuous playback and 24 hours of usage including the charging case. The product received the VGP2025 Best Cost Performance Award and entered the open-ear market at approximately 47 USD price point.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

According to RTINGS measurements, the open-fit design provides no acoustic isolation performance, and bass is severely limited by physical constraints. Large peaks exist between high and mid-low frequencies, causing voice to sound harsh and honky. THD measurements confirm distortion, and the microphone's THD performance shows unmeasurable problem levels. Frequency response significantly deviates from ±3dB, and even considering the physical constraints of open-ear design, sound quality transparency is not achieved. Multiple indicators falling into problem levels indicate limited scientific sound quality improvement effects.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The combination of 12mm dual magnetic drivers and PU+nickel-plated diaphragm represents an appropriate design choice for this price range. The adoption of titanium-nickel alloy memory wire mounting mechanism and 70% liquid silicone material shows a rational approach to physical constraints in open-ear design. Bluetooth 5.4 support and dynamic EQ processing achieve optimization within a limited budget. However, no fundamental technological innovations or proprietary technologies exceeding industry standards are observed, remaining at standard implementation through combination of existing technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Against the current market price of approximately 47 USD, the cheapest product with equivalent functions is the Anker Soundcore C30i (approximately 43 USD). The calculation 43 USD ÷ 47 USD = 0.91 would result in a 0.9 evaluation when rounded, but considering that the C30i has slight advantages in battery life (30 hours vs 24 hours) and mounting stability, an evaluation of 0.6 is given. Compared to the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (264 USD), it offers significant cost advantages and represents a rational choice for budget-conscious users.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

SoundPeats has limited market track record as an emerging manufacturer, with insufficient long-term reliability data. The IPX5 waterproof specification can handle sweat during exercise and light rain, but specific information about the manufacturer's repair system and parts supply system is not publicly available. The warranty period is at industry standard level, but details of the global support system are unclear. While it's at a reasonable level considering the price range, reliability for long-term use remains unknown.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

It adopts a rational approach that recognizes physical constraints in open-ear design and seeks optimization within those constraints. Efforts to improve sound quality under constrained conditions are evident, such as balancing lightweight design with mounting stability through titanium-nickel alloy, and bass reinforcement through dynamic EQ. However, open-ear design fundamentally has physical limitations in acoustic isolation performance and bass reproduction capability, making it difficult to achieve sound quality transparency compared to closed designs. The significance as dedicated equipment is limited to specific applications requiring situational awareness during exercise, and for general music listening purposes, it is inferior to combinations of general-purpose devices with high-performance earphones.

## Advice

The SoundPeats PearlClip Pro should be evaluated as a product specialized for exercise applications where situational awareness is important, such as running and cycling. The price of 47 USD is competitive within the same category, and lightweight design and mounting stability reach practical levels. However, the scientific performance of sound quality is far from transparent level, and it cannot be recommended for users who prioritize music listening in quiet environments or call quality. Sound leakage is unavoidable, so use on public transportation is inappropriate. This product is recommended only for budget-conscious users who want to balance situational awareness during exercise with basic music playback functions, and users seeking their first open-ear experience. For higher sound quality, it is recommended to significantly increase the budget and consider the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (264 USD), or limit the use case and choose conventional closed-type high-performance earphones.
