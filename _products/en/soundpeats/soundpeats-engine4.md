## Overview

The SoundPEATS Engine4 is a true wireless earbuds featuring coaxial dual dynamic drivers. Its unique design combines a 10mm woofer and 6mm tweeter, achieving Hi-Res Audio Wireless certification. While delivering LDAC support, Bluetooth 5.3, and 43-hour extended playback, the product stands out with its 8,480 yen price point. SoundPEATS, established in 2010 as an audio equipment specialist, has consistently developed high cost-performance products, with the Engine4 continuing this legacy.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The frequency response is specified at 20Hz-40kHz, covering the audible range. The coaxial dual driver configuration allows the 10mm woofer to handle low frequencies while the 6mm tweeter covers high frequencies, expected to improve frequency separation compared to single-driver designs. LDAC support enables high-quality transmission up to 990kbps, with the LDAC codec itself showing excellent THD measurements at 0.001% levels. However, detailed measurement data specific to this product (THD, SNR, IMD, etc.) is not available in public information, presenting challenges to complete scientific verification. IPX4 water resistance ensures stability for daily use.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The coaxial dual driver design differs from typical parallel arrangements and is expected to improve phase coherence through technical innovation. Bluetooth 5.3 and LDAC support apply current-generation wireless audio technology. The proprietary driver configuration and Hi-Res Audio Wireless certification demonstrate technical commitment, though it remains at standard levels compared to industry-leading standards. Additional features like 70ms low-latency mode and multipoint connection are implemented, placing technical specifications above industry average. However, the absence of ANC limits technical complexity.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

At the current price of 8,480 yen, comparison with competing products of equivalent functionality shows excellent cost-performance. Competing products with LDAC support and dual drivers include the EarFun Air Pro 4 (9,990 yen) and Anker Soundcore Space A40 (approximately 8,000 yen). Comparison with EarFun Air Pro 4 yields 9,990 yen รท 8,480 yen = 1.18, showing superiority, while Space A40 at 8,000 yen รท 8,480 yen = 0.94 presents a slightly cheaper alternative. Despite lacking ANC functionality, it achieves equivalent or superior performance in core functions: audio transmission (LDAC), driver configuration (dual), and playback time (43 hours), delivering overall excellent cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

SoundPEATS, established in 2010, has 14 years of experience as an audio equipment specialist with global operations. Product warranty is set for standard periods, with established support systems in Japan. However, as an emerging brand, there remains uncertainty regarding long-term reliability and support continuity compared to established manufacturers. IPX4 water resistance ensures a certain level of durability for daily use, but specific reliability data such as failure rates and MTBF are not publicly available. The support system is evaluated at industry average levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates rationality by focusing on elements directly contributing to audio quality improvement. The approach of pursuing high audio quality within limited pricing through coaxial dual drivers and LDAC support is based on scientific principles. The decision to omit additional features like ANC and touch controls while concentrating resources on battery life (43 hours) and audio quality represents a rational approach addressing users' essential needs. The design premise of LDAC utilization with Android devices clearly defines the target user base, which is commendable. The design philosophy of eliminating unnecessary functions and specializing in core performance achieves both transparent-level audio quality and price disruption.

## Advice

The SoundPEATS Engine4 is an optimal choice for Android device users prioritizing high audio quality and cost-performance. LDAC support maximizes utilization of high-quality streaming services like Spotify and Amazon Music HD. The coaxial dual driver configuration delivers excellent audio separation for the 8000 yen price range. However, those requiring ANC functionality or prioritizing call quality should consider higher-end models like the EarFun Air Pro 4 or Anker Space A40. The 43-hour extended playback eliminates frequent charging needs, providing significant daily use advantages. For iPhone users, LDAC cannot be utilized, making it unsuitable for Apple product users. For Android users prioritizing audio quality and cost-performance above all else, this represents the most rational choice currently available in the market.
