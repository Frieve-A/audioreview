## Overview

The SoundPEATS Air5 Pro is a true wireless earbud featuring adaptive ANC, 10 mm composite bio-diaphragm drivers, and Qualcomm QCC3091. It supports aptX Lossless, LDAC, LC3 (LE Audio) and multipoint over Bluetooth 5.4. Single-earbud weight is 4.8 g. Playtime is up to **7.5 hours per charge** and **37 hours total** with the case. Current US market price is **79 USD**. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

- **ANC (manufacturer)**: up to **55 dB** noise reduction (AI adaptive hybrid ANC). Independent lab ANC depth data for this model has not been consolidated as of August 17, 2025. [1]  
- **Codecs (manufacturer)**: supports **aptX Lossless (up to 1.2 Mbps)**, **aptX Adaptive**, **LDAC**, **LC3**, AAC, SBC. [1]  
- **Battery (manufacturer)**: **7.5 h** per bud, **37 h** with case; 10-min quick charge ≈ 2 h playback. [1]  

Numbers above reflect official specs; third-party full measurement datasets (FR/THD/ANC depth vs. frequency) remain limited. Representative hands-on reviews confirm feature operation but note that real-world endurance depends on codec/ANC usage. [3][4][5]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

QCC3091 delivers current-gen Snapdragon Sound features with broad codec support (aptX Lossless, LDAC, LC3). Implementation includes a 6-mic AI beamforming array, adaptive ANC, Bluetooth 5.4 with multipoint, and a 10 mm PU+PEEK driver. Integration quality and feature breadth are strong at this price. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Target price (US): 79 USD.** We searched for equal-or-better alternatives (user-facing functions & performance): **aptX Lossless + LDAC + effective ANC**. The closest widely available match is **EarFun Air Pro 4** (aptX Lossless, LDAC, adaptive ANC up to 50 dB, 10 mm driver), with a regular **89.99 USD** official store price. As of Aug 17, 2025 we did **not** find a cheaper product meeting or exceeding this functional set, so CP is capped at **1.0**. [6][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Standard **12-month** warranty and **IPX5** water resistance. Brand-level customer feedback is mixed (TrustScore **3.2/5** across 54 reviews), indicating variability in support experiences depending on channel/region. Firmware/app updates are provided via **PeatsAudio**. [1][8]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Prioritizing broad, forward-compatible wireless codec coverage (aptX Lossless, LDAC, LC3) plus multipoint is a rational approach for heterogeneous devices. Weight (4.8 g per earbud) and battery claims target daily usability. The design emphasizes mainstream, proven platforms over bespoke hardware, which typically improves compatibility and maintainability. [1]

## Advice

At **79 USD**, Air5 Pro offers uncommon codec breadth (aptX Lossless **and** LDAC) with adaptive ANC and multipoint. Choose it if you specifically want Snapdragon Sound/aptX Lossless support alongside LDAC. If you need Auracast support and a longer case-rated runtime, consider **EarFun Air Pro 4**; however, at current prices it is not cheaper than Air5 Pro in the US market. [6][7]
