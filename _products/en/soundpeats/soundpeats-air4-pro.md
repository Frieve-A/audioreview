## Overview

The SoundPEATS Air4 Pro is a budget true-wireless earbud launched in September 2023. It features adaptive ANC, a 13 mm dynamic driver, Qualcomm QCC3071, multipoint, and aptX Lossless within Snapdragon Sound. The current representative US street price is **69.99 USD** (see [2]). SoundPEATS’ US product page lists **26 hours** total battery life in the hero copy but the spec table elsewhere shows **40 hours** total; we treat **26 hours** as the reliable figure and rely on third-party battery tests for single-charge life (see below). [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

- **ANC (measured):** Independent testing reports an **A-weighted average cancellation of 9.73 dBA** with strongest attenuation below 200 Hz. A per-frequency table (30 Hz–2 kHz) is published alongside methodology, allowing a transparent, numeric comparison. This is modest but credible performance for budget ANC. [2]  
- **Passive isolation:** Average **10.53 dBA** A-weighted isolation indicates a shallow seal; high-frequency leakage remains. [2]  
- **Battery (measured):** With ANC on, aptX active, and ~70 % volume, single-charge playback is **~3 h 45 m**; aligns with multiple consumer reviews noting ~4 h real-world. [7]  
- **Specs cross-check:** Product pages confirm **QCC3071**, **aptX Adaptive/Lossless**, **Bluetooth 5.3**, **IPX4**, and **6-mic** array; codec and chipset claims are consistent across sources. [1][3]  

**Takeaway:** There are concrete, published numbers for ANC and isolation, and consistent vendor specs for codecs/chipset. The scientific picture is mixed: measurable ANC exists but is not class-leading; isolation and battery per charge are weak.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

QCC3071 with Snapdragon Sound and aptX Lossless is modern silicon for budget TWS. Adaptive ANC, multipoint, and a 6-mic beamforming array are standard 2023–2024 features. No distinctive in-house algorithms or novel acoustical architecture are evident beyond Qualcomm’s platform. [1][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Target price (US): 69.99 USD.**  
Among options with **equal or better user-facing functions and measured performance**, we did **not find a cheaper product** as of the review date:

- **EarFun Air Pro 4** (aptX Lossless/LDAC, stronger feature set): **89.99 USD** MSRP. [4]  
- **Anker Soundcore Space A40** (better ANC/battery, LDAC; no aptX Lossless): **99.99 USD** official. [5][6]

Because no cheaper equivalent-or-better alternative was identified, **CP = 1.0** per rule.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Standard 12-month warranty, IPX4 water resistance, and an app with EQ and mode control. Build and case are typical for the class. No long-term failure-rate data is available; firmware cadence is average for budget TWS. [1][3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing Snapdragon Sound (aptX Lossless) and multipoint at a low price is rational for Android users with compatible phones. The trade-offs are clear: modest ANC magnitude, shallow seal, and short per-charge endurance. The design choices target check-box modernity rather than pushing new acoustic performance boundaries. [1][2][3]

## Advice

If you specifically want **aptX Lossless** on a budget and can live with **~4 hours per charge** and modest ANC, Air4 Pro is a sensible buy at **69.99 USD**. If you value **longer battery life** and **stronger ANC**, consider **Soundcore Space A40** (official **99.99 USD**) or if you want **Lossless and LDAC** together with a richer app, **EarFun Air Pro 4** (**89.99 USD**).
