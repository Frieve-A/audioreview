## Overview

The SOUNDPEATS Capsule3 Pro is a low-cost ANC wireless earphone developed by Chinese manufacturer SOUNDPEATS. It features a 12mm bio-dynamic driver, Bluetooth 5.3, LDAC support, 43dB hybrid active noise cancellation, and achieves up to 52 hours of extended playback. Priced at approximately 65 USD, it is positioned as a product for budget-conscious users. The company has attracted attention for its cost-performance-focused product lineup.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The SOUNDPEATS Capsule3 Pro shows mixed measurement results. Regarding ANC performance, official specifications confirm a maximum noise reduction effect of 43dB, which can be evaluated as having audible-level effectiveness. However, there are significant issues with frequency response. Measurement results confirm the presence of two peaks in the midrange and a large valley around 300Hz. This causes the phenomenon of audio sounding uneven and thin. High-frequency extension is also insufficient, with low resolution clearly evident in measurements. While specific S/N ratio values are not publicly available, reviews point to low resolution, indicating it does not reach transparency levels. Bass response is in the "basshead" range, but the lack of mid-bass punch affects overall sound quality balance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This product adopts a design combining a 12mm bio-dynamic driver with hybrid ANC technology. Bluetooth 5.3 and LDAC codec support enable high-quality audio transmission up to 990kbps. The hybrid ANC design with three microphones (feedforward, feedback, and call) is relatively advanced technical implementation for this price range. Technical innovations are also seen in 70ms low-latency processing during game mode and call noise reduction functionality using six microphones. However, insufficient custom driver tuning has resulted in frequency response issues, and while technical implementation is evident, final optimization for sound quality is inadequate. The technology level is slightly above industry average, but no outstanding technical advantages are recognized compared to competing products in the same price range.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The SOUNDPEATS Capsule3 Pro is priced at approximately 65 USD. Competing products with equivalent or superior features (Hybrid ANC, LDAC support), such as the EarFun Air Pro 3 (approx. 65 USD), exist in the market. However, this product achieves a price point that is among the lowest in the market for its feature set.

Therefore, as there are no cheaper alternatives with equivalent or better features and performance, the cost-performance score is 1.0. The combination of LDAC and high-performance ANC at this price point is highly competitive in the market.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

SOUNDPEATS is a relatively emerging audio brand, and long-term reliability data is limited. While it provides a standard one-year warranty period, the adequacy of domestic repair systems and after-sales support is inferior compared to major manufacturers. Firmware updates are provided through a dedicated app, but clear information about update frequency and long-term support continuity is lacking. As a characteristic issue of Chinese manufacturers, product cycles are short, and support for older products tends to shrink after new product releases. In fact, the company releases multiple new products annually, making long-term support for individual products unlikely. Failure rate data is also not disclosed, making reliability evaluation compared to industry averages difficult, but considering the price-focused product design, it is judged to be near the industry's lowest standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The SOUNDPEATS Capsule3 Pro's design philosophy has fundamental problems. The frequency response irregularities revealed in measurement results represent a design that goes against scientific sound quality improvement. The two peaks in the midrange and the valley around 300Hz become factors that hinder accurate audio reproduction. Particularly, the phenomenon of audio sounding thin and uneven shows a contradiction of claiming Hi-Res Audio support while basic sound quality is not secured. LDAC codec support is appreciable, but if the basic driver performance is insufficient, the advantages of high-quality codecs cannot be utilized. Additionally, the contradictory tuning of applying "basshead" flavoring while lacking mid-bass punch also lacks design consistency. As a result of prioritizing cost reduction, scientific sound quality improvement has been deprioritized, showing an irrational approach that emphasizes specification numbers and feature quantity over true sound quality improvement.

## Advice

For users who are looking for both ANC and LDAC support on a tight budget of around 65 USD, the SOUNDPEATS Capsule3 Pro offers the best cost-performance. The wealth of features available at this price is a significant advantage, making it a very strong candidate if functionality is the top priority.

However, users who prioritize sound quality should be cautious. The frequency response issues identified in measurements can detract from the music listening experience. For superior sound balance and overall performance, it is highly recommended to consider spending a little more for the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC (approx. 99.99 USD).

In conclusion, this product is for the user who wants to get a feature-packed device with outstanding cost-effectiveness. As long as you don't have overly high expectations based on the Hi-Res Audio and LDAC logos and understand that the sound quality is commensurate with the price, it will be a satisfying product for those who can leverage its many functions.
