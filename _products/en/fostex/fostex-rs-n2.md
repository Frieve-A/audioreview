## Overview

The Fostex RS-N2 is a 3-way active reference monitor developed for broadcasting stations and production facilities. It features a pure magnesium hard dome tweeter, 130mm HP squawker, and 300mm HP woofer configuration, with a specified frequency response of 40Hz–20kHz ±3dB. Operating in combination with the dedicated Accuphase PRO-30(N) amplifier, it weighs approximately 75kg. It is primarily a made-to-order product for professional use; purchase and lead time require direct consultation with Fostex.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The RS-N2 specifies a frequency response of 40Hz–20kHz ±3dB, which does not reach the transparent level (±0.5dB) and sits near the borderline of the problematic level (±3.0dB). The design shows consideration for distortion reduction with features such as the pure magnesium dome tweeter. However, specific measurement data for THD+N, SNR, crosstalk, and other parameters are not publicly available, making it impossible to confirm transparent-level performance. While certain performance can be expected from its professional design, a complete evaluation of scientific validity requires actual measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design employs distinctive technologies including a pure magnesium hard dome tweeter and Fostex HP units. Many of these technologies were established in the 1990s–2000s and cannot be considered cutting-edge in 2025. In addition, using a separate dedicated amplifier chassis for an active speaker lacks integration compared to modern DSP‑integrated designs. Overall, the technology level is slightly below the current industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

As a comparator (example of a current active monitor delivering equivalent practical performance), we adopt the Genelec 8030C pair at approximately 260,000 yen. Meanwhile, used-market transactions for the RS‑N2 pair exist around 300,000 yen. Calculation: 260,000 yen ÷ 300,000 yen = 0.87 → 0.9. Even considering availability and maintenance differences, the 8030C offers strong price‑to‑performance as a modern alternative (prices vary by time and region).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Fostex is an established audio manufacturer founded in 1973 with a long track record of supporting professional equipment. The RS-N2 is designed for professional use in broadcasting stations and similar environments, so general reliability can be expected. However, as a made‑to‑order product, parts supply and repair response may require extended time, and the support system is primarily limited to professional applications. While reliability likely exceeds industry standards, accessibility constraints exist.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design shows rational technology investment aimed at achieving transparent levels, with efforts toward distortion reduction and frequency response improvement based on scientific principles. The design philosophy targeting accurate sound reproduction for professional use is scientifically grounded. However, it lacks modern DSP technology and room correction capabilities, and as an active speaker, the design lacks integration. The sales policy that completely excludes the individual market limits opportunities for market expansion and prevents cost reduction benefits. While technical rationality is recognized, the overall design philosophy has room for improvement.

## Advice

The RS-N2 is a technically interesting product, but as of 2025 the primary challenge is acquisition. Consider current active monitors with broad availability such as the Genelec 8030C, Neumann KH120 series, or Genelec 8040 series. The 8030C, while a 2‑way, offers Accuracy of frequency response ±2 dB (54 Hz–20 kHz), built‑in Class D 50W+50W amplifiers, and DSP. Evaluate based on application, room, and availability (pricing varies by region and time).
