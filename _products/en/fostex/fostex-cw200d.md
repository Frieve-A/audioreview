## Overview

The Fostex CW200D is a sealed, music-focused active subwoofer using a 20 cm (8-inch) BKP/Kevlar cone driven by a 150 W (JEITA, 4 Ω) PWM amp in a compact 13.1 kg enclosure. It provides line-level inputs plus a balanced high-level (BTL-safe) input and adjustable low-pass/phase. The model is **discontinued** and current availability is limited to remaining inventory through marketplace sellers [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No independent lab measurements were located; therefore scoring starts from the neutral baseline. Manufacturer specifications state a playback band of **20–220 Hz (–10 dB at LPF 150 Hz)** and maximum output sound pressure of **100 dB @ 60 Hz** and **85 dB @ 30 Hz** (free-field; +6 dB on the floor). Amplifier rating is **150 W (JEITA 4 Ω)**. These are catalog figures pending third-party verification [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Conventional sealed acoustic-suspension cabinet with mixed 18 mm CE plywood + MDF baffle, 0.9 T motor, and PWM amp. Balanced high-level input engineering for BTL compatibility is competent, but there’s little that advances the state of the art versus current designs [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Cheapest equal-or-better comparator: **RSL Speedwoofer 10E**—equipped with line inputs, variable LPF/phase, and **26–250 Hz (±3 dB)** response with a **300 W RMS** amp; independent measurements confirm strong output for the class [3][4].  
CP calculation (USD for both articles): **339 USD ÷ 732 USD = 0.46 → 0.5** (rounded to one decimal). The CW200D price reflects a currently verifiable new-in-box marketplace listing because the model is discontinued [7].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Fostex is an established brand and lists a U.S. distributor (American Music & Sound), but CW200D itself is discontinued; support will depend on regional service and seller terms. The Japanese manual notes a one-year warranty domestically; firmware is not applicable to this analog design [2][6].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A sealed cabinet prioritizes accuracy and integration, a reasonable choice for music use, but given the modest rated output and –10 dB bandwidth spec, the overall design goal is conservative versus modern competitors delivering deeper, louder, and better-documented performance at lower prices [3][4][5].

## Advice

If you specifically want a compact sealed sub for 2-channel music and value the CW series aesthetic or the balanced high-level input, the CW200D can serve—subject to the realities of discontinued status and limited published data. For most buyers, **RSL Speedwoofer 10E** (339 USD) or a sealed option like **SVS SB-1000 Pro** (20–270 Hz ±3 dB; 599.99 USD) will offer stronger, independently documented performance and better long-term value [3][4][5].
