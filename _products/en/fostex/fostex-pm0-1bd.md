## Overview

The PM0.1BD is an ultra-compact active speaker featuring a 3-inch full-range driver and a 15W+15W Class-D amplifier. It supports Bluetooth 5.0 (SBC) and analog AUX inputs and began shipping in June 2024 for personal/desktop scenarios [1][7][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs indicate a **110Hz–20kHz** response and **15W+15W** amplification [1][2]. The 110Hz lower limit omits much of the musically important bass range, and the single 3" driver plus small enclosure inherently constrain maximum output and low-frequency extension. Bluetooth codec support is **SBC only** (no aptX/LDAC) [1]. No independent lab measurements (THD, SNR, max SPL) are published yet.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Implementation is competent but conventional: single full-range driver, entry-level Class-D power, Bluetooth 5.0 with SBC only [1][2]. The wooden enclosure and separated amplifier section are thoughtful touches, but there is little in terms of cutting-edge engineering.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Comparator rule**: pick the **cheapest** product with **equal-or-better user-visible functions and performance**.

**Chosen comparator**: **M-Audio BX3BT**—Bluetooth input, analog I/O, **two-way** design (3.5" woofer + 1" tweeter), **80Hz–22kHz** response, rear-panel EQ; these are **equal-or-better** vs PM0.1BD [4][5].  

**Market prices**: PM0.1BD **249.99 USD** [3]; BX3BT **129 USD** [5].  
Resulting CP score: **0.5**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Fostex has longstanding pro/consumer experience and typical warranty/service coverage. While long-term field data is not yet available for this model, the simplified architecture can reduce potential failure points [1][7].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design prioritizes **size and convenience** for near-field listening. However, a single full-range driver with a 110Hz low-end limit is a clear trade-off against **high-fidelity** goals—important bass fundamentals (e.g., kick/bass) sit well below this cutoff [1][2]. SBC-only wireless further limits fidelity potential.

## Advice

If you need a **tiny, wireless-capable** stereo setup on a desk, the PM0.1BD is practical. For better accuracy and bandwidth at a lower price, the **M-Audio BX3BT (129 USD)** is a stronger choice given its two-way design and wider response [4][5].
