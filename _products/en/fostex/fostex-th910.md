## Overview

The Fostex TH910 is a closed-back over-ear headphone released in early September 2025, succeeding the TH900 series. It features newly developed 50mm elements with improved edge design intended to deliver more stable amplitude characteristics. The construction combines lightweight magnesium alloy structural components with hard maple wood housing finished in traditional Japanese lacquer featuring a unique "foil ground pattern" using silver foil. Technical specifications include 25Ω impedance, 100 dB/mW sensitivity, and extended frequency response from 12.5Hz to 45kHz. At approximately 385g, the TH910 incorporates new ear pad design with two-layer memory foam and sheepskin materials for the headband and head pad.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. While manufacturer specifications list basic parameters including 25Ω impedance, 100 dB/mW sensitivity, and 12.5-45kHz frequency response range, critical audio quality measurements are unavailable. No credible third-party measurement data exists for frequency response deviation, harmonic distortion (THD/THD+N), signal-to-noise ratio, crosstalk, or passive sound isolation performance. The claimed "tight bass response, clear midrange, and smooth high-end sound quality" lacks supporting measurement verification. When credible third-party measurements are unavailable and even manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information, the framework assigns a neutral 0.5 score representing inability to evaluate rather than actual performance assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The TH910 demonstrates solid technological implementation through proprietary audio technology with improved edge design representing Fostex's in-house engineering development. Magnesium alloy structural components offer 20% weight reduction compared to aluminum while maintaining structural integrity, showing rational materials engineering. The new ear pad design incorporating two-layer memory foam represents incremental comfort improvements. However, the core technologies remain contemporary rather than cutting-edge, utilizing established acoustic and engineering principles. While the traditional Japanese lacquer finish with silver foil pattern showcases aesthetic craftsmanship, it contributes minimally to technological advancement. The combination of proprietary audio technology and in-house design elevates the score above average, though without breakthrough innovations that would merit higher evaluation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The TH910 is priced at 2,799 USD and offers closed-back design for passive isolation, standard 3.5mm and 6.3mm connectivity, and specifications including 25Ω impedance and 100 dB/mW sensitivity. The Audio-Technica ATH-M40x at 99 USD provides equivalent-or-better functionality with closed-back design, similar 35Ω impedance for comparable drivability, and measured specifications. Equipped with similar connectivity and passive isolation features, and frequency response (15Hz–24kHz), sensitivity (98 dB, measured at 114.0 dB SPL), and professional studio monitoring capabilities are equivalent-or-better. CP = 99 USD ÷ 2,799 USD = 0.035.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Fostex provides comprehensive support infrastructure including dedicated maintenance and repair inquiry system through online contact forms with specified business hours. The manufacturer offers software downloads, accessible manuals, and compliance certificates through their support portal, demonstrating established customer service capabilities. Multiple support channels across digital platforms indicate solid infrastructure for product assistance. As an established audio manufacturer, Fostex brings industry experience and track record to reliability expectations. However, specific warranty period for the TH910 remains unannounced, and actual failure rate data is limited due to recent product launch. The support infrastructure and manufacturer reputation provide positive indicators while limited long-term data requires conservative evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design philosophy emphasizes traditional craftsmanship over measurement-focused scientific development, reflected in the company tagline "音は心の広がり" (Sound is the expansion of the heart) that prioritizes emotional and subjective aspects. Premium materials including hard maple wood housing and traditional Japanese lacquer finish represent significant cost investment without demonstrated measurement benefits or audible performance justification. Product descriptions focus on subjective sound characteristics like "tight bass, clear midrange, smooth high-end" without supporting measurement data or scientific verification. While magnesium alloy structural components demonstrate rational weight reduction engineering, the overall approach lacks the measurement-focused scientific rationality emphasized in contemporary audio development. The philosophy appears to target traditional audio enthusiast preferences rather than pursuing objectively measurable performance improvements, resulting in below-average rationality scoring.

## Advice

The Fostex TH910 represents a premium headphone targeting enthusiasts who value traditional Japanese craftsmanship and aesthetic appeal. Potential purchasers should await independent measurement data before making decisions, particularly regarding frequency response characteristics, distortion performance, and passive isolation effectiveness. At 2,799 USD, the TH910 commands significant premium over alternatives like the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x at 99 USD with similar impedance characteristics and published measurement data including professional studio monitoring capabilities. Those prioritizing objective measurement performance should consider alternatives with published third-party data and verified specifications. Buyers attracted to Fostex's traditional approach and premium materials may find appeal, though scientific validation of claimed sound improvements requires independent testing. The recent market launch provides opportunity for thorough third-party evaluation as measurement data becomes available.
