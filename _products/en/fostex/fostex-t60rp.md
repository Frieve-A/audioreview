## Overview

The Fostex T60RP is a semi-open planar magnetic headphone featuring the company's proprietary Regular Phase (RP) diaphragm technology. Designed for professional monitoring applications, it employs 40mm square RP elements with polyimide film and copper foil etching housed in machined African mahogany shells. With 50-ohm impedance and 92dB/mW sensitivity, the T60RP targets users seeking planar magnetic sound reproduction in a semi-open configuration. However, the product has been discontinued, affecting long-term availability and support.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Multiple independent measurements reveal significant performance issues that place the T60RP below acceptable thresholds for transparent audio reproduction. Reference Audio Analyzer and SoundStage Network measurements confirm frequency response deviations exceeding ±3dB across the audible spectrum, with Major HiFi documenting broad ±4dB variations including problematic boosts at 40Hz and substantial cuts at both 650Hz and 1.5kHz [1]. SoundStage Network measurements show an atypical peak at 1.3kHz where most well-performing headphones exhibit dips, alongside "pretty high" total harmonic distortion in the bass region indicating THD levels likely exceeding the 0.5% problematic threshold for headphones [2]. These combined measurement defects place the T60RP at problematic performance levels requiring significant score reduction.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Fostex demonstrates solid technical competency through their proprietary Regular Phase diaphragm implementation, representing legitimate innovation in planar magnetic design. The polyimide film with precision copper foil etching shows engineering sophistication, while the company's extensive OEM manufacturing heritage since 1948 provides substantial accumulated expertise in transducer development [3]. The neodymium magnet system with wide frequency reproduction capabilities reflects contemporary planar magnetic implementation. However, the technology represents mature rather than cutting-edge advancement, with similar approaches now widely adopted across the planar magnetic headphone market.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

CP = 99 USD ÷ 300 USD = 0.33

The Audio-Technica ATH-M40x at 99 USD serves as the primary comparison target, offering closed-back enclosure with superior measured performance [4]. Per RTINGS measurements, the ATH-M40x achieves 0.3-0.54% Weighted Harmonic Distortion, frequency response accuracy with standard errors below 2.97dB, and 0.62dB measurement consistency, demonstrating objectively superior performance compared to the T60RP's ±4dB deviations, 40Hz boost, and substantial cuts at 650Hz and 1.5kHz. The ATH-M40x achieves more accurate acoustic reproduction at approximately one-third the T60RP's original retail price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The T60RP provides only a 1-year parts and labor warranty, falling short of the typical 2-year industry standard [5]. Product discontinuation significantly impacts long-term viability, though some distributors maintain limited parts inventory for essential components like cables and ear pads. Fostex offers regional technical support through authorized distributors globally, but the discontinued status creates uncertainty regarding future parts availability and repair services. The robust planar magnetic construction with minimal moving parts provides inherent reliability advantages, though the mahogany housing may be susceptible to environmental damage over extended periods.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Fostex demonstrates rational engineering principles through their measurement-focused approach to accurate sound reproduction, particularly evident in their professional monitor heritage. The adoption of planar magnetic technology represents scientifically sound design decisions based on technical advantages rather than marketing trends [6]. The proprietary RP diaphragm technology contributes meaningfully to transducer performance and represents legitimate innovation. However, aesthetic choices like machined African mahogany housing add significant manufacturing costs without contributing to measured acoustic performance. The conservative design approach, while ensuring reliability, may limit competitive advancement in rapidly evolving planar magnetic markets.

## Advice

The Fostex T60RP cannot be recommended for new purchases due to discontinuation status and superior alternatives available at lower prices. Users seeking planar magnetic headphones should consider the HiFiMAN HE400SE, which provides objectively better measured performance at one-third the cost. Existing T60RP owners may find value in the robust construction and distinctive sound signature, but should secure spare parts while still available. For professional monitoring applications requiring neutral frequency response, alternatives with flatter measured performance curves would better serve accuracy requirements. The mahogany aesthetic may appeal to some users, but this premium should be weighed against the measured performance limitations.
