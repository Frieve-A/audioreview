## Overview

The FE208SS-HP is a 20 cm (8") full-range unit featuring an HP (Hyperbolic Paraboloid) diaphragm with a cellulose-nanofiber/mica mixed coating layer, an external dual-ferrite motor with a copper cap and T-pole piece, and UDRT (Up-Down Roll Tangential) surround/spider. It launched as a limited release at **¥55,000 (incl. tax) per unit** and is **now discontinued**. Key published data: 8 Ω, **94.5 dB (1 W/1 m)**, **fs = 32 Hz**, **Qts = 0.17**, **Vas = 96.38 L**, **Mms = 15.1 g**, **Bl = 10.74 N/A**, response **fs–23 kHz**. Uses Faston 205 gold-plated terminals and an aluminum die-cast frame.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No independent lab set covering on/off-axis frequency response, distortion (THD/IMD), directivity, and large-signal linearity (e.g., Klippel LSI) has been published; thus the baseline stays at **0.5**. The maker discloses full T/S (Re = 7.2 Ω, Le = 0.14 mH, fs 32 Hz, Qts 0.17, Vas 96.38 L, SPL 94.5 dB) and on/30°/60° curves, which helps transparency but does not substitute for third-party verification.

### Key numbers vs. rival (excerpt)

| Item | FE208SS-HP | Dayton PS220-8 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Format | 8″ full-range (HP cone) | 8″ full-range |
| Nominal Z | 8 Ω | 8 Ω |
| Sensitivity | **94.5 dB (1 W/1 m)** | **96.5 dB (2.83 V/1 m)** |
| Band (spec) | fs–23 kHz | 40–25 kHz |
| fs | **32 Hz** | 46.4 Hz (meas.) |
| Qts | 0.17 | 0.38 (meas.) |
| Bl | 10.74 N/A | 7.47 N/A (Klippel) |
| Xmax | — (n/a) | 4.8 mm (Klippel) |
| Public measurements | Maker T/S & on/off-axis FR | FRD/ZMA + **Klippel LSI** |

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Materials/process and motor details (nanofiber-mixed coating, copper-capped dual-ferrite motor, T-pole flux shaping), UDRT geometry, and dovetail-less direct leads (mass symmetry at 180°) constitute an advanced full-range implementation aimed at resonance dispersion and current-induced distortion reduction.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Comparator (cheapest with equal-or-better functionality & published measurements):** **Dayton Audio PS220-8**. Street price **163.98 USD**. Publishes FRD/ZMA and **Klippel LSI**.  
FE208SS-HP price **¥55,000**. With a mid-market **USD/JPY ≈ 147.5**, **¥55,000 ≈ 373 USD**.  
**CP ratio** = 163.98 USD / 373 USD ≈ **0.44** → **0.4**.  
Sensitivity and HF extension favor PS220-8; FE208SS-HP’s lower **fs (32 Hz)** is a countervailing strength, but the lack of independent full measurement puts it at a value disadvantage.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Fostex provides documentation and support, but **limited-run and discontinued status** introduces parts/availability risk. No extended-warranty/failure-rate data found. Physical build (gold-plated Faston, die-cast frame) is solid.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design aligns with acoustic first principles: increase stiffness-to-mass, disperse modal resonances, and linearize the motor. However, premium pricing without independent verification tempers claims of technical supremacy.

## Advice

If you value Japanese engineering craft and a limited-run concept, FE208SS-HP is attractive—but given **discontinued** status and the price gap versus **PS220-8** (with robust published measurements), most builders should prioritize the latter unless collecting or aiming for specific horn alignments that exploit FE208SS-HP’s lower fs.
