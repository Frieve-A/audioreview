## Overview

The Fostex P802‑S is an ultra-compact 2-way bass reflex speaker combining an 8cm woofer with a 20mm soft dome tweeter. Designed with a "small volume audio" concept, it supports Hi-Res audio sources through high-frequency reproduction up to 40kHz. Its extremely compact dimensions of 100×195×120mm are intended for use in limited spaces such as behind PC monitors. The speaker employs a UFLC soft dome diaphragm tweeter and wood pulp cone paper woofer, achieving a lightweight design of 1.1kg per unit.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The nominal frequency response of 150Hz-40kHz falls below the problem level range (20Hz-20kHz ±3.0dB) in the measurement results reference table. Since actual measurement data is unavailable, evaluation is limited to catalog specifications, but the high low-cut frequency of 150Hz theoretically risks omitting important low-frequency components in typical music reproduction. The output sound pressure level of 80dB/W (1m) is a standard value. While 40kHz compatibility is a specification feature, the practical effectiveness in the range exceeding human audible range (20kHz) is difficult to evaluate without measurement data. The physical constraints of the 8cm woofer suggest limitations in achieving transparent-level measurement performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The UFLC soft dome diaphragm technology aims for weight reduction and improved internal loss, but it is an already established technology in the industry and lacks uniqueness. The adoption of wood pulp cone paper is also a common approach. While the 40kHz high-frequency extension is commendable as a technical effort, it remains within design optimization under the physical constraints of an 8cm woofer, showing no innovative technological breakthroughs. The bass reflex port design also uses standard techniques, placing it at an industry-average technical level. Information on proprietary technologies and unique designs is limited, and no supporting technical papers were confirmed.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against the market price of 176 USD, the Creative Pebble Pro (59 USD) is available as the cheapest current product with equivalent or superior functionality. Calculation: 59 USD ÷ 176 USD = 0.34, rounded to 0.3. The Edifier G2000 (85 USD) is also a viable option that supports gaming applications. These current products achieve built-in amplifier convenience and lower prices while maintaining an equivalent compact design. Furthermore, the Edifier M60 (128 USD) with larger drivers provides superior sound quality performance at a lower price. While the P802‑S's ultra-small size has value for specific applications, it is significantly disadvantaged in price competitiveness against current products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Fostex maintains certain reliability as a Japanese manufacturer with long-standing experience in professional audio equipment. Product warranty and after-service systems maintain industry standard levels, with expected support response within Japan. However, detailed information disclosure regarding warranty periods and repair support is limited for products in this price range. Additionally, due to the use of ultra-small drivers, durability during long-term use remains uncertain compared to conventional standard-size products. Overall, it maintains a level slightly above the industry average but does not reach the highest standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The "small volume audio" concept is rational for specific usage environments, but the high low-cut frequency of 150Hz fails to meet basic music reproduction requirements. While 40kHz compatibility is a technical appeal point, resources should have been concentrated on improving the more important mid-low frequency range rather than investing in high-frequency extension beyond the human audible range. Design optimization under the physical constraints of an 8cm woofer is understandable, but given the existence of competing products that adopt larger drivers and achieve superior acoustic performance at similar price points, the rationality of this design approach is questionable. The design decision prioritizing compactness has led to significant compromises in sound quality performance.

## Advice

The P802‑S should only be considered for extremely limited applications—use in ultra-small spaces such as behind PC monitors. Considering the price of 176 USD, current products like the Creative Pebble Pro (59 USD) and Edifier G2000 (85 USD) offer equivalent functionality at significantly lower prices. Additionally, the Edifier M60 (128 USD) provides superior sound quality performance at a lower price. These current products also improve connection convenience through built-in amplifiers. Rational reasons for choosing the P802‑S are limited to cases with specific requirements for passive speakers or physical constraints of ultra-small installation spaces with no alternative solutions. For typical desktop audio applications, we strongly recommend choosing current active speakers. Basic music reproduction bandwidth performance and price competitiveness should be prioritized over Hi-Res compatibility features like 40kHz support.
