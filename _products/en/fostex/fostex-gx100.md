## Overview

Fostex’s GX100 line is a compact 2-way bass-reflex bookshelf speaker. The later **GX100BJ** variant marked the start of domestic production in Japan and pairs a 20 mm pure-magnesium ridge-dome tweeter with a 10 cm aluminum-alloy HR-shaped woofer (crossover 1.8 kHz) [1]. The original **GX100** shares the same basic architecture and official specs (55 Hz–45 kHz, −10 dB; 6 Ω; 82 dB/W/m) [2]. The series is **discontinued** and appears only on the used market, where availability and pricing vary widely [6].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

There are **no credible third-party full measurements** (e.g., spinorama, THD vs SPL) published for GX100/GX100BJ. Manufacturer specs cite 55 Hz–45 kHz (−10 dB), sensitivity 82 dB/W/m at 6 Ω [1][2]. A −10 dB bandwidth is not directly comparable to transparent ±3 dB frequency response, and the low sensitivity implies higher amplifier power requirements versus many peers. Without verified on-/off-axis response, distortion, or maximum SPL data, the audible transparency cannot be confirmed; therefore the score is set below the unknown baseline.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Positives include a 99.9 % magnesium ridge-dome tweeter, HR cone geometry, and laminated-plywood cabinetry made in Japan [1][2]. However, this remains a conventional passive 2-way without DSP or other contemporary control of directivity/response. No public patents or novel system-level implementation are evident from official materials; thus the technology level is slightly below today’s industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Denominator (review target price):** 340 USD.  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **JBL 305P MkII** powered monitor. It offers user-visible functions (self-powered monitoring, boundary/HF trims) and verified performance with controlled directivity and neutral response; manufacturer spec 49 Hz–20 kHz (±3 dB) [3], and third-party standardized measurements exist [4]. **Current lowest market price:** 149 USD (each) [5].

**Calculation:** 149 ÷ 340 = 0.438 → **0.4** (rounded to one decimal).  
Rationale for equivalence: same essential user value (accurate nearfield reproduction); equal-or-better on-axis/room-integrated response and output/dynamics are documented for 305P MkII [3][4]. (When the comparator is cheaper and equal-or-better, CP reflects the ratio above.)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The GX100 series is **discontinued** on Fostex’s official site [1][2]. New-purchase warranty/support routes are therefore unavailable; reliability data (failure rates/MTBF) is not published. Construction quality appears solid (laminated plywood, metal diaphragms), but in the absence of active support infrastructure for this model family, score is reduced.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design emphasizes rational materials (magnesium dome, engineered cone geometry) and sturdy cabinetry [1][2]. However, compared to modern active designs with DSP tailoring and measured neutrality, this passive implementation lacks mechanisms that reliably push performance to transparent levels. No unscientific claims are made; the approach is conventional and coherent, hence a neutral score.

## Advice

For buyers seeking **measured neutrality and value**, modern powered monitors such as JBL 305P MkII provide documented performance and current support at a significantly lower price point [3][4][5]. If you specifically want a Fostex GX100/GX100BJ for collection or aesthetic reasons, verify condition carefully, budget for adequate amplification (sensitivity 82 dB/W/m), and be aware that parts/service may be limited due to discontinuation [1][2][6].
