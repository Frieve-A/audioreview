## Overview

The Fostex T500A Mk III is a limited production horn super tweeter featuring a newly developed ring-shaped pure magnesium diaphragm, precision-machined solid brass horn and equalizer, and an Alnico internal magnetic circuit. Manufacturer specs list 7kHz–40kHz (−10dB), 8Ω impedance, and 104dB/W sensitivity, with a recommended crossover of ≥7kHz (−12dB/oct). Despite the premium materials and Japanese craftsmanship, independent measurements show notable deviations from these claims and practical limitations in use.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Independent measurements by Joseph Crowe show: (1) impedance sweep with a fundamental ~3.1kHz and a pronounced resonance peak at ~9.4kHz; (2) off-axis directivity maintaining a wide ~120° listening window up to 10kHz but narrowing to ~60° by 12kHz; (3) harmonic distortion with H2 = 2.74% at 10kHz for an 85dB test signal and H2 = 6.09% at 95dB; higher-order components remain comparatively low; (4) IMD around −58dB at 10kHz, worsening to ~−40dB by 20kHz; and (5) time-domain decay that largely dissipates within ~7 periods. Critically, while Fostex publishes extension to ultrasonic frequencies, the measured on-axis response meaningfully extends only to ~20kHz. These data points substantiate significant gaps between marketing claims and observed behavior, keeping transparency below expectations for a flagship super tweeter.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Premium construction—ring-shaped Mg diaphragm, solid brass horn/equalizer, Alnico magnetic circuit—reflects high manufacturing standards. However, the underlying compression driver + horn architecture is conventional, and the implementation fails to translate material extravagance into superior measured performance versus simpler, modern alternatives (e.g., planar ribbon/AMT). Net mass of ~5.15kg underscores build solidity but does not correlate with objective performance leadership.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Typical current new-retail pricing is **USD 1,262 each** (minimum order two) → **2,524 USD/pair**. As a functionally comparable add-on super tweeter with **8–40kHz** response, adjustable 8/10/12/14/16kHz crossover and attenuation, the **Aperion PST MKII Planar-Ribbon** costs **399 USD/pair**. Cost ratio (cheapest not-inferior alternative vs. target):  
```
(399 USD) / (1,262 USD × 2) = 0.158 ≈ 0.16
```
For **high-sensitivity (≈98–103dB) horn systems** where level matching is a constraint, **Aperion HST AMT Dual** (98–103dB) is the cheapest suitable within the same ecosystem at **1,599 USD/pair**:
```
(1,599 USD) / (1,262 USD × 2) = 0.634 ≈ 0.63
```
Even under this stricter sensitivity constraint, alternatives remain markedly cheaper per delivered functionality and published bandwidth. Given the T500A Mk III’s measured ~20kHz practical extension and non-trivial distortion/IMD behaviors, its price premium is not justified on performance grounds.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Fostex is an established brand and the T500A Mk III’s substantial mechanical design suggests baseline durability. However, limited production may complicate future parts/service availability relative to mass-production products. Warranty/support appears standard for the category but offers no offsetting advantage to the weak objective performance/value metrics.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design prioritizes luxury materials and traditional horn loading without commensurate measurement gains. Recommending a high crossover (≥7kHz) constrains integration flexibility compared with solutions that can cross lower and maintain dispersion. The net result looks like market positioning rather than engineering-driven audible improvement.

## Advice

Objectively, the T500A Mk III does not earn its asking price. For most systems, the **Aperion PST MKII** delivers the target functionality (8–40kHz extension, user-adjustable crossover/level) at **~16% of the T500A Mk III’s new-retail pair price**. For horn systems needing high sensitivity, the **Aperion HST AMT Dual** still undercuts the Fostex on delivered capability per dollar. Buyers who prioritize measurable performance should allocate budget to modern ribbon/AMT super tweeters with transparent, verifiable behavior and flexible integration.
