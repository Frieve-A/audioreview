## Overview

The Zhulinniao Qingluan Z4 is a metal-bodied budget in-ear monitor using a 10 mm DLC dynamic driver, detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, and two interchangeable nozzle filters for basic tuning. Typical market price is 45 USD, and specs commonly listed include 32 Ω impedance and ~106 dB sensitivity [1][2]. Build emphasizes a zinc-alloy shell with a Chinoiserie-style faceplate; the accessory set includes multiple eartips and the filter pair [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer-listed core specs are 32 Ω impedance, ~106 dB sensitivity, and nominal 10–20 kHz bandwidth, with two tuning filters [1][2]. As of the review date, we found no credible third-party lab measurements (FR/THD/IMD) specific to Z4 in major public databases, so objective assessment of audibility-relevant performance (e.g., FR deviation within ±dB bands, low THD, isolation) remains unverified. Following our rule when measurements are unknown, we start from 0.5 and note that nothing in official materials demonstrates transparent-level metrics; we will incorporate independent data once available [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A single dynamic driver with DLC coating and N52 magnets is an established recipe. The zinc-alloy shell and simple screw-in filters are solid but not novel. No white papers, patents, or disclosed acoustic metamaterial work were found to substantiate unique engineering beyond common budget IEM practice. Implementation appears competent but conventional [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Price basis (denominator): 45 USD [2].  
Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator: **7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2**—detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin, comparable usability, manufacturer THD <1 % @1 kHz, and well-documented frequency-response adherence on public databases [3][4]. Current regular US price observed: **24.99 USD** [3].  
Explicit calculation: **24.99 USD ÷ 45 USD = 0.56**, rounded to **0.6**.  
Equivalence note: Zero:2 provides the same core function (wired IEM) and shows competitive or better measured FR conformity; its published THD spec is not worse than Z4’s publicly known information [3][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Zhulinniao sells primarily via marketplaces; formal global support channels, warranty terms, and failure-rate data are not documented by the manufacturer. The metal chassis should be physically durable, but long-term reliability and after-sales responsiveness remain uncertain compared to established brands. Information asymmetry and retailer-dependent support lower confidence [1][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Using a DLC DD with simple filter swaps is a rational, low-complexity path; however, claims of “transparent sound” lack third-party verification. Material upgrades and ornate shells add perceived value but no demonstrable gains in audible metrics. The direction is sensible for the price, but without measurements it does not evidence scientifically superior outcomes [1][2].

## Advice

If you prioritize a premium metal build and included filters at a low entry price, the Z4 is serviceable. If value per measured performance is your priority, the **7Hz Zero:2** presents a stronger proposition given its documented FR behavior and lower price. Consider the Z4 chiefly for its construction and styling; for the most measurement-aligned tuning under roughly 30 USD, the Zero:2 is currently the safer recommendation [3][4].
