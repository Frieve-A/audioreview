## Overview

The WGZBLON V1 is a portable DAC/amp equipped with dual Cirrus Logic CS43131 DAC chips. Through a fully balanced 4-channel configuration, it provides both 3.5mm single-ended output and 4.4mm balanced output. Housed in a compact aluminum alloy body weighing 20g with dimensions of 57mm×27.25mm×11.43mm, it features high-resolution playback capabilities supporting PCM up to 32bit/384kHz and DSD256. The BLON brand represents WGZBLON's emerging audio brand, offering a wide range of products from earphones to DAC/amps.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance is exceptionally excellent. An SNR of 132dB and a dynamic range of 132dB (4.4mm output) significantly exceed the transparent level (105dB or higher). The frequency response is close to flat within the 20Hz to 20kHz audible range, approaching the transparent level (±0.5dB) with outstanding values. The dual CS43131 configuration enables independent left-right channel processing, which improves crosstalk and distortion. With sufficient output levels of 4Vrms for 4.4mm balanced output and 2Vrms for 3.5mm output, it can accommodate a wide range of headphones. These measured values represent scientifically grounded performance that directly contributes to audible sound quality improvements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The CS43131 is a general-purpose DAC/amp chip, and the dual configuration is a standard approach. No proprietary design or innovative technology is evident, representing a design based on existing chip combinations. While the CS43131 itself is an excellent chip, it is widely used in the industry and lacks technical uniqueness. The aluminum alloy housing and USB Type-C connection are also common specifications. Although measurement performance is good, it receives a below-average evaluation from the perspective of technical advancement and originality. Many products with similar configurations exist from other companies, and technical differentiation is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The price of 41USD is extremely competitive compared to competing products with equivalent functions and performance. It is more affordable than the MOONDROP Dawn Pro (49.99USD), which also features a dual CS43131 setup, making the V1 effectively the lowest-priced option in its performance class. Furthermore, it is significantly cheaper than the more expensive FiiO KA13 (75.99USD) while sharing the same core configuration. As a product that achieves a dual CS43131 configuration, fully balanced output, and high-resolution support in this price range, the cost-performance is awarded the highest score of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

WGZBLON is a relatively new brand, lacking a track record regarding long-term failure rates and repair systems. While the CS43131 chip itself is a proven component, detailed information about the brand's support system and warranty period is limited. As a product from an emerging manufacturer, there are concerns about reliability compared to major brands. Regarding continuous support such as firmware updates, considering the company size, questions remain about long-term support. While the physical quality of the product is considered acceptable, after-sales support is below industry average levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The fully balanced configuration using dual CS43131 is a scientifically rational approach. The design philosophy that achieves measurable performance improvements (SNR, dynamic range, crosstalk improvement) is commendable. Without occult elements or unscientific claims, the specification-focused development policy is appropriate. The practical feature selection, including support for both 3.5mm and 4.4mm outputs and high-resolution format compatibility, is also rational. While the compact design prioritization limits analog section enhancement, the market positioning strategy that achieves equivalent function and measurement performance at 41USD is excellent, representing a rational approach emphasizing cost-performance.

## Advice

The WGZBLON V1 is an excellent product in both measurement performance and cost-performance aspects. At a price of 41USD, it achieves a dual CS43131 configuration, SNR of 132dB, and fully balanced output, making it the most affordable option compared to competitors like the MOONDROP Dawn Pro (49.99USD) and FiiO KA13 (75.99USD). While offering sound quality performance on par with these competing products, its price advantage is clear. For those seeking a portable DAC/amp with a dual CS43131 configuration, the V1 deserves consideration as a primary candidate. However, since WGZBLON is an emerging brand, there are concerns regarding long-term support compared to MOONDROP or FiiO. For users who prioritize cost-performance and are satisfied with basic warranty coverage, this product can be actively recommended.
