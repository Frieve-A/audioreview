price: 299
summary: "Open-back headphone co-developed with Axel Grell. The front-oriented, angled-driver geometry aims for a speaker-like presentation; measurements show warm tilt and treble deviations with average distortion at high SPL. At its current USD 299, significantly cheaper models match or exceed its measured performance."

## Overview

The Drop + Grell OAE1 is a collaboration between Drop and Axel Grell, known for Sennheiser’s HD 580/600/650 and HD 800 series. Released in 2024, it uses sharply angled 40 mm dynamic drivers placed forward in the cups to approximate a “front-oriented diffuse-field” presentation. The concept targets a more speaker-like image via geometry rather than traditional cup acoustics.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party data shows mixed neutrality. **Target compliance (RMS deviation):** **Bass 3.30 dB**, **Mid 2.13 dB**, **Treble 5.59 dB**; **FR consistency std. dev. 0.94 dB** [1]. **Weighted harmonic distortion** is **0.25 % @94 dB SPL** and **0.82 % @104 dB SPL** (notably higher than class leaders at high SPL) [1]. Independent measurements report an **impedance peak around ~5.5 kHz**, which can exaggerate that region with **high output-impedance** amplifiers (e.g., OTL tubes) [2]. Results confirm the design’s imaging intent but also measurable departures from neutral tonality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The extreme driver angle and forward placement are uncommon in modern open-backs and executed with quality mesh and robust yokes. The approach is technically interesting, but measured outcomes prioritize spatial effect over strict neutrality; optimization appears incomplete.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**OAE1 price: 299 USD** [3].  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (function & measurement): HIFIMAN HE400SE, 109 USD** (official store) [4]. It’s an open-back, wired over-ear with **superior distortion** (**WHD 0.06% @94 dB; 0.11% @104 dB**) and **tighter treble compliance** (**RMS dev. Treble 2.52 dB; Mid 2.77 dB; Bass 5.3 dB**) [5]. Also note **Sennheiser HD 560S at 199 USD** with **very strong mid/treble compliance** (**Mid 0.93 dB; Treble 2.33 dB**) and **WHD 0.05% / 0.21%** [6].  
**Calculation**: (109 USD ÷ 299 USD = 0.365...) → **0.4**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Drop lists a 30-day return window on the OAE1 page; explicit warranty terms for this model aren’t stated there at this time [3]. Construction is simple (wired, open-back, few moving parts), so baseline reliability expectations are average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Targeting speaker-like cues by redirecting arrival angle is a rational hypothesis. However, available data shows trade-offs (notably treble accuracy and distortion at higher SPL) alongside the spatial effect, so the philosophy is interesting but only partly realized.

## Advice

If you want a wide, “in-front” image and are willing to EQ and choose a **low output-impedance** amp, the OAE1 can be fun. For neutral playback and value, **HE400SE (109 USD)** and **HD 560S (199 USD)** both measure better in key areas at much lower prices [5][6]. Avoid pairing OAE1 with OTL/high-Z sources due to the reported impedance peak [2].
