## Overview

The Electro-Voice Tour X TX1152 is a 15-inch 2-way passive speaker designed for professional audio applications. It incorporates technology developed from concert touring, featuring an SMX2151 15-inch woofer and a DH3 1.25-inch titanium compression driver. It has a power handling rating of 500W (continuous) and 2000W (peak), with directional control provided by a 60-degree × 40-degree constant directivity horn.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The nominal specifications of a 55Hz-20kHz (-3dB) frequency response, 100dB (1W/1m) sensitivity, and 133dB maximum SPL are standard for products in this class. The SMX2151 woofer is claimed to have an "ultra-low distortion" design using an FEA-optimized magnet structure and a shorting ring, but specific measurement data such as THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) are not officially disclosed. This limits an objective performance evaluation. As a passive speaker, its actual performance is highly dependent on the quality of the external power amplifier, making it difficult to guarantee consistent sound quality. Thus, its rating remains at a standard level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The combination of the DH3 titanium compression driver and the constant directivity horn is a proven and appropriate technical choice for professional use. The FEA-optimized design of the woofer is also a modern approach. However, these are combinations of established industry technologies and lack significant innovation. The passive design misses the technological benefits of DSP (Digital Signal Processing) optimization, which is standard in modern powered speakers, making the overall approach conservative.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

With a market price of around 1,000 USD, this product faces stiff competition from powered speakers that offer equivalent or better functionality at a much lower price. For example, the Yamaha DBR15, a 15-inch 2-way powered speaker with a maximum SPL of 132dB, is available for about 500 USD. The TX1152, being passive, requires a separate power amplifier (typically costing 700 USD or more) to perform optimally, bringing the total system cost to at least 1,700 USD. Since the core functional value for the user—"getting loud sound from a 15-inch speaker"—is equivalent, the cost-performance is exceptionally low. The calculation is `500 USD ÷ (1,000 USD + 700 USD) ≒ 0.29`.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Electro-Voice is a brand with a long-standing reputation in the professional audio industry, and its product reliability meets industry standards. The enclosure, constructed from a combination of plywood and MDF with an EVCoat finish, provides durability for professional use. Practical features like multiple mounting points and handles are included. While the passive design has fewer electronic components that could fail, the overall system reliability depends on the external amplifier. Warranty and support are at an industry-standard level with no exceptional features.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the acoustic engineering itself is sound, the design philosophy is questionable from the perspective of modern market trends. The passive design forgoes the many advantages that modern powered speakers offer as standard, such as DSP optimization, built-in limiters for protection, and perfectly matched amplification. With numerous powered speakers providing equivalent performance more simply and at a lower cost, the rationale for choosing a high-cost passive system is unclear for most applications.

## Advice

Purchasing this product is not recommended. For a comparable sound output and performance from a 15-inch 2-way speaker system, a powered speaker like the Yamaha DBR15 is available for around 500 USD and is a complete, self-contained unit. In contrast, the TX1152 (approx. 1,000 USD) requires an additional power amplifier costing at least 700 USD, bringing the total investment to over 1,700 USD. This budget could instead be used to purchase a pair of higher-tier powered speakers (e.g., Yamaha DXR15mkII), creating a far more capable system. Unless a passive speaker is an absolute requirement for a specific, specialized setup, most users will find that a powered speaker is a much more rational and economical choice.
