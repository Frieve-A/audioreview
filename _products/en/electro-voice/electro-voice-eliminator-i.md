## Overview

The Electro-Voice Eliminator i is a 15-inch two-way passive PA loudspeaker designed for high-output stage use. It employs RMD (Ring-Mode Decoupling) to control cabinet resonances and uses a constant-directivity horn with 60° horizontal × 40° vertical coverage. Key catalog specs are 50 Hz–20 kHz (±3 dB) frequency response, 350 W long-term power handling, 99 dB (1 W/1 m) sensitivity, and nominal 8 Ω impedance [1][2]. Retailer documentation lists a calculated maximum SPL of 130 dB and notes crossover “Power Tracking Protection” [3]. The Eliminator i family is no longer sold new at major retailers, and EV provides only archived documentation [1][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For loudspeakers, ±3 dB across the intended band is standard rather than transparent; the Eliminator i’s rated 50 Hz–20 kHz (±3 dB) places it around the middle of the pack for fidelity expectations in PA use [1][2]. Sensitivity is a healthy 99 dB (1 W/1 m), and the claimed 130 dB max SPL is consistent with a 350 W long-term system at that sensitivity, but independent third-party full measurements (on-/off-axis FR, THD, IMD) are not available. The EV datasheet includes an Audio Precision impedance plot and minimum impedance of 5.3 Ω, confirming basic electrical behavior; however, without verified distortion/linearity data we cannot ascribe audible improvements beyond catalog claims [2][3]. Given the absence of independent measurements, the score is set at the policy baseline and adjusted by known facts.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design is conventional: a 15-inch woofer plus compression driver on a constant-directivity horn. EV’s proprietary RMD is a rational mechanical approach to reduce ringing, but comparable resonance-control strategies are widespread in pro enclosures. The model predates current practice of integrated DSP and advanced protection found in modern powered PA boxes. Overall, it reflects competent, mature engineering rather than leading-edge integration [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Market reference price for the Eliminator i is 899 USD (denominator). The cheapest **equivalent-or-better** alternative we identify is the Alto Professional TS415 at 449 USD (powered, 15", 2-way, 44 Hz–20 kHz ±3 dB, max SPL 135 dB peak; integrated DSP/mixer), which meets or exceeds user-visible functions and output performance [8][9].  
449 ÷ 899 = **0.50**.

(For context, Yamaha’s DXR15mkII is a higher-tier powered 15" loudspeaker with 134 dB max SPL at 995.99 USD, but it is not the cheapest equal-or-better option and therefore not used for the CP divisor [4][5].)

**Equivalence note:** TS415 provides a 15" two-way configuration with rated FR within ±3 dB and higher max SPL than the Eliminator i (manufacturer specs), alongside integrated amplification and protection—equal or better from a user perspective [8][9][3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

EV’s archived documentation shows a five-year speaker warranty for the product family when new and emphasizes rugged Roadwood construction [2]. Unit failure-rate data are not published. Practically, the model is discontinued at major retailers, which can limit long-term parts availability [3]. As a passive cabinet, there is no firmware component to maintain; mechanical robustness is typical of EV. Netting these factors yields a slightly-above-average score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Eliminator i follows a straightforward, scientifically grounded path: constant-directivity directivity control, adequate sensitivity and power handling, and mechanical resonance mitigation via RMD [1][2]. It does not adopt modern integrated DSP or adaptive protection that could further optimize performance and convenience. The approach is rational but conservative by today’s standards.

## Advice

If you specifically require a passive 15" two-way cabinet and can source the Eliminator i in good condition, it remains a competent option grounded in sensible engineering. For most buyers, modern powered alternatives deliver superior value and practicality: the Alto TS415 at 449 USD provides integrated amplification, DSP, and higher rated output at roughly half the price, while the Yamaha DXR15mkII at 995.99 USD offers premium SPL capability and robust processing at a higher cost [8][4][5]. Factor in that a passive box requires an external amplifier and protection processing; once those are added, system-level cost and complexity often exceed powered alternatives.
