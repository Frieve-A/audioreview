## Overview

The Electro-Voice RE20 is a professional dynamic broadcast microphone that has been an industry standard in radio stations and recording studios for decades. Featuring Variable-D technology to minimize proximity effect [2], the RE20 offers consistent frequency response regardless of distance from the sound source. This cardioid microphone extends from 45 Hz to 18,000 Hz with professional-grade construction including internal shock mounting and humbucking coil for electromagnetic interference rejection [1]. As a classic choice for voice applications, the RE20 commands premium pricing at 449 USD in the current market [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be fully evaluated due to insufficient measurement data relevant to microphone category assessment. As a passive dynamic microphone, the RE20 lacks specifications for signal-to-noise ratio or equivalent noise level, which only apply to active microphones with built-in electronics. Available specifications show standard performance: frequency response extends to 45 Hz (adequate low-end extension) [1], professional impedance at 150 ohms, sensitivity at 1.5 mV/pascal, and excellent hum rejection at -130 dBm [1]. Maximum SPL is unspecified but dynamic microphones typically handle extremely high sound pressure levels without practical limits.

Compared to latest digital microphone technology in 2025, the RE20's analog approach lacks modern advancements. Current digital microphones achieve superior measured performance across multiple categories: signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 70 dB (vs unmeasured for passive dynamic mics), equivalent noise levels below 12 dB-A, and maximum SPL handling above 130 dB with built-in limiters [6]. The Audio-Technica AT2040USB provides 24-bit/96kHz digital conversion with hyper-cardioid polar pattern and 70 dB dynamic range, while DPA's CORE+ technology achieves THD <0.5% across the entire dynamic range with virtually unmeasurable distortion and frequency response within ±1 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz [6]. Digital microphones also feature real-time monitoring, zero-latency headphone outputs, and software-controllable gain staging impossible with passive analog designs. The RE20's analog design cannot match these digital performance specifications in measurable categories. Per framework guidelines for insufficient audio-quality-relevant measurement data, baseline score of 0.5 applied.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The RE20 incorporates proprietary Variable-D patent technology developed by Electro-Voice to address proximity effect in directional microphones [2]. This innovative mechanical design uses precisely engineered acoustic paths with different characteristics for high and low frequencies, creating consistent frequency response regardless of source distance [2]. The technology demonstrates high accumulation of know-how in acoustic engineering and represents in-house design capability. However, the core patents (US Patent 3,115,207 and 3,378,649) date from the 1960s [7][8], making the technology significantly outdated by current standards. The approach remains purely analog and mechanical without modern digital integration, software processing capabilities, or connectivity features seen in contemporary microphone design. While the Variable-D technology effectively solves real acoustic challenges, the decades-old implementation lacks cutting-edge advances in microphone technology and has not evolved to incorporate modern innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Electro-Voice RE320 was identified as the cheapest equivalent product with the same Variable-D technology, cardioid polar pattern, and professional build quality from the same manufacturer [5]. Detailed specifications comparison shows equivalent-or-better performance: frequency response 30-18,000 Hz (general curve) vs RE20's 45-18,000 Hz [5], identical 150-ohm impedance, higher sensitivity at 2.5 mV/Pa vs 1.5 mV/Pa [5], and same -130 dBm hum rejection level [5]. Equipped with equivalent user-facing functions including humbucking coil technology and dual-voicing switch for versatile applications, providing superior frequency response range and sensitivity specifications.

Cost-Performance calculation: 180 USD ÷ 449 USD = 0.4

Current market price for the RE20 is 449 USD [1]. The existence of the RE320 at 180 USD [11] with equivalent specifications demonstrates better value is available from the same manufacturer with the same core Variable-D technology and comparable performance characteristics.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Electro-Voice provides excellent support infrastructure with warranty periods ranging from 1-5 years depending on product type, representing industry-average coverage [3]. The company maintains a global support system with over 80% of repairs completed within 3 days and free shipping both ways [3]. Support availability extends at least 5 years after product discontinuation with fixed repair pricing including all necessary components and labor [3]. The RE20 has a proven track record as an industry standard in broadcast environments with decades of reliable service. However, natural foam degradation occurs after 20-30 years requiring periodic maintenance to prevent rattling and performance degradation [4]. Current repair costs are approximately 200 USD flat fee through authorized service centers [9].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Electro-Voice demonstrates rational design philosophy through scientifically-based approaches to documented acoustic challenges [10]. The Variable-D technology directly addresses the proximity effect phenomenon with measurable benefits for consistent frequency response [2]. The company focuses on measurement-focused scientific sound quality improvement with in-house component design for acoustic optimization, emphasizing "complete transparency and linearity" to minimize external processing [10]. Costs directly contribute to function and performance improvement through specialized mechanical engineering. However, the design philosophy remains conservative, relying solely on analog mechanical solutions without incorporating modern digital signal processing, connectivity features, or cutting-edge technologies that could enhance functionality. The approach lacks integration of proprietary technology and software advances that would position the product competitively against modern alternatives.

## Advice

The RE20 suits professional broadcast applications where its proven track record and Variable-D technology provide value despite premium pricing. Consider the functionally equivalent RE320 at 180 USD [11] for comparable performance at lower cost. For budget-conscious buyers, the Behringer XM8500 at approximately 20 USD offers basic dynamic microphone functionality without Variable-D technology. Potential buyers should factor in periodic foam replacement maintenance every 20-30 years [4] and current repair costs of approximately 200 USD [9]. The RE20 justifies its premium only when specific broadcast heritage or identical aesthetic requirements outweigh the 2.5x price difference compared to equivalent alternatives from the same manufacturer.
