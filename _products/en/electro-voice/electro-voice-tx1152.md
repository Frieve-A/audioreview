## Overview

The Electro-Voice TX1152 is a 15-inch 2-way passive speaker manufactured by Electro-Voice, a company with a long-established track record in the professional audio field. This product, part of the Tour-X series, is designed primarily for live sound reinforcement applications, supporting 500W continuous, 1000W program, and 2000W peak output. It features an SMX2151 low-frequency driver and DH3 titanium high-frequency driver, with 60° × 40° directivity characteristics, positioning it as a practical PA speaker. As a product from a brand that has established its position in the American professional audio industry, it can be expected to maintain a certain level of quality standards.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The frequency response achieves 55Hz-20kHz (-3dB) and 40Hz-20kHz (-10dB), which represents standard performance for a 15-inch speaker. Basic specifications such as maximum SPL of 133dB and sensitivity of 100dB (1W/1m) fall within reasonable ranges for PA speakers in this price category. The SMX2151 woofer incorporates FEA-optimized magnetic structure and shorting ring, claiming "ultra-low distortion," but specific THD values or third-party measurement data are not publicly available. The combination of the DH3 1.25-inch titanium compression driver and 24dB/octave crossover at 1650Hz is technically sound, but it remains unclear whether it reaches the transparent level of the measurement criteria table. Due to insufficient objective data demonstrating clear audible improvements in sound quality, the scientific validity receives a moderate evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Technically, the SMX2151 woofer employs FEA (Finite Element Analysis) optimized design and magnetic circuit shorting ring technology to improve distortion characteristics. The DH3 1.25-inch titanium compression driver is designed to balance durability during high output with high-frequency characteristics. The steep 24dB/octave crossover characteristics minimize interference between drivers and achieve smooth response in the vocal range, representing a rational design philosophy. The adoption of constant directivity horn provides appropriate directivity control. However, these technologies represent common industry approaches without particularly advanced elements. From current technical standards, this represents a solid design level evaluation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Against the current Japanese market price of 201,278 yen, competing products with equivalent function and performance include the JBL PRX425 (approximately 120,000 yen). The PRX425 features dual 15-inch configuration with 1200W RMS capability, offering superior output performance while being significantly less expensive. Calculation: 120,000 yen ÷ 201,278 yen = 0.60, rounded to 0.6 for cost-performance evaluation. Additionally, the QSC KW153 (approximately 150,000 yen) also provides equivalent or superior performance with 3-way configuration. Calculation: 150,000 yen ÷ 201,278 yen = 0.75, rounded to 0.8. Considering these calculation results and taking a more conservative estimate, the final evaluation of 0.6 is adopted. When evaluating purely on function and performance-to-price ratio excluding brand value, the TX1152's cost-performance is limited.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Electro-Voice, established in 1927 as a veteran professional audio manufacturer, maintains established reliability in the industry. Products include standard warranty periods with worldwide repair and support systems in place. The Tour-X series, with its practicality-focused design, minimizes failure risk by avoiding overly complex structures. However, in today's audio equipment market, some manufacturers offer longer warranties and more comprehensive support, making it not industry-leading. Due to the relatively simple product characteristics of passive speakers, the probability of critical failures is low, and long-term reliability can be expected. The support system can be evaluated as above industry average standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The TX1152's design philosophy adopts a conventional approach specialized for practical PA applications. Basic design decisions such as balancing acoustic characteristics and manufacturing costs through 2-way configuration, practical coverage through 60° × 40° directivity, and sufficient SPL capability through 500W continuous support are rational. The adoption of FEA analysis for magnetic circuit optimization and steep crossover characteristics can be evaluated as technical decisions leading to measurable sound quality improvements. However, from current technical standards, more advanced approaches exist, including DSP-based acoustic characteristic correction, lightweight material adoption, and modular design for improved serviceability. While competing manufacturers adopt more innovative design methods, the TX1152's design philosophy remains within conservative bounds, resulting in moderate rationality evaluation.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the TX1152, we recommend careful comparative evaluation with competing products offering equivalent functionality. Particularly, the JBL PRX425 offers higher output performance at approximately 60% of the price, making it a priority consideration for budget-conscious buyers. If you prioritize Electro-Voice brand reliability or compatibility with existing systems, the TX1152 can be an effective choice, but you should understand that it is disadvantageous in pure performance-to-price ratio before making your decision. For those seeking higher acoustic performance, we also recommend including 3-way configuration products like the QSC KW153 in your consideration range. Before implementation, always conduct listening tests in actual usage environments to confirm that acoustic characteristics match your intended application. When considering long-term use, it is appropriate to include Electro-Voice's established support system as an advantage in your evaluation factors.
