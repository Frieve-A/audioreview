## Overview

The OPSODIS 1 represents an ambitious entry into consumer audio from Kajima Corporation, a Japanese construction giant founded in 1840 with extensive acoustic architecture expertise. This 2-channel speaker system employs proprietary Optimal Source Distribution (OPSODIS) technology developed in collaboration with the University of Southampton's Institute of Sound and Vibration Research to deliver 3D spatial audio experiences using advanced crosstalk cancellation techniques. The product features a sophisticated 6-channel multi-amplifier architecture with high-performance floating-point DSP processing, housed in a rigid aluminum body measuring 382mm x 130mm x 80mm and weighing 2.3kg.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. The stated frequency response of 55Hz~20kHz (-6dB) indicates the frequency range endpoints where output drops 6dB from reference level, representing a reasonably wide operational bandwidth [1]. However, critical measurements including frequency response flatness within the passband, THD/THD+N, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, crosstalk, and intermodulation distortion remain unpublished, preventing comprehensive performance evaluation against established criteria. The absence of third-party measurement verification compounds these limitations, as only basic manufacturer specifications support performance claims. Without proper flatness specifications or distortion measurements, the system's ability to achieve transparent audio reproduction cannot be verified, requiring a neutral evaluation score pending independent measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The OPSODIS 1 demonstrates exceptional technological sophistication through its proprietary spatial audio implementation. The core OPSODIS technology represents genuine innovation based on proprietary patent technology with in-house design development, utilizing a 20-year Head-Related Transfer Function database developed through academic research collaboration with the University of Southampton's Institute of Sound and Vibration Research [2]. The cutting-edge "lossless crosstalk cancellation" methodology and frequency-dependent optimal source distribution approach represent recent technological advancement that other companies would likely want to adopt, requiring substantial time for new entrants to replicate due to the extensive HRTF database and specialized algorithm development. The advanced integration of 6-channel multi-amplifier architecture with high-performance floating-point DSP processing demonstrates sophisticated digital/circuit/software combination, representing very high technology level in the spatial audio field.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The OPSODIS 1 concluded its crowdfunding campaign on June 30, 2025, with a regular price of 499 USD [3]. This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. When comparing desktop speaker systems offering equivalent connectivity options (Bluetooth, USB-C, analog inputs) and amplification, the Audioengine A2+ at 269 USD provides comparable desktop functionality with similar connectivity, integrated amplification, and desktop form factor [5]. Equipped with similar connectivity options including USB-C and analog inputs, and frequency response of 65Hz-22kHz ±2.0dB with 95dB SNR are equivalent-or-better in measured performance aspects. CP = 269 USD ÷ 499 USD = 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The OPSODIS 1's reliability and support structure presents significant concerns for potential users. No warranty information, service documentation, or support infrastructure details are publicly available through official channels [3]. The product's current unavailability for general purchase compounds these issues, leaving questions about long-term support, repair services, and parts availability completely unresolved. The company's inexperience in consumer audio markets introduces additional uncertainty regarding appropriate support protocols for audio equipment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Kajima Corporation demonstrates highly rational design philosophy through scientific collaboration and evidence-based development approaches. The collaboration with the University of Southampton's ISVR represents commitment to measurement-focused audio development, utilizing research facilities including anechoic chamber and distributed loudspeaker arrays for validation [2]. The OPSODIS technology directly addresses scientifically valid challenges in spatial audio reproduction, specifically the complex problem of crosstalk cancellation for binaural audio over loudspeakers. The integration of advanced DSP processing and proprietary algorithms shows appropriate technology adoption focused on functional audio performance rather than marketing-driven features. The development philosophy emphasizes scientific principles over subjective claims, aligning with rational approaches to audio engineering.

## Advice

The OPSODIS 1 presents an intriguing proposition for audio enthusiasts interested in cutting-edge spatial audio technology, particularly those fascinated by university research applications in consumer products. However, potential adopters should recognize significant practical limitations. While crowdfunding pricing of approximately 499 USD has been established, the absence of general availability and support infrastructure makes immediate acquisition impossible and long-term ownership uncertain. At this price point, conventional desktop speakers like the Audioengine A2+ (269 USD) provide proven performance and immediate availability with comprehensive support. The limited frequency response specification and lack of comprehensive measurement data raise questions about basic audio performance relative to conventional speaker systems. Prospective buyers would benefit from waiting for general market availability, comprehensive third-party measurements, and clear warranty/support policies before considering purchase. Those seeking proven spatial audio solutions might consider established alternatives like software-based crosstalk cancellation systems that offer immediate availability and documented performance characteristics.
