## Overview

The Amphion One18X is a passive nearfield studio monitor released in August 2025, representing an updated version of Amphion's established One18 series. Founded in 1998 in Finland, Amphion has built a reputation for measurement-based acoustic design focused on transparent sound reproduction [1]. The One18X features upgraded tweeter technology and newly engineered crossover specifically optimized for modern multichannel production workflows and headphone translation needs. With passive studio monitors becoming extremely rare in 2025's predominantly active monitor market, the One18X occupies a unique position as one of the few remaining options in this category.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Frequency response specification of 45-20,000 Hz ±3dB places the One18X at standard level performance according to speaker evaluation criteria [1]. While comprehensive measurement data for the One18X specifically is unavailable, Audio Science Review measurements of the predecessor One18 model provide relevant performance indicators: frequency deviation ±3 dB (100 Hz — 10 kHz), maximum usable SPL 101 dB with 3% THD (100 Hz — 10 kHz), which exceeds the 1% problematic threshold for speakers [2]. Though the X-series features improved tweeter and crossover design, conservative evaluation approach applies when extrapolating from predecessor measurements. The measured 3% THD at maximum SPL places performance in the problematic range according to speaker evaluation criteria, while frequency response deviation meets acceptable standards. Assessment remains conservative due to reliance on predecessor model data rather than direct third-party measurements of the One18X.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The One18X demonstrates strong proprietary acoustic technologies including Uniformly Directive Dispersion (U/D/D) technology and fifth generation waveguide design [3]. These in-house developed acoustic engineering solutions represent desirable technologies that competitors would seek to adopt. The 1600 Hz crossover point, positioned below the critical 2-5kHz hearing range, enables seamless driver integration through the waveguide's efficiency enhancement, aligning voice coils for industry-leading phase coherence and pinpoint imaging [3]. Updated tweeter and crossover engineering for the 2025 X-series addresses contemporary multichannel and headphone translation requirements. Amphion's 27-year accumulation of acoustic design expertise since 1998 provides competitive advantages requiring years for new entrants to develop. Technology integration remains primarily analog/mechanical without digital components, representing the only limitation in an otherwise advanced acoustic implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

At 4100 USD per pair, the One18X achieves low cost-performance score due to presence of cheaper equivalent-or-better passive speakers with similar bass response capabilities in current market. Extensive market research revealed JBL Stage A190 (1000 USD per pair, frequency response 36Hz-40kHz) as the cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative with superior bass response capabilities [4]. Kenwood LS-K901 (217 USD per pair, frequency response 40Hz-100kHz) also provides equivalent-or-better performance but the higher-priced JBL Stage A190 was selected as comparison target [5]. The One18X therefore represents significantly higher cost compared to equivalent-or-better passive speakers with similar bass response capabilities, resulting in poor cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The One18X benefits from robust passive design construction with fewer potential failure points compared to active monitors, handmade Finnish manufacturing known for quality, and Amphion's established reliability track record since 1998 [1]. Standard two-year warranty coverage aligns with industry average, supported by global dealer network and manufacturer assistance in multiple regions including Asia and North America [6]. Passive radiator implementation avoids bass port-related issues while providing enhanced placement flexibility near walls. Support infrastructure operates through established dealer-based model with manufacturer backup assistance. Construction quality receives high marks due to simple passive design inherently resistant to electronic failures common in active alternatives.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Amphion's design philosophy demonstrates exceptional scientific rationality through core principle that "whatever can be achieved acoustically doesn't need to be fixed electronically" [8]. This measurement-based acoustic engineering approach directly contributes costs to performance improvements rather than unnecessary electronic complexity. The X-series updates show measurable performance progression with enhanced tweeter and crossover engineering addressing modern production workflow requirements [7]. Proprietary acoustic technologies including waveguide design and passive radiator implementation represent innovative solutions contributing to functional performance. The scientific approach to transparent sound reproduction through acoustic optimization rather than subjective tuning demonstrates rational engineering methodology aligned with measurement-based performance objectives.

## Advice

The Amphion One18X is recommended for users seeking passive studio monitors with proprietary acoustic technologies who already possess suitable amplification. The monitor's unique market position as one of few remaining passive options makes it essentially the only choice for those specifically requiring passive studio monitors in this driver size class. Professional studio applications benefit from the enhanced tweeter designed for multichannel and headphone translation workflows. However, users should be aware that comprehensive third-party measurement data is limited, requiring trust in manufacturer specifications. Those prioritizing extensive measurement verification should await independent testing data or consider active alternatives with more comprehensive measured performance data available.
