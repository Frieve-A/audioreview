summary: "Class D stereo power amplifier based on ICEpower 700ASC2 with a proprietary buffer stage. Delivers 2x 700W at 4Ω and demonstrates measured performance exceeding transparent levels (THD 0.005%, 117 dB dynamic range, damping factor 1,000). No lower-priced products were found that simultaneously meet or exceed these specifications, so cost-performance is 1.0 (best)."

## Overview

The Amphion Amp700 is a professional stereo power amplifier delivering 2x 700W at 4Ω and 2x 350W at 8Ω, housed in a compact 19-inch rack-mountable chassis. Built around the ICEpower 700ASC2 Class D module, the amplifier features Amphion's proprietary buffer stage designed to complement the Class D topology. The Finnish-assembled unit provides balanced XLR inputs, universal mains operation, and weighs just 5 kg despite its substantial power output. At 2,000 USD, it targets professional and high-end consumer markets seeking reliable, high-performance amplification.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Amp700 demonstrates excellent measured performance based on ICEpower 700ASC2 specifications. Total harmonic distortion measures 0.005%, well below the transparent threshold of 0.01%. Dynamic range of 117 dB significantly exceeds the 105 dB transparent level requirement. Damping factor of 1,000 at frequencies below 1 kHz far surpasses the 100+ standard for excellent control. Frequency response extends from 1.5Hz to 70kHz, substantially exceeding the ideal 20Hz-20kHz range. Power output of 700W at 4Ω and 350W at 8Ω provides sufficient headroom for demanding applications. However, these figures represent manufacturer and ICEpower specifications rather than independent third-party measurements, requiring conservative evaluation adjustment of 0.1 toward 0.5 per framework guidelines.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Amphion demonstrates competent engineering through their proprietary buffer stage that complements the ICEpower 700ASC2 module. The core amplification technology utilizes ICEpower's patented HCOM modulation and control technique, featuring a self-oscillating closed-loop system with MECC secondary feedback for output filter compensation. While the fundamental Class D technology represents contemporary industry standards, Amphion's buffer stage addition shows meaningful technical contribution and understanding of amplifier design principles. The implementation demonstrates technical expertise in integrating disparate technologies, though the innovation remains incremental rather than groundbreaking. Assembly in Finland suggests quality control oversight, though the core technology originates from ICEpower's established platform.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 2,000 USD, the Amp700 represents the world's most affordable option with equivalent-or-better measured performance. With exceptional measured performance including THD 0.005%, 117 dB dynamic range, damping factor of 1,000, and frequency response of 1.5Hz-70kHz, no currently available products simultaneously meet or exceed all these performance metrics in the 700W at 4Ω power class at a lower price point. The Crown XLS 2502 delivers 775W at 4Ω for 890 USD but with THD <0.5% (100x worse), SNR >103dB (14dB worse), and damping factor >200 (5x worse), falling significantly short of the Amp700's measured performance that far exceeds transparent level requirements. Similarly, high-priced alternatives like Bryston 4B³ or Benchmark AHB2 fail to simultaneously match the Amp700's combination of power output and THD/SNR/damping factor specifications. Therefore, when comprehensively evaluating measured performance and power output, no products with equivalent-or-better performance exist at lower prices, resulting in CP=1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Amphion provides standard 2-year warranty coverage against defects in materials and workmanship, with global support through established dealer networks. The service process follows a structured hierarchy: original dealer contact, local distributor escalation, and finally Amphion headquarters for unresolved issues. Class D amplifier design inherently offers high reliability with minimal moving parts and efficient thermal management. The compact 5 kg design suggests robust construction without excessive mechanical complexity. Finnish assembly typically ensures quality manufacturing standards. Support requires original sales receipt and prior authorization before returns, indicating organized service procedures. The established company history and professional market focus contribute to long-term support expectations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Amphion employs proven ICEpower Class D technology and enhances it with a proprietary buffer stage, achieving measured performance that exceeds base ICEpower specifications. The exceptional measured values of THD 0.005% (ICEpower standard specification), 117 dB dynamic range, and damping factor of 1,000 objectively demonstrate the technical contribution of the proprietary buffer stage. These measurement results scientifically verify performance that far exceeds transparent level requirements, substantiating the rationality of the design approach. The lightweight design at 5 kg and compact chassis achieve both efficient thermal management and practicality. Finnish assembly ensures quality control, while the 2-year warranty and established support infrastructure provide long-term reliability. The combination of measurement-based performance optimization and practical design demonstrates a scientifically sound approach. The only concern is marketing terminology referencing "A-class sound," but given the objectively superior measured performance, the rationality of the design philosophy itself remains exceptionally high.

## Advice

The Amphion Amp700 represents the only option delivering exceptional measured performance including THD 0.005%, 117 dB dynamic range, and damping factor of 1,000 at 2,000 USD. Combining measured performance far exceeding transparent levels with sufficient 700W@4Ω power output, it optimally serves users scientifically pursuing the highest sound quality. The Crown XLS 2502 offers 775W@4Ω for 890 USD but with measured performance of THD <0.5%, SNR >103dB, and damping factor >200 falling short of the Amp700, insufficient for applications demanding the highest level of sonic reproduction despite meeting transparent level requirements. When paired with Amphion monitor speakers, the Amp700's high damping factor maximizes speaker control, extracting maximum system-wide performance. Purchase is recommended for professional studios and high-end listening environments demanding the highest sound quality based on measured data. For users prioritizing budget while transparent level performance suffices, more affordable alternatives are available, though no currently available products simultaneously meet the Amp700's measured performance specifications.
