summary: "A wireless desktop speaker discontinued in 2016. While it features a unique single-driver design, it lacks technical superiority compared to current products, and its pricing in the hard-to-find used market is not reasonable."

## Overview

The DENSO TEN Eclipse TD-M1 is a wireless desktop speaker system launched in 2014 and discontinued in 2016. It features an egg-shaped enclosure with an 80mm single driver and supports wireless connectivity via Wi-Fi and AirPlay. The initial launch price was 1,299 USD, revised to 999 USD before discontinuation in 2016. It is now listed as a discontinued product on the official website, making new units unavailable, with limited circulation in the used market. Used market prices fluctuate significantly around 600-700 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 80mm single-driver design avoids crossover distortion, but the frequency response is claimed as 70Hz-30kHz without specified tolerances, and measurements show low-frequency roll-off. THD is 0.08% at 10W and 10% at maximum 25W, good at low output but problematic at max for speaker standards. Specific S/N ratio values are not disclosed, and dynamic range or crosstalk measurement data is limited. The NOS DAC is used, but no measurement superiority is confirmed compared to current multibit DACs. Due to insufficient measurement data, transparency level achievement is partial.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The single-driver design is a unique approach, but it fails to overcome physical frequency response limitations. The Class D amplifier was advanced at the time, but it is now standard technology in 2025. The 192kHz/24bit compatible NOS DAC supports high resolution, but its technical superiority is questionable. Wi-Fi and AirPlay are convenient, but connectivity stability may be inferior to wired options. The egg-shaped enclosure shows acoustic considerations, but it is not evaluated as innovative by industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Against the final sales price of 999 USD, the current Audioengine HD6 (699 USD) with equivalent functions (wireless connectivity, desktop size) is the comparison target. The HD6 features a 5.5-inch woofer, silk dome tweeter, 50W×2 Class AB amplifier, Bluetooth aptX-HD, optical digital input, and measurement performance (THD<0.05%, FR 50Hz-22kHz ±1.5dB, SNR>95dB) that is equivalent or better. Calculation: 699 USD ÷ 999 USD = 0.699 (rounded to 0.7). The TD-M1 is discontinued and unavailable new, with unstable used prices, but equivalent performance is achievable at lower cost with current products, making CP limited.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The product is discontinued and listed as such on the official website. Firmware updates, dedicated apps, and USB driver support are presumed ended, with no expectations for compatibility or security updates. Warranty periods have expired, and repair parts supply is difficult. While DENSO TEN continues to exist, the Eclipse audio business shows a shrinking trend, making long-term support weak.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Avoiding crossover distortion with a single driver is reasonable, but it does not resolve frequency response constraints. The NOS DAC claims analog-like sound, but measurements confirm no superiority over current digital technology and possible inferiority. Against 999 USD, current KEF LSX II LT (999 USD) and Audioengine HD6 (699 USD) offer superior specifications and functions. Discontinuation makes it hard to obtain, and used price instability is not reasonable, though basic functions as dedicated equipment are met.

## Advice

The TD-M1 is discontinued and cannot be purchased new. Even when considering used units, comparison with current products is recommended. The KEF LSX II LT (999 USD) provides superior measurement performance and modern features at the same price, while the Audioengine HD6 (699 USD) achieves equivalent or better at a lower cost. Both offer new product warranties and support. Even if interest in single-driver design is the reason, measurement performance benefits are limited. In audio selection, evaluating measurement performance, support, and future-proofing is reasonable, making current product choices advisable. Purchase is not recommended except for collection purposes.
