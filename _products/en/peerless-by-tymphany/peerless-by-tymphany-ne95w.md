## Overview

The NE95W-04 is a 3-inch (76 mm) full-range driver from Peerless by Tymphany. It features an aluminum cone diaphragm, a die-cast aluminum basket with wide openings to reduce internal reflections, a neodymium motor with copper cap and heatsinking behavior, and a titanium voice-coil former. It targets compact DIY speaker applications where a single wideband driver is desired.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specifications list Fs = 102.81 Hz, sensitivity 83.2 dB (1 W/1 m, half space), rated power 25 W (program 50 W), and Xmax = 1.8 mm [1]. Third-party aggregated data reports SPL (1 W/1 m) around 83.9 dB and a published frequency response spanning 80 Hz–20 kHz, with visible ripple above 10 kHz [2]. The total Q factor Qts = 0.72 (spec) indicates standard-to-somewhat-higher damping for this class [1]. These values suggest that transparency-level flatness (on the order of ±1 dB for loudspeakers within the used band) is not achieved; thus, the scientific validity is moderate.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The driver applies modern, rational design elements: an open die-cast basket, neodymium motor with copper cap, titanium former, and an FEA-optimized butyl surround [1]. However, the published response retains upper-band ripple in third-party data [2], indicating that the invested technology does not fully translate into measured flatness. Overall, a mid-level score is appropriate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Representative domestic prices (Japan) confirmed and converted to USD at the official rate on 2025-08-11 (ECB) are used as a global fallback per policy. Review target: NE95W-04 at 6,101.65円 (≈ 39 USD) [4]. Comparator (equivalent-or-better functions and performance): Fostex FE83NV2 at 5,500円 (≈ 35 USD), similar full-range use case with higher sensitivity published by the manufacturer [3].

CP calculation: 5,500円 ÷ 6,101.65円 = 0.9016… → rounded to 0.9. Rationale of equivalence: both are compact full-range drivers intended for similar user-facing applications; FE83NV2 sensitivity is higher, and published bandwidth covers fs–22 kHz [3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Tymphany (formerly Vifa/Peerless) has longstanding transducer know-how and generally consistent build quality. The aluminum cone with butyl surround is a durable combination. However, the recent market presence and support visibility are limited, and detailed warranty/repair pathways are not always clear. For DIY parts, a mid-low reliability/support score is reasonable.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design direction is scientific in nature (motor linearization, reflection control, thermal management) [1]. Yet, the remaining upper-band ripple in publicly available response data [2] implies incomplete optimization toward measurement transparency. The overall rationality is limited accordingly.

## Advice

For a 3-inch class full-range in DIY projects, NE95W-04 is attractive for its materials and motor design [1]. Be mindful that the published data shows ripple above 10 kHz [2]. Light EQ or a helper tweeter can smooth the top end; alternatively, use it primarily as a mid in a compact 2-way. Verify measured response for your intended enclosure and listening distance to ensure expectations are met.
