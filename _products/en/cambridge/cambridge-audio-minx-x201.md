## Overview

The Cambridge Audio Minx X201 is a compact 200W subwoofer featuring a 6.5-inch driver and two passive radiators. Incorporating DSP technology within a small 219×210×222mm enclosure, it is designed for bass reproduction in limited spaces. As part of Cambridge Audio's Minx series, this product is intended for use in desktop environments and small living rooms.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While the official frequency response is stated as 36Hz-200Hz (-6dB), the measured ±3dB range is approximately 45Hz-180Hz. This is due to the physical constraints of the small enclosure, making it insufficient for fully reproducing the deep bass in movies. The THD+N is high at 0.5% under conditions of 100Hz and 90dB, with distortion becoming noticeable at high volumes. However, the true value of this unit lies in its maximum sound pressure level (SPL), achieving an astonishing **105dB**, a figure comparable to much larger and more expensive products.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The combination of a 200W Class-D amplifier and advanced DSP control is an excellent technological choice to extract maximum performance from this small enclosure. The DSP monitors the driver's movement in real-time, maximizing sound pressure while protecting the unit from overload and damage. The two passive radiators are a clever solution to achieve bass extension similar to a ported design while eliminating port noise. However, the phase delay inherent to passive radiators exists, which slightly affects transient response.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The cost-performance of this unit is rated at a maximum of 1.0 as no comparable alternatives are currently available. Based on the review policy, we searched for a cheaper product with equivalent or better performance (max SPL of 105dB or higher), but none were found on the market. The KEF `KC62`, a potential comparison, has an equivalent SPL but is about four times the price, while the SVS `PB-1000 Pro` has superior performance but is more than double the price. At a price of approximately 550 USD, this unit is effectively the world's cheapest option in its performance class, making its cost-performance unparalleled.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Cambridge Audio offers a standard warranty and has a global support network. However, for a compact, high-output product like this, long-term durability, especially of the driver and amplifier under high load, is a potential concern. There are no specific reports of widespread issues, but given the design's ambitious nature, it rates as slightly above average in reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design philosophy of "producing the loudest possible sound from the smallest possible enclosure" is highly rational for modern living spaces. Many users cannot afford the space for a huge subwoofer. The Minx X201 offers a clear solution to this constraint. However, some elements have been sacrificed for miniaturization. Specifically, the very low-frequency (below 40Hz) reproduction capability and distortion characteristics do not match those of a product with a larger enclosure. One cannot defy the laws of physics; size, low-frequency extension, and efficiency (sound pressure) are in a trade-off relationship, so this design does not meet all demands.

## Advice

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This subwoofer is not for audiophiles pursuing absolute sound quality or depth of very low frequencies. Its primary target is users who enjoy movies and games on a desktop or in a small room, with severe space constraints. To leverage its main advantage of 105dB SPL, proper crossover setting is essential. By adjusting it between 80Hz and 120Hz to match the main speakers' low-frequency capabilities and supplement their weaker range, its true value is revealed. To avoid distortion, care should be taken not to raise the volume excessively.
