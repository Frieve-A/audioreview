## Overview

PHONON SMB-02 is a professional monitor headphone developed by PHONON, a Japanese audio brand established in 2010. It adopts the proprietary PHD (Phonon Headphone Design) concept and features tuning by veteran mastering engineer Isao Kumano. The design aims to bridge the gap between headphone and speaker monitoring, intended for studio use. Specifications include output sound pressure level of 100dB/mW, frequency response range of 20-20,000Hz, impedance of 40Ω, weight of 300g (including cable and plug), equipped with 6.3/3.5mm gold-plated screw-type stereo 2-way plug and 3m 4-wire L/R independent ground connection cable.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comprehensive measurement data disclosure for SMB-02 is extremely limited. While basic frequency response measurements via MiniDSP EARS are partially available, detailed measurement data for THD+N, S/N ratio, crosstalk, dynamic range, and other parameters could not be confirmed. The lack of objective measurement results from third-party institutions makes scientific evaluation difficult. From the published frequency response, variations of approximately ±3dB are observed within the 20Hz-20kHz range, which aligns with standard levels for headphones but does not reach transparent levels (±0.5dB). Important measurement indicators such as THD and S/N ratio remain unknown, making performance verification within the audible range insufficient.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Features PHONON's proprietary PHD concept with acoustic tuning by veteran engineers. Technical considerations include 4-wire L/R independent ground connection and gold-plated plugs for signal transmission. However, these technical approaches are not particularly innovative within the industry, and similar design methodologies are widely adopted by other manufacturers. The impedance of 40Ω and output sound pressure level of 100dB/mW fall within standard specification ranges. While promoting proprietary tuning theory, the technical basis and effects lack supporting measurement data, evaluated as average technology level by current industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

SMB-02's price of 280 USD is significantly expensive compared to equivalent competing products. Compared to Sony MDR-7506 (100 USD), a representative studio monitor product, the calculation yields 100 ÷ 280 ≈ 0.36. MDR-7506 features similar closed-back design, professional use, wide frequency characteristics, and actually demonstrates more transparent measurement results. It also has a proven track record of adoption as standard equipment in many studios. The functions provided by SMB-02 (monitoring, isolation, connectivity, etc.) can be sufficiently substituted by more affordable alternatives, and clear performance advantages that justify the price difference cannot be confirmed through measurement data.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

PHONON has a certain corporate foundation as a Japanese company established in 2010, but faces constraints in global product supply systems. Limited stock sales are frequently observed on platforms like Amazon, making stable product acquisition difficult. A warranty period of 2 years is provided in some regions, but detailed information disclosure regarding repair support is limited, and spare parts supply for long-term use remains unclear. While relatively good support can be expected domestically in Japan, the small scale of overseas expansion results in global after-service systems inferior to major manufacturers. Data on failure rates and MTBF are not disclosed, lacking objective judgment materials for reliability evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design concept of bridging the gap between headphone and speaker monitoring represents a rational direction addressing practical challenges faced by studio engineers. The approach emphasizing professional acoustic tuning also has certain significance in an audio industry that tends to rely on subjective evaluation. However, specific technical methods to achieve this goal and objective measurement results verifying their effects are insufficient. Clear differentiation factors from general-purpose equipment (such as Sony MDR-7506) are not demonstrated through measurement data regarding the necessity of existing as dedicated audio equipment. In modern audio development that emphasizes scientific verification, a more transparent approach is required.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the PHONON SMB-02, careful judgment from a cost-performance perspective is recommended. For the same studio monitor applications, Sony MDR-7506 (100 USD) or Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (169 USD) provide overwhelmingly superior cost-performance. These products have abundant published measurement data and proven usage records in many professional environments. If choosing SMB-02, it is important to conduct actual listening tests beforehand and confirm clear sound quality advantages that justify the price difference. For long-term use considerations, please verify spare parts availability and repair support systems in advance. Unless you find special value in Japanese craftsman-style audio tuning and have sufficient budget flexibility, we recommend considering more rational alternatives.
