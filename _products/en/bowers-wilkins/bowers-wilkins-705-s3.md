## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins 705 S3 is a bookshelf speaker from the company's 700 series. The current S3 generation features technology transferred from the upper 800 series, including the Decoupled Carbon Dome™ tweeter and Continuum™ cone woofer, establishing its position in the high-end audio market. As a product from the historic British audio manufacturer B&W, it incorporates the company's technical expertise and attracts attention from many audio enthusiasts worldwide.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

According to Stereophile measurements, the 705 S3's frequency response falls within a 50Hz-28kHz ±3dB window, which represents standard performance for speakers. Its THD remains below 1% from 100Hz-22kHz and below 0.5% from 150Hz-20kHz, meeting the standard values in the measurement criteria table for speakers. The sensitivity of 88.9dB/2.83V/m is good, and the impedance maintains above 5 ohms in most frequency bands with a minimum of 3.7 ohms, providing stability. These measured values contribute to transparency in the audible range, though they do not reach industry-leading levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Decoupled Carbon Dome™ tweeter achieves a lightweight structure and high rigidity through its carbon material, while the Continuum™ cone is a commendable proprietary technology from B&W. The technology transfer from the 800 series results in a high degree of design completion, and the 3kHz crossover design is appropriate. However, these are improvements to existing technologies rather than revolutionary innovations that transform the industry. As a high-quality, self-designed product, it demonstrates an above-average technical level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 705 S3's market price is 3400 USD. A competitive product with equivalent or superior performance, the KEF LS50 Meta, is available for 1600 USD. The LS50 Meta offers comparable or superior capabilities to the 705 S3 in both measurement performance and functionality at a lower price. The cost-performance score is calculated as 1600 USD ÷ 3400 USD = 0.47, which is rounded to 0.5. With an alternative offering equivalent performance at about half the price, its cost-performance is average.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While a 5-year warranty is provided for its passive speakers, customer reviews on Trustpilot report numerous problems. Issues include warranty claim processing taking over four months, a decline in customer service quality, and customers having to bear round-trip shipping costs for repairs. Some customers have noted a "dramatically deteriorated service quality," indicating a support system that falls below the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

B&W adopts a scientific approach focused on improving measurable acoustic characteristics. The choice of driver materials, cabinet design, and crossover configuration all contribute rationally to enhancing actual acoustic performance. This development approach, based on measurement data, is commendable, and no unscientific claims are observed. However, as dedicated audio equipment, it falls short of demonstrating a clear advantage over combinations of more affordable general-purpose devices, and the innovation relative to its price is limited.

## Advice

The 705 S3 is a high-quality speaker backed by solid technical expertise, but careful consideration is necessary given its price. With alternatives available that achieve equivalent performance at a lower cost, the key decision factor is whether you find 3400 USD worth of value in the B&W brand and its refined appearance. If considering a purchase, be mindful of the support system issues, conduct a thorough audition before buying, and strongly consider a comparative evaluation with other manufacturers' products. For long-term use, it is wise to include other brands that provide reliable support in your options.
