summary: "The Bowers & Wilkins 606 S2 is a bookshelf speaker featuring a 6.5-inch Continuum cone driver and 1-inch decoupled double-dome aluminum tweeter. While it achieves a frequency response of 52Hz-28kHz, cost-performance challenges arise due to the availability of competing products offering equivalent or superior measured performance at significantly lower prices."

## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins 606 S2 Anniversary Edition is a 6.5-inch 2-way bookshelf speaker from the prestigious British audio manufacturer. It combines a mid/bass driver featuring the company's proprietary Continuum cone technology with a 1-inch decoupled double-dome aluminum tweeter. With specifications including 88dB sensitivity, 52Hz-28kHz (±3dB) frequency response, and recommended amplifier output of 30-120W, the Anniversary Edition incorporates Mundorf capacitors and high-quality resistors for enhanced audio performance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The frequency response of 52Hz-28kHz (±3dB) sits at the threshold of the problematic level for speakers, with limited bass extension at 52Hz. Real measurements from Audio Science Review on the similar 607 S2 indicate high-frequency resonances and peaks around 1-1.7kHz, potentially affecting neutrality. Detailed third-party measurements for the 606 S2 are limited, but similar issues may exist. Compared to competitors, scientifically confirmed advantages in distortion and response flatness are not established.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Continuum cone technology and decoupled double-dome structure demonstrate the company's technical initiatives. The Mundorf capacitors and high-quality resistors adopted in the Anniversary Edition reflect attention to crossover design. However, these technologies fall within the range of industry-standard approaches and cannot be considered innovative. Their contribution to measurable performance improvements is limited, placing the technology level slightly above average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against the current market price of 900 USD (actual retail price on Amazon and similar platforms), the ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 (300 USD) offers equivalent or superior performance based on measurements. The ELAC provides better bass extension of 44Hz-35kHz and flatter response in real tests, featuring a 6.5-inch aramid fiber woofer and 1-inch cloth dome tweeter. Cost-performance calculation: 300 USD ÷ 900 USD = 0.333, rounded to 0.3. Equivalent functionality and measured performance options exist at approximately one-third of the price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Bowers & Wilkins, as a veteran British audio manufacturer with over 50 years of history, provides a stable brand foundation and warranty system. However, the 606 S2 has already been succeeded by the 606 S3 model and is now a discontinued product. Future constraints regarding long-term support and parts supply are anticipated. While current reliability maintains industry-average standards, there are concerns from a product lifecycle perspective.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The company's design approach is based on traditional acoustic engineering, but there appears to be a tendency to prioritize brand differentiation over measurable performance improvements. The high-frequency characteristic issues identified in related products are considered to be the result of prioritizing subjective tuning over scientific optimization. Compared to competing products in the same price range, clear technical rationality or measurement result advantages cannot be demonstrated. While the design philosophy is not unscientific, it cannot be considered efficient either.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the 606 S2, we recommend first conducting a direct comparison with the ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 (300 USD). At a price point of 900 USD, the ELAC holds advantages in bass extension, measured flatness, price, and installation flexibility (front port) across all aspects. If you have a special attachment to the B&W brand, consider investing in the current 606 S3 instead. Since the 606 S2 is a discontinued product, future support risks must also be considered. For those prioritizing audio quality, please recognize that multiple better options exist within the same budget. Based on objective evaluation using scientific measurements, this product's price-to-performance ratio does not reach recommended levels.
