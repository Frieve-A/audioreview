## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins 685 S2 is a discontinued two-way bookshelf speaker that was part of the company's 600 Series. Featuring a 6.5-inch woven Kevlar cone driver with anti-resonance plug and a 25 mm aluminum dome tweeter, the 685 S2 represented B&W's entry-level offering when it originally retailed for 700 USD. Currently available only in the used market at approximately 415 USD per pair (typical asking/sold examples cluster around 375–500 USD), the speaker uses a decoupled double-dome tweeter and other construction techniques derived from higher-end models. [1][2][6]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent NRC data reports sensitivity at **86.4 dB/2.83 V/1 m**. Manufacturer specifications list **frequency response 52 Hz–22 kHz (±3 dB)** with **–6 dB points at 45 Hz and 50 kHz**, **nominal impedance 8 Ω (minimum 4.0 Ω)**, crossover at **4 kHz**, and harmonic distortion (2nd+3rd) **<1% from 95 Hz–22 kHz at 90 dB/1 m**. Together these indicate adequate technical fidelity for a 6.5-inch passive design; however, comprehensive third-party THD/distortion sweeps have not been published for this model. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Conventional two-way vented-box design with woven Kevlar mid-bass and an aluminum double-dome tweeter mounted using a decoupled scheme. The architecture is sound but not novel versus contemporary competitors; crossover at 4 kHz is standard for this driver complement. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Price basis (review target):** 415 USD per pair (used market typical). [6]  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (new):** **ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2** bookshelf (pair) — 2-way passive with 6.5" woofer; independent measurements show **~±3.4 dB** listening-window flatness and **–3 dB ≈ 63 Hz**; official spec **44 Hz–35 kHz**, **87 dB** sensitivity. Street price **329 USD/pair**. Functions are equivalent, and measured linearity is equal-or-better; bass extension is comparable. **CP = 329 USD ÷ 415 USD = 0.79 → 0.8**. [3][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a discontinued product, ongoing manufacturer support is limited. Passive topology reduces failure points and build quality was solid, but parts availability will diminish over time; purchases rely on unit condition and third-party service.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Material choices (Kevlar cone, aluminum double-dome tweeter) and decoupling target identifiable performance goals, yet the design does not push state-of-the-art measured transparency. The product prioritized brand and construction themes over aggressive, measurement-driven optimization relative to newer rivals.

## Advice

At ~415 USD used, the 685 S2 suits listeners with existing amplification seeking a classic B&W voicing. If neutrality/linearity per dollar is the priority, the **ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2** offers a lower new price with competitive or better measured behavior; if high efficiency is required, consider models explicitly designed for sensitivity, but verify independent measurements before purchase.
