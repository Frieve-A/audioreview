price: 1000
summary: "A compact sealed 10-inch subwoofer with a 200W Class D amp and a rated ±3 dB response of 27–140 Hz. Fidelity is limited mainly by modest maximum output and the lack of onboard DSP/room tools versus modern rivals. With a current street price of 1,000 USD and a strong cheaper alternative available, cost-performance is 0.5."

## Overview

Bowers & Wilkins ASW610 is a sealed (closed-box) powered subwoofer using a long-throw 250 mm (10-in) paper/aramid fiber cone and a 200 W Class-D amplifier. The manufacturer rates frequency response at ±3 dB: 27 Hz–40/140 Hz (adjustable), with a −6 dB range down to 20 Hz depending on bass-extension setting. Dimensions are 310×310×347 mm (H×W×D, without grille) and 12.5 kg. US list price is 1,000 USD. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent comprehensive measurements (CEA-2010 output, distortion vs SPL) are scarce; therefore we rely on clearly labeled manufacturer specifications and public documentation. Within that evidence, the sealed design and rated ±3 dB to 27 Hz indicate competent bandwidth for a compact 10-inch unit, but maximum output is inherently limited versus larger/ported designs. No claims beyond what is supported by specs are made here. We will incorporate third-party data when available. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ASW610 uses a rational sealed alignment, long-throw driver, and a stable Class-D amp with standard controls (low-pass, phase, extension). However, it omits today’s common conveniences—built-in DSP, app control, or parametric EQ—which are widely adopted by peers. The engineering is solid but conservative. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Cheapest **equivalent-or-better** alternative identified: **RSL Speedwoofer 10S MKII**. It provides equal or better user-facing performance (deeper rated extension to 22 Hz in LFE mode, higher 400 W RMS power, built-in wireless receiver; 10-inch driver, modern DSP platform). Current direct price observed: **501 USD**. [4][5]

Explicit calculation (CP rule: *cheapest equivalent price ÷ review target price*):

**501 USD ÷ 1000 USD = 0.501 → 0.5** (rounded to one decimal place).  
Why equivalent-or-better: deeper published extension (22 Hz vs 27 Hz), higher RMS power, comparable cabinet size, and strong third-party coverage confirming capability for its size. [4][5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Bowers & Wilkins provides a **2-year warranty for powered loudspeakers** (passive speakers are 5 years). The brand maintains a global distributor/service network and clear documentation, which supports above-average confidence for long-term ownership. [2][3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product’s design choices (sealed box, straightforward amp) are technically reasonable and avoid occult claims. However, at 1,000 USD it forgoes integrated DSP/app-based room tools that can deliver audible improvements in-room; this reduces rationality relative to peers that allocate cost to such features. [1][7]

## Advice

In small to mid-size rooms prioritizing compactness and “tight” bass, ASW610 can integrate well—especially in pairs for smoother response. If you need **more feature depth or value**, consider **RSL Speedwoofer 10S MKII** (cheaper, deeper extension) or **SVS SB-1000 Pro** (sealed 12-inch with app/DSP; 20–270 Hz ±3 dB, typically 599 USD). Choose based on room size/output needs and whether you want built-in EQ/app control. [4][5][7]
