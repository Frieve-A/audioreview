date: 2025-08-20
rating: [2.9, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.5]
price: 1800
summary: "A vintage flagship with robust Matrix bracing and serious output capability. By today’s measurement standards it stops short of fully transparent, but measured modern towers exist that match or beat it at far lower prices—yielding moderate cost-performance at the representative USD 1,800 used price."

## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins Matrix 801 Series 3 (1992–1998) is the final revision of the famed Matrix 801 line. It’s a 3-way bass-reflex floorstander with **one 300 mm (12 in) woofer, one 126 mm (5 in) Kevlar midrange, and one 26 mm (1 in) metal-dome tweeter**. The cabinet uses **Matrix** internal bracing; the crossover is set at **380 Hz / 3 kHz**. Professional studio adoption, including **EMI/Abbey Road Studios**, cemented its reputation[1][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Official specs list **frequency range (−6 dB) 17.5 Hz–25 kHz with the optional alignment filter / 24 Hz–25 kHz without**, **free-field frequency response ±2 dB: 20 Hz–20 kHz (with filter) / 39 Hz–20 kHz (without)**, **sensitivity 87 dB (2.83 V/1 m)**, **nominal impedance 4 Ω**, and **distortion at 95 dB/1 m: 2nd <1.5% (20–100 Hz) / <0.5% (100 Hz–20 kHz); 3rd <0.5% (20 Hz–20 kHz)**[1]. While Series-3-specific spin data is scarce, Series 2 measurements show **presence-region lift** and **top-octave shortfall**[2]. Strong performance for its era, but shy of today’s state-of-the-art linearity; hence **0.6**.  
Note: with the **alignment filter**, LF extends to **19 Hz (−3 dB)**[1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Matrix bracing**, a separate head unit with the tweeter perched above the midrange enclosure, and crossover refinements are technically sound for reducing cabinet colorations and diffraction. Still, the **large passive 3-way** architecture predates modern **DSP-assisted active** solutions that more easily deliver textbook linearity/directivity. Solid 1990s engineering, not revolutionary in 2025: **0.7**.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Review price set at **1,800 USD** for a representative used pair. The **Emotiva Airmotiv T2+** (commonly available, **~999 USD/pair**) provides **documented CTA-2034 data with ≈±2.5 dB on-axis linearity, low distortion, and rated extension to 35 Hz (±3 dB)**—**equal or better LF extension versus the 801 S3’s ±2 dB to 39 Hz without the filter**, at far lower cost[4].  
**Computation:** **999 USD ÷ 1,800 USD = 0.555… → 0.6** (one-decimal rounding).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a discontinued 1990s model, **aging crossover parts** (e.g., electrolytics) often warrant service. B&W provides **legacy documentation** but no active warranty. The enclosure/drivers are robust, yet **original parts availability** is limited. Average overall: **0.5**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 801 S3 follows **scientifically grounded** practices (stiff cabinet, diffraction control, low-distortion goal). Still, the **large passive** concept is less compelling against today’s **compact active DSP** designs that achieve higher measured transparency with less trial-and-error. Hence **0.5**.

## Advice

Pick the 801 S3 if you value **vintage studio heritage, high output, and the classic B&W voicing**. Without the alignment filter, remember its **±2 dB window only reaches to 39 Hz**; careful placement and room EQ help[1]. Budget for **crossover refurbishment** and **ample amplification**. If your priority is **measured transparency per dollar**, **modern towers like Emotiva Airmotiv T2+** with published spin data are compelling[4].
