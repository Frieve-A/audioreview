## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins 804 D3 is a floorstanding speaker from the third generation of the Diamond Series, developed by the established British audio manufacturer. It features a 3-way design with a 25mm diamond dome tweeter, a 130mm Continuum FST midrange driver, and two 165mm Aerofoil cone bass drivers. The manufacturer specifies a frequency response of 24Hz-28kHz (±3dB). Positioned as a staple product in the premium audio market, it builds on the company's history and brand strength. The speaker is designed to provide both visual and acoustic presence through high-quality cabinet finishing and proprietary driver technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Objective evaluation based on third-party measurement data reveals multiple issues that can affect audibility. The frequency response, according to measurements by SoundStage!, is 28Hz-20kHz (±3.0dB), which is on the edge of the problematic level as per our measurement criteria. Total harmonic distortion (THD) is particularly problematic, exceeding 1% in the low frequencies below 100Hz and reaching up to 3% in some cases, which significantly surpasses the problematic level (1% or more for speakers). While the nominal sensitivity is 90dB/2.83V/m, measurements from Stereophile indicate it is closer to 88dB. The impedance drops to a minimum of 3.0 ohms, presenting a difficult load for amplifiers. While the bass extension is excellent, the overall measured performance does not reach a transparent level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The diamond dome tweeter represents the company's flagship technology with theoretical justification, offering high rigidity and low mass to suppress high-frequency distortion. The Continuum FST midrange driver uses a woven composite structure designed to suppress break-up modes, showing technical rationality. The Aerofoil bass drivers feature an aerodynamically optimized design to reduce unwanted vibrations. The crossover frequencies of 350Hz/4kHz are appropriate choices considering each driver's characteristics. However, these technologies represent the company's long-term accumulation rather than groundbreaking innovations that revolutionize the industry. While the design completion is high, there remains room for improvement under current measurement technology standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The 804 D3 is discontinued, making new units unavailable. Its original launch price was approximately 9,000 USD per pair. The successor model, the 804 D4, currently sells for around 14,000 USD per pair. For comparison, current 3-way floorstanding speakers such as the ELAC Uni-Fi Reference UFR52 (approx. 1,400 USD per pair) and the Revel Concerta2 F36 (approx. 2,200 USD per pair) offer superior or comparable measured performance at a fraction of the price. Based on the price difference with current products offering equivalent function and superior measured performance, the cost-performance is evaluated poorly. The calculation is `1,400 USD ÷ 9,000 USD ≒ 0.16`, resulting in a score of 0.2.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Bowers & Wilkins, established in 1966, maintains a well-established repair system and global support network as a veteran manufacturer. In most regions, a multi-year product warranty is provided through authorized importers, with after-sales service available at authorized dealers nationwide. The company's Diamond Series follows a long-term production policy with a stable parts supply system. The product's robust construction and quality control maintain failure rates at or below the industry average. However, due to the complex driver configuration, parts costs for repairs can be expensive. As a passive speaker requiring no firmware updates, the risk of obsolescence during long-term use is low.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The material selection and placement of each driver have a scientific basis: the diamond tweeter for reducing high-frequency distortion, the Continuum midrange for suppressing break-up modes, and the Aerofoil bass drivers for optimizing airflow—all contributing to measurable sound quality improvements. The crossover design also makes rational choices that leverage each driver's characteristics. However, despite these technological investments, the final measurement results do not reach transparent levels, indicating room for improvement in the effective application of technology. Furthermore, given that comparable or better performance is achievable at a significantly lower cost with other products, questions arise about the necessity of its existence as a dedicated audio device at its price point. While the steadfast adherence to traditional approaches is notable, efforts toward innovation and cost reduction appear limited.

## Advice

Those considering a purchase should be aware that this product is discontinued and are recommended to make objective comparisons with current 3-way floorstanding speakers. Current products such as the ELAC Uni-Fi Reference UFR52 and Revel Concerta2 F36 offer superior measured performance at significantly lower prices. When auditioning, carefully evaluate how the high THD characteristics, especially in the bass, and the ±3.0dB frequency response deviation actually affect music reproduction. These measurement limitations may become apparent, particularly in applications emphasizing high-volume playback or precise sound imaging. When considering used market purchases, carefully verify the condition and deterioration of the drivers, and also consider the availability of repair parts. When selecting an amplifier, thoroughly confirm its capability to drive a low impedance load of 3.0 ohms and choose a model with adequate current supply.
