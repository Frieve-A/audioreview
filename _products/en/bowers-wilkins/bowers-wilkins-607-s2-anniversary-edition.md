## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins 607 S2 Anniversary Edition represents the entry-level standmount in B&W's 600 Series lineup. This conventional two-way passive bookshelf speaker features a 5-inch Continuum cone bass/midrange driver borrowed from the flagship 800 Series Diamond, paired with a 25mm aluminum dome tweeter. Key technological features include the Flowport rear-firing bass reflex design and upgraded Mundorf bypass capacitors identical to those used in the 700 Series Signature. At 1,480 USD per pair, the speaker targets audiophiles seeking B&W's signature sound in a compact format.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 607 S2 Anniversary Edition achieves performance between problematic and transparent levels based on comprehensive third-party measurements. Third-harmonic distortion measures 0.7% across the frequency range, falling between the transparent level (0.1%) and problematic threshold (1%+) for speakers [1]. Second-harmonic distortion remains below 1% over most of the audible range, rising to 1.3% only below 100Hz. Intermodulation distortion products measure just 0.07% at 6.4, 9.1, and 10.4kHz, substantially better than the 1% problematic level. Frequency response spans 52Hz to 28kHz (±3dB), meeting standard requirements though not achieving the ±0.5dB transparent level. The measured performance demonstrates scientifically audible improvements over lower-tier alternatives.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

B&W incorporates proven proprietary technologies including the Continuum cone driver technology derived from their 800 Series Diamond flagship line and the dimpled Flowport bass reflex design. The Fixed Suspension Transducer (FST) technology isolates the driver from cabinet vibrations while improving responsiveness. However, the technologies represent mature implementations rather than cutting-edge innovation. The Continuum cone was introduced in 2018, making it contemporary but not revolutionary. The purely analog/mechanical approach lacks digital integration or advanced signal processing found in modern designs. While the technical execution demonstrates high know-how accumulation, the conservative approach limits breakthrough potential.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

At 1,480 USD per pair, the 607 S2 Anniversary Edition faces direct competition from the KEF LS50 Meta at 1,599 USD per pair, which provides equivalent-or-better performance with superior imaging precision and innovative Metamaterial technology. Equipped with equivalent two-way bookshelf design, and frequency response range and distortion characteristics are equivalent-or-better. CP = 1,480 USD ÷ 1,599 USD = 0.9. Budget alternatives like the Polk Audio T15 (70 USD per pair) show significant performance deficiencies including substantial 3-5kHz frequency response dips and poor treble extension above 2.5kHz that disqualify them as equivalent performers.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Bowers & Wilkins provides exceptional support with a 5-year warranty for passive loudspeakers, significantly exceeding the industry standard 2-year coverage [2]. The passive design inherently reduces failure points compared to active speakers, contributing to long-term reliability. B&W operates a global support infrastructure with dedicated service networks and comprehensive technical support. The company's 50+ year track record demonstrates consistent reliability across product lines. Customer support includes 30-day home trial periods for direct purchases and established repair authorization processes. The robust construction using quality materials further enhances durability expectations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

B&W's design philosophy emphasizes traditional acoustic engineering approaches with premium materials and craftsmanship. While the company demonstrates measurement competence and scientific understanding, the approach remains conservative, focusing on established technologies rather than pursuing cutting-edge innovations. The premium pricing incorporates significant brand value components that may not be fully justified by measurable performance improvements over less expensive alternatives. The philosophy prioritizes subjective elements like material prestige (aluminum tweeters, composite cones) alongside objective performance metrics. Limited adoption of modern technologies like DSP, room correction, or advanced measurement-based optimization reduces the rationality score for contemporary audio development.

## Advice

The 607 S2 Anniversary Edition suits audiophiles prioritizing traditional acoustic design with proven technologies over cutting-edge innovation. The speaker delivers scientifically validated transparent-level performance with excellent distortion characteristics, making it suitable for critical listening applications. Buyers seeking maximum cost-effectiveness should consider this the entry point for transparent-level passive bookshelf speakers, as cheaper alternatives sacrifice measurable performance. However, those prioritizing innovation or value-oriented approaches may find better alignment with brands emphasizing measurement-first design philosophies. The 5-year warranty and global support network provide additional value for long-term ownership.
