## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins Emphasis stands as one of the most distinctive speakers in audio history, representing a rare departure from B&W's traditionally measurement-focused approach toward pure artistic expression. Originally conceived in 1989 by Moreton V. Warren and manufactured from 1991-1992, the Emphasis had extremely limited production, making it among the rarest production speakers from a major manufacturer. Originally priced at £6,500, the Emphasis features a unique sculptural form resembling a "bass saxophone" or "giant lily," constructed using fiberglass and RTM (Resin Transfer Moulding) with a heavy cast iron base. This 2-way passive floorstanding speaker features a 165mm Kevlar cone woofer and 25mm metal dome tweeter, prioritizing aesthetic innovation over conventional audio engineering and positioning it more as a collector's art piece than a performance-oriented loudspeaker.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. Available specifications include only basic frequency response (49Hz-20kHz ±3dB) and sensitivity (87dB), which meet standard levels but lack critical audio quality measurements. No data exists for THD, SNR, dynamic range, IMD, or crosstalk measurements from credible third-party sources. The frequency response specification suggests performance between problematic and transparent levels, while sensitivity falls within standard ranges for passive speakers. Contemporary subjective descriptions mention "limited dynamic capabilities" and suitability for "modest sound levels," indicating potential performance limitations. Without comprehensive measured data, the speaker cannot be evaluated against scientific audio quality criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Emphasis demonstrated technical innovation for its era through the unique quarter-wave tapered column design and advanced RTM construction methodology. The sculptural form factor represented original engineering thinking, positioning drivers away from ground reflective surfaces for reduced interference. B&W's accumulated speaker design expertise contributed to the technical execution, including proprietary design elements and in-house development. However, the technology is now over three decades outdated, lacking modern digital integration, advanced materials, or contemporary acoustic modeling found in current high-end speakers. The quarter-wave loading system, while innovative for its time, represents analog-only mechanical engineering without the computational acoustics and DSP capabilities that define modern speaker technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Current market pricing for the Emphasis is effectively non-existent due to extreme rarity, with no active listings found across major used equipment platforms. Using historical pricing of 6,500 USD (converted from £6,500 original price) as reference, equivalent-or-better performance can be achieved through contemporary alternatives. The JBL Stage A170 (499.99 USD) provides superior frequency response (44Hz-40kHz vs 49Hz-20kHz) and higher sensitivity (89dB vs 87dB). Equipped with extended frequency range and improved sensitivity, the Stage A170 represents equivalent-or-better performance across all measurable parameters. CP = 499.99 USD ÷ 6,500 USD = 0.077, rounded to 0.1. However, given the Emphasis's collector status and artistic value beyond pure audio function, actual market pricing when available would likely exceed original retail significantly.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Emphasis benefits from robust construction using fiberglass body and cast iron base with relatively simple 2-way passive design, contributing to inherent reliability. B&W maintains a strong historical reputation for build quality and longevity across their product range. However, being discontinued for over 30 years, no manufacturer warranty or support exists for this model. Current B&W warranty coverage (5 years for passive speakers) applies only to contemporary products. Repair support requires third-party services, with potentially high costs due to age, rarity, and specialized construction materials. Parts availability is extremely limited given the extremely small production run. The RTM construction and cast iron base, while durable, present challenges for field repair compared to conventional cabinet construction.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

While B&W historically maintains a science-based design philosophy rooted in John Bowers' measurement-focused approach, the Emphasis represents a significant departure toward artistic expression rather than performance optimization. Described explicitly as "more a work of art than a traditional speaker," the majority of development costs supported sculptural aesthetics rather than measurable audio improvements. The product demonstrated "limited dynamic capabilities" and was not positioned as part of B&W's performance-focused product progression. Development resources were invested primarily in complex RTM manufacturing and aesthetic form factor rather than advancing acoustic engineering or measurement performance. This approach contradicts rational audio design principles that prioritize measurable improvements in frequency response, distortion, or dynamic range relative to cost investment.

## Advice

The Bowers & Wilkins Emphasis should be considered exclusively by collectors seeking a historically significant art piece rather than purchasers prioritizing audio performance. With extremely limited production and essentially no market availability, acquisition would require specialized dealer networks or auction houses, likely at significant premiums over original pricing. For users seeking actual audio performance, contemporary alternatives like the JBL Stage A170 provide superior measured specifications at substantially lower cost with full manufacturer support. The Emphasis represents an important milestone in speaker design history as a rare example of pure artistic expression from a major manufacturer, but its "limited dynamic capabilities" and lack of comprehensive measurements make it unsuitable for serious listening applications. Potential owners should expect no warranty coverage, limited service options, and performance that falls short of modern expectations for high-end audio reproduction.
