## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins CM8 is a compact 3-way ported floorstander that sat below CM9 in the former CM line. Original MSRP was **1,099 USD each**. It employs a 25 mm aluminum-dome tweeter in a Nautilus™ tapered tube, a 125 mm Kevlar® FST™ midrange, and dual 125 mm paper/Kevlar woofers. Manufacturer specifications list **frequency response (±3 dB) 69 Hz–22 kHz**, **sensitivity 88 dB (2.83 V/1 m)**, **nominal 8 Ω**, and crossovers at **350 Hz / 4 kHz**. The model is discontinued and now resides in the brand’s product archive. [1][2][4]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent anechoic measurements for the original CM8 are scarce. Verifiable facts are limited to the manufacturer’s key specs (**69 Hz–22 kHz (±3 dB), 88 dB, 8 Ω, 350 Hz/4 kHz crossovers**) and reputable summaries. With no comprehensive third-party lab data to confirm on-/off-axis response or distortion, the evidence base remains provisional, so we assign **0.5**. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

For its era/price, B&W’s FST™ midrange (fixed-surround Kevlar for pistonic behavior), Nautilus™ tube-loaded tweeter back-chamber, Flowport, and an orderly crossover topology are competent engineering choices that target low distortion and good transients. They remain solid rather than cutting-edge today. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Denominator (review target price, pair): 900 USD** (representative used-market pair price). [5][6]  
**Cheapest equal-or-better current alternative (non-inferior functions/performance):** **JBL Stage A180**, official price **399.95 USD each → 799.90 USD per pair**; published specs indicate deeper bandwidth and slightly higher sensitivity than CM8. **CP = 799.90 ÷ 900 ≈ 0.89 → 0.9** (rounded to one decimal). [3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The CM8 is discontinued and listed in the manufacturer’s product archive; warranty/parts depend on region and used availability. [4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A slim 3-way with a dedicated midrange and sensible filter orders aims at good dynamics and imaging in modest rooms. Trade-offs include limited bass headroom (**–3 dB at 69 Hz**) and system/placement sensitivity, which is consistent with the design’s constraints. [1]

## Advice

- If you value **articulate mids in a slim tower** and listen at moderate levels, a clean used pair can satisfy—consider **subwoofer support below ~60–70 Hz**.  
- If you want **new, deeper bass by spec at lower price**, audition **JBL Stage A180 (799.90 USD/pair official)** as a cost-effective alternative. [3]  
- When buying used, check cabinet condition, driver symmetry, and return policy carefully. [4][6]
