## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins Matrix 802 Series 3 represents a significant milestone in loudspeaker design from the 1990s era. Manufactured between 1992 and 1998, this 3-way bass reflex floorstanding speaker showcased B&W's pioneering Matrix cabinet bracing technology and patented Kevlar cone drivers. Standing 1,040mm tall and weighing 32kg, the Matrix 802 S3 featured dual 180mm woofers, a 126mm Kevlar midrange driver, and a 26mm metal dome tweeter. As the flagship model in the Matrix series below the professional 801, it embodied B&W's "absolute free rein" development philosophy, where engineers pursued the highest standards without conventional commercial restrictions. The speaker's distinctive yellow Kevlar cones and Matrix internal bracing structure became iconic elements that influenced loudspeaker design industry-wide.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Based on manufacturer specifications, the Matrix 802 S3 achieves a frequency response of 42Hz-20kHz ±3dB with 90dB sensitivity at 2.83V/1m, while alternative specifications from HiFi Wiki indicate 27-20,000 Hz (±2 dB) [1]. The discrepancy between these specifications suggests measurement uncertainty. Without comprehensive third-party measurements for THD, SNR, crosstalk, directivity characteristics, or other critical distortion parameters, evaluation relies primarily on manufacturer frequency response specifications. Conservative evaluation is applied due to limited independently verified measurement data. The score may be updated to a higher value if detailed THD and directivity data become available. The specified frequency response performance represents standard level and is not at problematic levels, though it does not reach the transparent level expected for high-fidelity reproduction in contemporary systems.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Matrix 802 S3 demonstrates significant technological innovation for its era. B&W's patented Matrix bracing technology, introduced in 1987, employed an internal lattice of interlocking spars that dramatically improved cabinet rigidity and reduced vibration [2]. This system became the "blueprint for construction of all Bowers & Wilkins speakers" and influenced industry-wide adoption of advanced cabinet bracing. The patented Kevlar cone technology, originally developed for bulletproof vests, was adapted by B&W starting in 1974 to reduce unwanted standing waves in loudspeaker drivers [2]. The Matrix 802 S3 represented complete in-house design with high technical expertise accumulated through B&W's dedicated Steyning Research Establishment, founded in 1982. However, from a 2025 perspective, the 1990s analog-only technology approach lacks the advanced digital integration, DSP capabilities, and software-based optimization found in contemporary designs. The Matrix bracing and Kevlar technologies had lasting competitive advantages that took competitors years to develop alternatives, demonstrating the high technology level achieved for its time period.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The Matrix 802 S3's current used market price of 1,750 USD positions it poorly against modern alternatives offering equivalent or better specifications. Frequency response (42Hz-20kHz ±3dB) and sensitivity (90dB) are equivalent-or-better compared to current alternatives. The Klipsch Reference R-610F provides 45Hz-21kHz frequency response (±3dB), 94dB sensitivity at 2.83V/1M, and 8-ohm impedance, available for approximately 400 USD per pair as current market pricing [3]. Frequency response (45Hz-21kHz ±3dB) and sensitivity (94dB) are equivalent-or-better. CP = 400 USD ÷ 1,750 USD = 0.23. This comparison acknowledges limitations in available comprehensive third-party measurement data for direct performance verification between products. The score may be updated to a higher value if detailed THD and directivity data become available. However, based on manufacturer specifications, significantly cheaper alternatives with equivalent-or-better frequency response and superior sensitivity are readily available, making the Matrix 802 S3's cost-performance poor despite its historical significance and build quality reputation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Matrix 802 S3 faces significant reliability and support challenges as a discontinued vintage product manufactured from 1992-1998. While B&W originally provided a 5-year warranty period for passive loudspeakers that was above average for its era, current factory support is severely limited for products discontinued over 25 years ago. As typical with vintage speakers, age-related component degradation including rubber surrounds, crossover capacitors, and driver deterioration can occur after 20+ years, requiring third-party repair services since no official replacement parts are available from the manufacturer. The speakers' complex construction with proprietary Matrix bracing and specialized components makes generic replacement parts challenging without potentially affecting frequency response characteristics. B&W's current warranty policy covers only products purchased from authorized retailers and is non-transferable, excluding used/vintage products. While the Matrix bracing provides inherently robust cabinet construction that reduces structural failures, the discontinued status, lack of manufacturer parts support, and age-related component reliability concerns significantly impact long-term reliability assessment for potential buyers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Matrix 802 S3 demonstrates mixed rationality in design philosophy when evaluated against contemporary standards. B&W's development approach granted engineers "absolute free rein to develop the very best loudspeaker they could, without any of the usual restrictions," driving meaningful technological innovations including the Matrix bracing system and Kevlar cone technology that directly addressed measurable acoustic problems [2]. The company's establishment of the Steyning Research Establishment in 1982 demonstrated commitment to rigorous scientific research and measurement-focused development [2]. The Matrix and Kevlar technologies represented significant innovations with lasting competitive advantages that influenced industry-wide adoption. However, the 1990s analog-only technology approach lacks the advanced digital integration, DSP capabilities, software-based optimization, and active signal processing found in rational contemporary designs. From today's perspective, the exclusive reliance on passive analog technology without embracing cutting-edge digital optimization represents a conservative approach that limits potential for measurement-driven improvements. While innovative for its era, the design philosophy's resistance to incorporating modern digital audio processing technologies reduces its rationality when evaluated against current scientific understanding of optimal loudspeaker design approaches.

## Advice

The Matrix 802 S3 should be considered primarily by audio enthusiasts interested in vintage high-end equipment with historical significance rather than those seeking optimal measured performance. At 1,750 USD used market prices, modern alternatives like the Klipsch Reference R-610F offer equivalent-or-better specifications at dramatically lower cost. Potential buyers must factor in potential age-related maintenance costs and accept that no manufacturer support exists for aging components. The speakers may appeal to collectors appreciating B&W's pioneering Matrix technology and Kevlar innovations that influenced industry development. However, frequency response limitations compared to modern standards make them less suitable for accurate monitoring or reference applications. Consider these speakers only if vintage aesthetics, historical importance, and B&W brand legacy outweigh measured performance limitations and ongoing maintenance requirements.
