## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins 801D4 is the flagship speaker in the company's 800 Series Diamond lineup. As the latest generation of the 801 series with 42 years of history, it incorporates advanced technologies including diamond dome tweeter, Matrix bracing, and sophisticated crossover design. It has an established track record as a reference monitor in many recording studios. The specifications include a frequency range of 13Hz-35kHz (-6dB), sensitivity of 90dB/2.83V/m, and nominal impedance of 8Ω (minimum 3.0Ω) in a 3-way design. The price in the US market is approximately 46,000 USD per pair.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The measured performance is excellent for a high-end speaker. Total harmonic distortion achieves less than 1% from 30Hz-20kHz and less than 0.3% from 100Hz-20kHz. While this doesn't reach the excellent level for speakers (0.1% or below), it significantly exceeds the problematic level (1% or above). The frequency response shows 13Hz-35kHz (-6dB) and 15Hz-28kHz (±3dB), demonstrating good characteristics within the ±3dB range. The 90dB/2.83V/m sensitivity provides high efficiency, and the minimum impedance of 3.0Ω is within a drivable range. Detailed measurements from Stereophile magazine confirm excellent performance within audible thresholds, making this a product that provides acoustically significant improvements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

It incorporates numerous proprietary technologies at the industry's highest level. The diamond dome tweeter achieves extremely high rigidity and light weight, pursuing ideal frequency characteristics. Matrix bracing technology suppresses cabinet resonance, and precise crossover design at 400Hz and 4kHz represent innovative and advanced engineering. These technologies directly contribute to measurable performance improvements, demonstrating proprietary development rather than simple OEM design. The fusion of design philosophy continuously refined over 42 years with cutting-edge technology maintains industry-leading technical standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The cost-performance is extremely poor. While the 801D4 costs 46,000 USD per pair, equivalent or superior functionality and measured performance are offered by Tekton Design Ulfberht (approximately 9,000 USD per pair) and Genelec 8361A (approximately 10,900 USD per pair). These achieve 20Hz-20kHz or better frequency response, 95dB or higher sensitivity, and less than 0.3% distortion while providing equivalent user-oriented functionality to the 801D4. Cost-performance calculation: average alternative price (9,950 USD) ÷ 46,000 USD ≈ 0.216, rounded to 0.2. This price difference represents approximately a 5x premium that is difficult to justify based on objective performance-to-price ratio.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Industry-leading reliability and support infrastructure. Bowers & Wilkins is an established manufacturer with over 75 years of history, maintaining a global authorized dealer network and after-sales service system. High durability has been proven through long-term use in many professional studios. The warranty period exceeds industry standards, and parts supply and repair support continue for extended periods. However, this represents the expected standard for products in this price category, without particularly outstanding elements.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy rationally emphasizes improving measured performance. The adoption of diamond material is based on theoretical pursuit of rigidity and weight reduction, while Matrix bracing for resonance suppression represents an acoustically rational approach. The company makes no unscientific claims or advertising of unmeasurable effects, focusing development efforts on objective performance improvements. However, given that equivalent measured performance can be achieved at significantly lower cost through alternative technical approaches, the necessity for expensive specialized audio equipment is limited. There are aspects of cost-inefficient material investment, making it not entirely rational.

## Advice

Prospective buyers need careful consideration. While the 801D4 certainly possesses excellent measured performance and high technical standards, equivalent acoustic performance can be achieved with products like the Tekton Design Ulfberht and Genelec 8361A at approximately one-fifth the cost. The approximately 36,050 USD price difference should be considered payment for brand value, aesthetic design, and ownership satisfaction. For those seeking purely audio quality improvement, alternative products offer superior investment efficiency. However, for professional applications or those prioritizing brand status, the reliability and technical refinement are at the highest level. Direct comparison listening with the above alternatives is strongly recommended before purchase. It is important to objectively evaluate cost-performance by weighing the objective performance difference against the price difference.
