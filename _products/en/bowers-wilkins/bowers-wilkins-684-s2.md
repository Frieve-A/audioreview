## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins 684 S2 was a slim two-way floorstanding model in the 600 S2 line, launched in 2014 and now discontinued/archived by the manufacturer [3][1]. It used dual 130 mm woven-Kevlar bass/mid drivers and a 25 mm Decoupled Double Dome aluminum tweeter in a bass-reflex cabinet with Flowport [1]. The launch price was 1,150 USD per pair [2], and the model has been superseded by newer 600-series generations [4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer data: on-axis frequency response 72 Hz–22 kHz (±3 dB), –6 dB points 45 Hz and 50 kHz; sensitivity 87 dB (2.83 V/1 m); nominal 8 Ω (min. 4 Ω); THD (2nd+3rd) at 90 dB/1 m <1 % from 140 Hz–22 kHz and <0.5 % from 180 Hz–20 kHz [1].  
Independent data: NRC anechoic measurements published by SoundStage! include full on/off-axis curves, listening-window response, THD+N at 90 dB, sensitivity measured at 86.25 dB (2.83 V/1 m), and impedance/phase [5]. Overall, these place the 684 S2 around “average/passable” for passive towers rather than near-transparent.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Conventional but competent design: two parallel 130 mm bass/mid drivers cross to a 25 mm dome tweeter at 4 kHz [1]. B&W’s Decoupled Double Dome tweeter and Anti-Resonance plugs are thoughtful refinements for the time, yet the overall topology (2-way, reflex) is standard and lacks novel engineering relative to current designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The cheapest current tower with **equal-or-better measured performance** we can verify is **JBL Stage A180**, which has third-party Klippel NFS spin data from Audio Science Review, aggregated at Spinorama.org: –6 dB ≈ 41 Hz, frequency-range deviation ≈ 2.7 dB (300 Hz–5 kHz), Preference Score ≈ 4.4 (≈ 6.1 with a perfect sub) [6][7]. Current list price is **399.95 USD each** on JBL’s US site (pair: **799.90 USD**) [8].

**Equivalence note:** floorstanding stereo use; measured low-frequency extension reaches deeper, and midband linearity metrics are well-behaved; no clear measured disadvantage relative to the 684 S2’s NRC data set [5][6][7].

**Calculation:** 799.90 USD ÷ 1,150 USD = **0.695** → **0.7** (rounded to first decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The 684 S2 is in B&W’s product archive and no longer in production, so there is no manufacturer warranty for new purchases, and parts/support are limited to legacy channels [3]. While historical B&W build quality was solid, current buyers must rely on the used market, reducing support certainty compared with active models.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The 684 S2 follows rational, measurement-grounded principles (straightforward 2-way, reflex, materials with known behavior). However, given its launch-price positioning and today’s availability of current towers with comparable or better independent measurements at markedly lower prices, the historical value proposition looks weak.

## Advice

Avoid for new purchase unless found at a significant discount on the used market. If you need a basic floorstander with verified independent measurements, **JBL Stage A180** is a solid baseline to compare against [6][7][8]. If you prefer a current audiophile-brand option with ongoing support, consider Wharfedale’s Diamond 12.3 and compare using independent measurements where available [9].
