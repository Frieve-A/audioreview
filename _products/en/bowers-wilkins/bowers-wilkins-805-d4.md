## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins 805 D4 is a two-way, reflex-loaded premium bookshelf speaker featuring a 1-inch diamond-dome tweeter and a 6.5-inch Continuum cone woofer. Key specs are **42Hz–28kHz (±3dB)** frequency response, **88dB** sensitivity, and **8Ω** nominal impedance (min **4.6Ω**). It employs a reverse-wrap curved cabinet, Matrix internal bracing, and a machined-aluminum Solid Body Tweeter-on-Top enclosure.[3]  
**Price:** **10,000 USD per pair** (US direct).[3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

- **Stated specs:** 42Hz–28kHz (±3dB), 88dB sensitivity, 8Ω nominal / 4.6Ω min.[3]  
- **Independent data (standard 805 D4):** SoundStage Network’s NRC tests report **84.4dB** listening-window sensitivity (2.83V/1m), indicating more demanding real-world drive than the spec suggests.[2]  
- **Treble balance & load (related model evidence):** Stereophile’s **805 D4 Signature** measurements show the tweeter **up to ~5dB high** and **EPDR minima of 2Ω at 8.9–10kHz**, implying a current-hungry load (cited as a closely related variant’s behavior).[1]

Net: construction tech is advanced, but **elevated treble** and **challenging load / modest effective sensitivity** hinder neutral, amplifier-friendly reproduction.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Highlights include a diamond tweeter, elongated Solid Body Tweeter-on-Top (aluminum, tube-loaded), Continuum cone, reverse-wrap laminated cabinet, and Matrix bracing—credible advances in materials, acoustics, and structural engineering that justify a high technology rating.[3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At **10,000 USD/pair**, the 805 D4 faces severe value pressure. **KEF R3 Meta** at **2,499.99 USD/pair** delivers equivalent user-facing functionality (bookshelf monitoring) with a **three-way** layout (25mm HF / 125mm MF / 165mm LF), **58Hz–28kHz (±3dB)** response, **87dB** sensitivity, and low published distortion (90dB, 1m: **≤0.5% from 90Hz–20kHz**). Independent testing confirms excellent linearity and controlled directivity.[4][5][6]

**CP math (USD):** 2,499.99 USD ÷ 10,000 USD = **0.25** → 0.3 (rounded). Professional pedigree cannot justify a ~4× price premium over an equal-or-better measured alternative for most use cases.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Bowers & Wilkins provides robust warranty and global service coverage. Build quality (cabinet, drivers, terminals) is commensurate with a premium price tier. No widespread major reliability issues are evident; parts availability and technical assistance align with the brand’s positioning.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design targets real engineering goals—resonance control, enclosure stiffness, and driver behavior—with coherent solutions.[3] Yet measured **treble elevation** and **demanding electrical load** create trade-offs for fidelity and system-matching.[1][2] Given cheaper peers with similar or better objective performance, value optimization appears secondary to brand positioning and aesthetics.

## Advice

Choose the 805 D4 if you prioritize **brand design/finish and ownership appeal**, and can manage **amp pairing and room setup**. For most buyers, **KEF R3 Meta (2,499.99 USD/pair)** merits first audition as a dramatically more economical path to neutral, high-performance sound.[4][6] If opting for the 805 D4, verify synergy (treble balance, amplifier current delivery) via extended audition.
