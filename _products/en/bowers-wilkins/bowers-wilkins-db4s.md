summary: "The DB4S is an entry-level model in the 700 series that incorporates the same Aerofoil cone technology as higher-end models. With 1000W output and a sealed enclosure design, it provides performance suitable for music reproduction, but faces challenges in cost-performance due to the existence of competitive products that achieve equivalent performance at lower prices."

## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins DB4S is a 10-inch subwoofer belonging to the company's 700 series. Despite being the most affordable entry-level model in the DB series, it notably features the same Aerofoil cone technology used in the higher-end 800 series Diamond speakers. It incorporates a 1000W Class D amplifier and aims for accurate bass reproduction suitable for music playback through its sealed cabinet design. The unit adopts a modern approach with complete smartphone app control, eliminating physical controls entirely.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The DB4S exhibits a frequency response of 10-350Hz (±3dB), with in-room measurements showing response within 5dB from 20Hz-200Hz. The sealed design provides good transient characteristics, ensuring the low-frequency accuracy important for music reproduction. However, published THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) data is insufficient, making a complete evaluation of its scientific validity difficult. Detailed measurement data for dynamic range and S/N ratio is also limited, constraining a comprehensive evaluation against measurement result reference standards. Due to the inherent characteristics of sealed designs, there are physical limitations in low-frequency extension compared to ported designs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Aerofoil cone technology inherited from the 800 series represents an excellent design showcasing B&W's technical expertise. The combination of a 1000W Class D amplifier with a 50-liter sealed cabinet is rational, and the digital preamplifier with Dynamic EQ function provides modern signal processing. The complete smartphone app control system balances convenience with precise adjustment capabilities. However, it lacks the latest DSP technology and automatic calibration functions using measurement microphones that competing manufacturers employ, placing its technology level above the industry average but not at the cutting edge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the DB4S is priced at 2,199.98 USD, the SVS SB-2000 Pro, an equivalent sealed subwoofer with a 12-inch driver, is available for 799-899 USD. The SB-2000 Pro offers 550W RMS (1,500W+ peak) output, a 19-240Hz (±3dB) frequency response, and a 50MHz high-resolution DSP, providing functionality equal to or exceeding the DB4S. The cost-performance calculation (799 USD ÷ 2,199.98 USD) results in approximately 0.36, indicating that a product with equivalent or superior functionality and measured performance is available for about 36% of the price. Notably, the DB4S achieves low-frequency extension to 10Hz while the SB-2000 Pro reaches 19Hz, giving the DB4S an advantage in this aspect. While B&W's brand quality is commendable, the pure performance-to-price ratio shows competitive challenges.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Bowers & Wilkins, established in 1966 as a British audio manufacturer, has built high reliability in the industry. Support systems through authorized dealers are established worldwide, including Japan, with warranty periods meeting industry standards. The DB4S also applies the company's quality control standards, making its manufacturing quality reliability highly rated. However, due to the smartphone app-dependent control system, future OS compatibility and continued app maintenance may present uncertain factors for long-term use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption of a sealed design emphasizing music reproduction is a rational approach toward the goal of accurate bass reproduction. The control system unified through a smartphone app, eliminating physical controls, can be evaluated as a design that considers the modern user experience. The Dynamic EQ function for automatic optimization is also a scientifically-based functionality. However, the single-driver configuration has output limitations, and physical constraints exist compared to dual-driver configurations adopted by competitive products. Additionally, the lack of automatic room calibration functionality is somewhat conservative for modern subwoofer design philosophy.

## Advice

The DB4S is a suitable choice for B&W users who prioritize consistency with the 700 series or purchasers who value brand reliability. Accurate bass reproduction through its sealed design has value in music appreciation, and smartphone app control offers high convenience. However, when prioritizing a pure performance-to-price ratio, we recommend considering competitive products with superior cost-performance, such as the SVS SB-2000 Pro or KEF KC62. Particularly when emphasizing DSP functionality and transparency of measurement data, SVS products have advantages as a scientific approach. When considering a purchase, it is important to carefully evaluate the balance between the recognition of B&W's brand value and practical performance requirements.
