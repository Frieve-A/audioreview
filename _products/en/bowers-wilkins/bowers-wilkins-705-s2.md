## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins 705 S2 represents the company's standmount loudspeaker offering in the 700 Series, incorporating technologies derived from their flagship 800 Series. These two-way reflex-loaded speakers feature a 6.5-inch Continuum cone bass/midrange driver and a 1-inch decoupled carbon dome tweeter housed in a precision-machined aluminum pod. Originally priced at 2,500 USD per pair, the 705 S2 targets the premium bookshelf speaker market with proprietary driver technologies and sophisticated acoustic engineering. Note that availability may be limited as some retailers list this model as discontinued, though official confirmation is not available. Bowers & Wilkins, established in 1966, has built a reputation for high-end loudspeaker design with a focus on accurate sound reproduction and advanced materials science.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Frequency response specifications of 50Hz-28kHz (±3dB) represent standard performance for this speaker category. Third-party measurements from the National Research Council of Canada provide credible validation with THD+N at 1kHz measuring below 0.1%, achieving transparent level performance [2]. Measured sensitivity of 85.4dB shows a difference from the specified 88dB, but remains within practical limits [2]. The ±3dB frequency response deviation meets standard levels, and the actual measured THD performance reaching transparent levels results in a transparent-level boundary assessment for scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The 705 S2 incorporates multiple proprietary technologies developed in-house at Bowers & Wilkins. The Continuum cone technology, originally developed for the 800 Series, represents genuine advancement over conventional driver materials [1]. The decoupled carbon dome tweeter with precision-machined aluminum housing demonstrates sophisticated engineering that would require significant time for competitors to replicate [3]. Additional technologies include the Solid Body Tweeter-on-Top design for acoustic optimization and Flowport technology for port design [1]. The company's commitment to developing bespoke technologies rather than using off-the-shelf solutions, combined with high accumulation of know-how in driver technology and acoustic design, results in technology that other companies would want to adopt.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

CP = 1,600 USD ÷ 2,500 USD = 0.6. The KEF LS50 Meta, with standard retail pricing at 1,600 USD per pair, provides equivalent-or-better performance with comparable frequency response range and maximum output capability of 106dB [4]. Equipped with equivalent 2-way standmount design and 8-ohm nominal impedance, and frequency response width of ±3dB are equivalent-or-better. Third-party measurements indicate the KEF LS50 Meta shows increased distortion at higher SPL levels, particularly in the 1-2kHz region, while maintaining lower distortion at moderate levels compared to the 705 S2's "less than 1%" specification [4]. While the Bowers & Wilkins offers proprietary technologies and premium construction, the price premium over functionally equivalent alternatives results in moderate cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Bowers & Wilkins provides a 5-year warranty for passive loudspeakers, significantly exceeding the industry average of 2 years [5]. The passive design with minimal moving parts inherently reduces failure risk compared to active systems. The company's establishment in 1966 and global presence provide proven track record and comprehensive support infrastructure through authorized dealers and service centers worldwide [5]. Simple passive loudspeaker construction with robust driver technologies and precision-machined aluminum components suggest inherently reliable design. The extended warranty period demonstrates manufacturer confidence in build quality and provides superior support duration compared to typical industry standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Bowers & Wilkins demonstrates a rational, science-based approach with their "True Sound" philosophy focused on delivering recorded sound exactly as the artist intended without coloration [6]. The company explicitly states that "measurement and analysis remains a major part of the Bowers & Wilkins philosophy" and continues investment in state-of-the-art measurement facilities [6]. Their performance-first approach guides every decision in crafting technologies, with costs directly contributing to function and measurement performance improvement through proprietary driver development [6]. The focus on developing bespoke technologies rather than using off-the-shelf solutions represents advanced functional integration suited to user purposes. Innovation investment in proprietary technologies like Continuum cone and carbon dome tweeters directly contributes to measurable performance improvements rather than marketing-driven features.

## Advice

The 705 S2 targets users who prioritize premium engineering and proprietary technologies over pure cost-performance. Potential buyers should first confirm current availability, as some retailers list this model as discontinued. For those able to source the speakers, consider whether the advanced Continuum cone technology and precision aluminum tweeter housing justify the price premium over alternatives like the KEF LS50 Meta. The 5-year warranty and Bowers & Wilkins' established support network provide confidence for long-term ownership. These speakers suit listeners who value brand heritage and sophisticated acoustic engineering, particularly those seeking standmount speakers with proven technology derived from flagship series. However, buyers focused purely on measured performance per dollar may find equivalent functionality in competing products at lower prices.
