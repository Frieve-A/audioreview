rating: [3.9, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.8]
summary: "A measurement-first review of B&W’s flagship standmount. Independent data confirms 88.4dB(B) sensitivity, ~4.7Ω impedance minima with low EPDR, -6dB LF extension to 41Hz, and low THD at 90dB. Treble energy rises above 9–10kHz, so setup/toe-in matters. Cost-performance computes to 0.7 versus KEF Reference 1 Meta, the cheapest equal-or-better option."

## Overview

The 805 D4 Signature sits atop B&W’s standmount lineup, combining a 1" Diamond Dome tweeter and 6.5" Continuum cone in a 2-way, reflex design with the Solid-Body Tweeter-on-Top, reinforced cabinet architecture, and an upgraded crossover layout/components. Manufacturer specs list 42Hz–28kHz (±3dB) and 88dB/2.83V/1m[2]. US direct price is **14,000 USD/pair**; the dedicated FS-805 D4 stands are **1,600 USD/pair**[2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent measurements estimate sensitivity at **88.4dB(B)/2.83V/1m** and show impedance minima around **4.68Ω @175Hz** and **4Ω @20kHz**; EPDR dips below 3Ω in parts of the bass/treble, indicating a current-demanding load[1]. Hi-Fi News reports **LF extension to 41Hz (-6dB)** and **THD at 90dB/1m of 0.3% (100Hz), 0.19% (1kHz), 0.55% (10kHz)**[5]. On the other hand, response exhibits a U-shaped tendency with a rise through the upper treble (peak around 9–10kHz), so neutral balance requires careful placement and toe-in[1][5]. Excellent distortion/cabinet/dispersion control but non-flat tonal balance yields **0.7**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Diamond tweeter, Continuum cone, Solid-Body Tweeter-on-Top, Matrix bracing, and refined crossover implementation represent advanced, rational engineering[2]. Data corroborate a very quiet cabinet, controlled directivity, and clean time-domain behavior[1][5]. The intentional treble lift keeps it short of a perfect technical score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

We select **KEF Reference 1 Meta** as the **cheapest equal-or-better** comparator: a three-way standmount with exemplary linearity/directivity and similar bandwidth (EAC NFS shows **F3 ≈45Hz**)[3][4][6]. Current representative US prices: **805 D4 Signature 14,000 USD/pair**[2]; **Reference 1 Meta 10,000 USD/pair**[3].  
**Computation (USD basis)**: 10,000 ÷ 14,000 = **0.714…** → rounds to **0.7**.  
Equivalence note: Both are premium passive standmounts with comparable low-frequency reach (805 Sig 41Hz, -6dB[5]; Ref 1 Meta ≈45Hz[4]) and first-rate measured linearity/directivity (Ref 1 Meta with full CTA-2034 data)[4][6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

B&W’s long record in this segment, typical 5-year warranty after registration, and the product’s passive nature support a high confidence level in long-term ownership[2][5]. No widespread reliability issues are evident.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The product’s acoustic architecture and mechanical control measures are scientifically grounded and borne out in measurements[1][5]. The elevated upper-treble balance aims at “air,” which can be room- and preference-dependent; with proper setup the approach remains defensible and coherent.

## Advice

Choose amplification comfortable with **low EPDR** passages and 4Ω loads[1]. Optimize **tweeter-height listening axis and toe-in** to balance 3–12kHz energy[1][5]. The **FS-805 D4** stands (1,600 USD/pair) offer appropriate height and rigidity[2]. Subwoofers are optional; extension is already solid for a standmount, but very low-frequency reinforcement may help at distance/high SPL. If **value for money** is paramount, **KEF Reference 1 Meta** at 10,000 USD/pair remains the strongest equal-or-better alternative[3][4][6].
