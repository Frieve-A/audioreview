## Overview

The Bowers & Wilkins DB2D is a premium active subwoofer featuring dual 250 mm (10-inch) Aerofoil drivers in a balanced push-push configuration, a 1,000 W Class-D amplifier, app-based room optimization with BT-LE control, and multiple inputs including balanced XLR and RCA. It targets high-end music and home theater systems [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer documentation specifies **10 Hz–350 Hz (−3 dB, centered on 100 Hz)** and **8.5 Hz–500 Hz (−6 dB)**, with the dual-opposed layout minimizing cabinet vibration [1]. These are exceptional figures for a compact sealed sub. However, comprehensive third-party measurements for DB2D (e.g., standardized max SPL vs. distortion across bands) are not publicly available from established labs. Given the absence of independent verification for THD and deep-bass output, this score remains conservative pending independent testing.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The DB2D leverages high-stiffness Aerofoil cones, a balanced push-push architecture, DSP-assisted response shaping, app-driven calibration, and a high-power Class-D platform. This is a modern, coherent implementation. Some competitors offer more granular user DSP, but the core tech here is advanced and rational.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Price (US): 5,400 USD** [2].

We searched for **equal-or-better** alternatives based on user-visible functions (powered sub with EQ/app control) and key performance (deep-bass extension at or below **10 Hz (−3 dB)**).  
- **SVS SB-3000** is rated **18–270 Hz (±3 dB)**—well short of 10 Hz—and thus not equivalent by spec [3].  
- **KEF KC92** (dual-opposed 9") claims **11–200 Hz (±3 dB)** at **2,499.99 USD**, close but still **inferior in extension** by spec [4][5].  
- **JTR Captivator 2400-ULF** (ported) lists **±3 dB 12–165 Hz**, with very strong ULF output per independent testing, but its **−3 dB window does not reach 10 Hz**, and design/size are substantially different [6][7].

Based on current specifications and measurements, we could not identify any **cheaper** finished product that **matches or exceeds** the DB2D’s **10 Hz (−3 dB)** spec **while offering comparable built-in functionality**. Therefore, DB2D is treated as the **lowest-cost option meeting the target performance**, and CP is **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Bowers & Wilkins maintains a global dealer and service network. Build quality is premium. Warranty terms and long-term reliability statistics are not centrally published, and the firmware-update cadence for DB-series subs is not clearly documented. Overall support infrastructure appears solid at an industry-standard level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The focus on **measurable** low-frequency extension, cabinet force cancellation, and room optimization is scientifically sensible. The engineering choices target audible improvements (deeper extension with reduced enclosure vibration) rather than cosmetic flourish.

## Advice

If you **require** a compact sealed subwoofer with **true 10 Hz (−3 dB)** extension and app-based calibration, the DB2D is uniquely positioned. If your priority is **value** and you can accept **less extreme extension** (e.g., 11–18 Hz class), consider options like KEF KC92 or SVS models; or, if you can accommodate **much larger** enclosures and different acoustic trade-offs, ultra-low-tuned ported designs (e.g., JTR) deliver formidable ULF output but are not equivalent by the strict −3 dB extension spec.
