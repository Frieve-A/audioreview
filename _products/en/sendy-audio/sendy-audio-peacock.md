## Overview

The Sendy Audio Peacock is a flagship planar magnetic headphone from Sendy Audio, a sub-brand of Sivga Audio. It features a large 88mm driver and "Quad-Former" technology, which places coils on both sides of the diaphragm. It projects a sense of luxury with its handcrafted appearance combining wood, leather, and metal, along with an included 8-core 6N OCC copper cable. Specifications include an impedance of 50Ω, sensitivity of 103dB, a frequency response of 20Hz-40kHz, and a weight of approximately 578g.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Measurement data reveals serious issues from a sound fidelity perspective. The frequency response shows significant dips around 4kHz, 6kHz, and 10kHz, indicating inaccurate reproduction of the upper-mid and treble ranges. A more critical problem is the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), which exceeds 5% in the bass region. This value is far beyond the problematic level for headphones (0.5%) and is a direct cause of sound coloration and inaccuracy. While the 50Ω impedance and 103dB sensitivity make it easy to drive, the fundamental acoustic performance fails to reach a level that faithfully reproduces the master source.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Quad-Former technology, which places four coils (two on each side) on the diaphragm, is a design intended to drive the diaphragm more uniformly within the magnetic field and reduce distortion. The use of a large 88mm planar magnetic driver and a meticulous housing design combining wood and metal indicates a high level of manufacturing technology. Consideration is also given to accessories, such as the 8-core 6N OCC copper cable and support for a 4.4mm balanced terminal. However, these technical approaches have not translated into improvements in the final measured performance, particularly in distortion reduction. It can be said that this is a careful combination of existing technologies rather than an innovative one.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Compared to the Peacock's price of approximately 1467 USD, there are far cheaper products that comprehensively outperform it in measured performance. For example, the Hifiman Sundara, another planar magnetic headphone, achieves a flatter frequency response and more than 10 times lower distortion at a price of 352 USD. The cost-performance must be rated as 0.2, based on the calculation "352 USD ÷ 1467 USD = 0.24". Even considering the quality of the Peacock's wooden appearance and accessories, it is difficult to justify the price difference in terms of acoustic performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Sendy Audio is a relatively new manufacturer, established around 2019 as a sub-brand of Sivga Audio. Therefore, its track record for long-term product reliability and durability is still limited. In Japan, a standard one-year warranty and support are provided through authorized dealers, which is the industry standard. As a product that does not require firmware updates, its support system can be considered average. The evaluation is 0.5, taking into account the uncertainty of it being an emerging brand.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product's design philosophy is questionable. While it pursues aesthetic beauty with expensive materials like wood and leather, the core acoustic performance metrics, such as frequency response and distortion, do not meet the technical standards of modern planar magnetic headphones. The particularly high distortion suggests a potential prioritization of subjective "voicing" and external design over scientific sound quality improvement. The approximately 1467 USD price point is not supported by any demonstrable objective performance advantages, and the material investment does not directly translate to measurable acoustic improvements, indicating a lack of rationality in its design.

## Advice

The Sendy Audio Peacock is a product for users who find value in owning a beautifully crafted object with a premium material feel. However, if fidelity to the source and pure acoustic performance are top priorities, this purchase should be considered with great caution. For the same budget, numerous other products from competing brands offer overwhelmingly superior measured performance. For instance, choosing the more affordable Hifiman Sundara or stepping up to the Hifiman Arya Organic would be a far more rational choice in terms of objective sound quality. If you are considering a purchase, it is strongly recommended to audition it against other high-performance headphones to confirm whether its balance of sound and price aligns with your personal values.
