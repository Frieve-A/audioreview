## Overview

The Sendy Audio AIVA-2 is an open-back planar magnetic headphone announced in 2025 by Sendy Audio, a brand of Sivga Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., based in Dongguan, China. It features a 97×76mm driver with a 1μm dual-sided magnetic composite planar diaphragm and CNC-machined zebra wood ear cups. The price is 599 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

According to official specifications, the AIVA-2 has a frequency response of 20Hz-40kHz, 32Ω impedance, and 96dB sensitivity. Planar magnetic technology is expected to offer low distortion, but detailed third-party measurements are limited. Objective performance comparisons with peers in the same price range are also scarce, so advantages based on measurements are unclear. Scientific validity is rated at the industry average level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The combination of a 1μm diaphragm and dual-sided magnetic structure is advanced. The 97×76mm large driver, the included 6N OCC cable, and CNC-machined zebra wood ear cups indicate sound engineering. Leveraging the theoretical advantages of planar magnetic technology, the technology level is above industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comparing the AIVA-2's price of 599 USD against the HiFiMAN Sundara (299 USD) with equivalent functionality and performance: 299 USD ÷ 599 USD = 0.50, resulting in a 0.5 rating. Both models feature 32Ω impedance and an open-back planar magnetic design with equivalent basic functionality. Even if the AIVA-2 has technical advantages, the large price gap makes it an unreasonable choice.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sendy Audio is an emerging brand established in 2015, and Sivga's manufacturing base suggests a certain level of technical reliability. However, long-term market track records and warranty/repair performance remain limited. This is rated slightly above industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of planar magnetic technology and pursuit of high-speed response through 1-micron thin film represents a rational approach contributing to improved measurement performance. The ultra-nano dual-sided magnetic structure also demonstrates technically advanced design philosophy. However, the zebra wood ear cups appear more decorative than acoustically beneficial, becoming a cost-increasing factor. With competing products offering equivalent measurement performance at lower prices, questions remain about the justification for expensive dedicated headphones. While the direction toward improved measurement performance is rational, there are concerns about cost efficiency. It meets the functions expected of general audio products.

## Advice

While the AIVA-2 incorporates excellent technology, it has significant cost-performance challenges. The HiFiMAN Sundara offers equivalent or superior performance at approximately 300 USD less, making it overwhelmingly recommended as the rational choice. The AIVA-2 becomes an option only if you find special value in its 1-micron thin film technology or zebra wood ear cups and can tolerate the approximately 2x price difference. For those prioritizing pure sound quality and cost efficiency, it would be rational to consider a combination of Sundara and a high-quality amplifier within the same budget. For first-time planar magnetic users, we strongly recommend starting with the more affordable and proven Sundara. Even for those with technical interest, the price difference makes this product difficult to recommend.
