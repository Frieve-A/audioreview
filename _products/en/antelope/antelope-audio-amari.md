## Overview

The Antelope Audio Amari is a reference-grade AD/DA converter that employs an 8×DAC architecture (4×CS43198 chips per channel) to achieve an industry-leading 138dB dynamic range. Supporting 384kHz PCM/DSD256, featuring Acoustically Focused Clocking (AFC) jitter management technology, and dual headphone outputs, it was released in 2019 as a flagship product for mastering engineers and audiophiles. As a product that brings together the technical expertise of Bulgarian acoustic technology company Antelope Audio, it is designed for a wide range of applications from professional studios to high-end audio systems.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Objective evaluation based on measurement data shows extremely high performance. The 138dB dynamic range significantly exceeds the transparent level (105dB or higher) in the measurement result standard table, and the 8×DAC architecture achieves THD+N of 0.0005% or lower. Frequency response is within 20Hz-20kHz ±0.1dB, S/N ratio is 138dB, and crosstalk is -130dB or lower, achieving transparent levels in all categories. The ultra-high frequency reproduction through 384kHz support and jitter removal effects from AFC clocking technology also provide audible-level improvements with significant differences confirmed in blind tests. Even in horizontal comparison with the latest digital technologies, it boasts the highest measurement performance among currently available consumer equipment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption of 8×DAC architecture is technically advanced, with a design that theoretically improves dynamic range by operating four CS43198 chips per channel in parallel. AFC (Acoustically Focused Clocking) technology has certain technical value as a proprietary jitter management system. However, it is fundamentally a combination of Cirrus Logic chips, and the DAC chip design itself relies on third-party technology. While considerable technical expertise has been invested in clock circuitry and analog stage design, the level of innovation does not reach industry-leading standards. The high measurement performance is primarily due to optimization of existing technologies rather than fundamental technological innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The Amari's price is approximately 3,000 USD (current market price), but multiple alternative products with equivalent or superior measurement performance exist. Comparing with the most affordable equivalent product, the Schiit Modius E (229 USD), yields 229 USD ÷ 3,000 USD = 0.076. Even comparing with the RME ADI-2 DAC FS (1,299 USD), 1,299 USD ÷ 3,000 USD = 0.433, but based on the most affordable alternative product, the cost-performance evaluation becomes 0.0 (rounded). While the 8×DAC architecture and AFC technology can be evaluated as added value, considering the sound quality improvement effects users can obtain, the practical benefits do not justify the price difference. For extremely limited users who value minute differences in mastering applications, this is a product with remarkably low cost-effectiveness for others.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Antelope Audio has a certain track record as a mid-tier audio manufacturer, but cannot be considered industry-leading. The warranty period is a standard 2 years, with limited domestic support structure. While firmware updates are provided regularly, there are areas where it falls short compared to competitors like RME and Apogee in terms of support response speed and repair system comprehensiveness. Published data on product failure rates is insufficient, making long-term reliability assessment difficult. While it has a track record in professional applications, improvement in after-service quality is expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The direction of achieving transparent-level measurement performance is scientifically rational, but there are questions about the necessity of existing as dedicated equipment. The need to achieve equivalent performance for 3,000 USD is difficult to justify with current technology standards. The 8×DAC architecture is a technically interesting approach, but the relationship between final sound quality improvement effects and invested costs is inefficient. Additionally, equivalent or superior functionality and performance can be achieved with a PC + high-performance DAC combination (total cost around 1,500 USD), diminishing the significance of existing as dedicated equipment. While avoiding claims of unmeasurable effects, excessive specification pursuit that ignores cost efficiency lacks rationality.

## Advice

While the Amari certainly has excellent measurement performance, the 3,000 USD price cannot be recommended for typical audiophiles. Equivalent sound quality improvement effects can be sufficiently achieved with the RME ADI-2 DAC FS (1,299 USD) or Schiit Modius E + Magnius combination (total approximately 545 USD). Purchase should be considered only by mastering engineers for whom minute differences in measurement data have important business significance, or wealthy audiophiles who seek the highest specifications regardless of cost. For general music listening purposes, this is a product with extremely low investment effectiveness. Even if purchasing out of technical interest, we strongly recommend thoroughly considering the balance between practicality and cost. Considering the abundance of alternative products, purchasing at this price cannot be considered a rational decision.
