## Overview

Ultrasone Signature Pure is a budget closed-back, wired headphone positioned beneath the brand’s studio-oriented Signature models. It features 50 mm dynamic drivers, Double Deflector Fins (DDF), and the company’s S-Logic 3 acoustic scheme. Street price is 169 USD. [5][4]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As of August 25, 2025, no independent lab measurements (FR/THD/IMD/Isolation) for Signature Pure could be located. Per policy we start from 0.5 when measured performance is unknown and adjust only on facts. Catalog information confirms 50 mm drivers and S-Logic 3; one official reseller lists a wideband frequency range beyond 20 kHz, but this alone does not establish audibility or transparency. Therefore the score remains a neutral **0.5** pending third-party data. [5]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Proprietary S-Logic 3 driver/earcup geometry and DDF are technically distinctive beyond a basic closed-back design. Construction is fold-flat with practical studio ergonomics. These are incremental—rather than breakthrough—advances, earning **0.6**. [5][4]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better): AKG K361 — 135 USD.**  
Why equivalent-or-better: closed-back, wired headphones with comparable functionality; independent measurements show a balanced response close to target and **low distortion**, i.e., at least on par in core metrics versus the unmeasured Signature Pure. [1][2]

**Calculation** (USD basis):  
CP = 135 USD ÷ 169 USD = 0.7976… → **0.8** (rounded to 1 decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

We did not find a clearly published, global warranty statement for Signature Pure on an official spec page. Build appears conventional for the class (foldable closed-back, detachable cable). Absent broad failure data or a verified warranty policy, we keep this at an average **0.5**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Ultrasone emphasizes S-Logic spatial cues—an acoustic presentation preference—rather than explicitly pursuing transparency benchmarks. That design direction is not inherently harmful, but it prioritizes a particular listening experience over measurement-first neutrality, so **0.4**. [6]

## Advice

If you want the **best objective value** in this price band, start with **AKG K361 (135 USD)** for closer-to-target tonality and measured low distortion. If you can spend slightly more and want an even more target-aligned option, consider **AKG K371**. Keep Signature Pure on your list if you specifically want a **bass-forward** presentation and S-Logic staging. [1][3]
