## Overview

The Ultrasone Signature Master MK II is the flagship model in German manufacturer Ultrasone's Signature series. It features 40mm titanium-coated drivers and incorporates proprietary S-Logic3 and ULE technologies, positioning itself as a studio-oriented headphone. Improvements from the previous model include enhanced comfort and balanced connection support, offered at 775 USD. The design is intended for mastering and mixing applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While the frequency response claims a wide range of 6Hz-42kHz, detailed measurement data is limited despite the 32-ohm specification. The S-Logic3 technology for soundstage control represents a unique approach, but the degree of transparency level achievement remains unclear. For studio monitor applications, specific values for crucial parameters like THD, SNR, and crosstalk are not publicly available, making scientific verification-based evaluation difficult. The adoption of titanium-coated drivers is technically meaningful, but measurable advantages within the audible range are not clearly demonstrated.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The combination of 40mm titanium-coated drivers with proprietary S-Logic3 and ULE technologies demonstrates technical uniqueness. The design philosophy of slightly offsetting drivers rather than centering them in the ear presents an interesting approach. Efforts toward practical improvements are evident through FGC technology for enhanced comfort and 4.4mm balanced connection support. However, quantitative data on how these technologies contribute to final acoustic measurement performance is lacking, falling short of industry-leading standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

At 775 USD, the Sony MDR-7506 with comparable function and use case and published measurement data is available for 100 USD. Calculation: 100 USD รท 775 USD = 0.129, rounded to 0.1. The MDR-7506 shares a similar 32-ohm specification and is designed for comparable studio monitor applications. The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x is also available for 150 USD, recognized for comfort and acoustic isolation. Even considering Ultrasone's proprietary technology, the price gap remains large.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Ultrasone has a track record as an established German headphone manufacturer. However, warranty period and official data on failure rate (RMA) and MTBF for this product are not confirmed. Based on publicly available information, warranty and support are assessed as industry-average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

While there are numerous references to proprietary technologies such as S-Logic3 and ULE technologies, it remains unclear how much these contribute to scientifically verifiable sound quality improvements. The high pricing despite insufficient measurement data disclosure represents a traditional approach of inflating prices as "audio-grade" products. At this price point, significantly superior measured performance can be achieved through combinations of general-purpose equipment, making the necessity for existence as dedicated equipment questionable. The design shows insufficient scientific evidence-based rationality, emphasizing marketing over scientific foundation.

## Advice

This product is intended for enthusiasts attracted to proprietary technologies. However, if studio monitoring is the primary purpose, proven products like the Sony MDR-7506 or Audio-Technica ATH-M50x offer significantly superior cost-performance. With a budget of 775 USD, combining the MDR-7506 with a high-quality headphone amplifier or audio interface would enable construction of a vastly superior system in terms of measured performance and practicality. Unless there is special attachment to the Ultrasone brand, numerous more rational alternatives exist. For those prioritizing practicality and cost-effectiveness over technical curiosity, this product is not recommended.
