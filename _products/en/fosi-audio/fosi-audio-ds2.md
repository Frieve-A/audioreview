## Overview

The Fosi Audio DS2 is a portable USB DAC/amp featuring dual Cirrus Logic CS43131 DAC chips. The 2024 version switched from the previous ESS chips, offering both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs with support for up to 384kHz/32bit PCM and DSD256. It features a CNC-machined metal body and 60-step independent volume control, positioning itself in the portable audio market at 59.99 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measured specifications of THD+N 0.0001%, S/N ratio 130dB, and SINAD 109dB achieve transparent-level performance, demonstrating scientifically valid capabilities. The 1μV noise floor is excellent, providing sufficient quality in the audible range. The dual CS43131 configuration delivers adequate driving power, particularly through the 4.4mm balanced output with 510mW@32Ω. Frequency response remains within ±0.5dB, achieving high-level performance in objective measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The dual CS43131 configuration with SA9312 USB interface demonstrates above-industry-standard technical capability. However, the DAC chips are essentially off-the-shelf components with limited proprietary design elements. The design incorporating practical features like 60-step volume control and LED indicators for playback format display is commendable, but innovative technical elements are not apparent. The CNC-machined housing quality is good, ensuring physical reliability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The DS2 is priced at 59.99 USD (¥9,000), but equivalent-performance competitive products exist. The FiiO KA11 (29.99 USD = ¥4,500, THD+N 0.0006%, S/N ratio 125dB) provides equivalent performance at approximately half the price, while the iFi GO Link Max (79 USD = ¥11,850, THD+N 0.0015%, S/N ratio 130dB) offers equivalent performance at a slightly higher price point. Calculation: ¥4,500 ÷ ¥9,000 = 0.5

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Fosi Audio provides stable product supply and after-sales support, with extensive sales records on major platforms like Amazon. The product failure rate is low, and user reviews report no significant reliability issues. The company maintains an international sales network with appropriate technical support. The standard 1-year product warranty demonstrates above-industry-average reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The dual CS43131 configuration directly contributing to measurement performance improvements represents a rational design decision. The practical approach with both 3.5mm and 4.4mm outputs, practical volume control functionality, and compact housing design specialized for portable use is commendable. No unscientific sound quality improvement claims are present, adopting a design philosophy based on objective measurement values. However, considering the price point, there was room for more aggressive cost reduction.

## Advice

The DS2 is an excellent product in terms of measurement specifications, but faces a challenging position in price competition with competitive products. The half-price FiiO KA11 (29.99 USD) provides practically sufficient performance, while the iFi GO Link Max (79 USD) offers equivalent performance at a slightly higher price. For those considering purchase, it suits users who value the stability of dual CS43131 configuration and Fosi Audio's brand reliability. However, for those seeking pure cost performance, we recommend considering more affordable competitive products. It represents a suitable choice for audiophiles who prioritize measurement data and seek objective performance.
