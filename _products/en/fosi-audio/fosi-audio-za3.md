## Overview

Fosi Audio’s ZA3 is a palm-sized Class-D power amplifier based on TI’s TPA3255. Notable features at this price include a **balanced combo input (XLR/¼" TRS)**, **stereo/mono PBTL switch**, **12V trigger-in**, **active subwoofer out**, and **five DIP8 op-amp sockets** for rolling. With the 48V/5A PSU, the maker specifies **155 W×2 @4Ω (stereo)** or **235 W×1 @4Ω (mono)**, **SINAD 89 dB**, **SNR ≥106 dB**, **THD <0.006%**, and **FR 20 Hz–20 kHz (±0.1 dB)**. Independent measurements confirm generally low distortion/noise but report protection at sustained high power into 4Ω with both channels driven and that the sub-out does **not high-pass** the mains. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Manufacturer specs (with 48V/5A PSU):** SINAD 89 dB, SNR ≥106 dB, THD <0.006%, FR 20 Hz–20 kHz (±0.1 dB), noise floor ≈150 μV; power **155 W×2 (4Ω, stereo)** / **235 W×1 (4Ω, mono)**. [1]  
**Third-party results:** Erin’s Audio Corner shows **load-dependent behavior**; in **4Ω stereo** sustained testing the amp **goes into protect**, while shorter “burst” windows yield higher numbers. The **main speaker outputs are full-range even when sub-out is engaged** (mains not high-passed; sub LPF ≈120 Hz, −3 dB). Test rig: **QA402**, 22.4 kHz BW, 4/8 Ω loads, both channels loaded; reactive loads also evaluated. [2]  
**Interpretation:** Distortion/noise are well below audibility in typical use. Treat 155 W×2 as an **upper bound** rather than continuous 4Ω two-channel sine capability. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

TPA3255 platforms are common, but the ZA3’s **balanced combo input**, **PBTL mono**, **12V trigger**, and **five socketed op-amps** in a compact chassis remain uncommon under 200 USD. The design refines thermal layout (side vents, chassis heatsinking) and modularity without exotic or proprietary silicon. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**ZA3 current price (with 48V/5A PSU): 149.99 USD.** [1]  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (balanced input, comparable “transparent-class” measured behavior):** **AIYIMA A70 — 199 USD**. [3]  
At this time the **ZA3 is the world’s cheapest** product meeting the required **balanced I/O + stereo/mono + measured transparency** set among reputable brands; therefore **CP = 1.0** by rule. [1][2][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Two-year warranty and broad distribution; simple Class-D topology and quality passives (NCC/ELNA, WIMA, Sumida) are positives. **Op-amp rolling is supported but must be done carefully** to avoid instability or damage. [1][2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Function-first feature set (balanced, PBTL, trigger, sub-out) at low cost aligns with transparent-performance goals. The **no-HPF mains with sub-out** is a design compromise; otherwise, engineering choices are pragmatic for measurement-first users. [1][2]

## Advice

Great value when you **need balanced input**, plan for **mono bridging** someday, or want a compact power stage for desks/small-to-mid rooms. For 2.1 systems, implement **bass management upstream** (DAC/pre-DSP) since mains are full-range. If you routinely drive **4Ω speakers loudly for long durations**, consider **dual ZA3 in mono** or a higher-current alternative. [1][2][3]
