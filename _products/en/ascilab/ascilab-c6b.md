## Overview

The AsciLab C6B is a 2-way bookshelf speaker developed by Acoustic Science Laboratory. The company is known for its measurement-focused approach, utilizing precise design and measurement with Klippel NFS (Near Field Scanner) technology. The C6B features a 6-inch aluminum-ceramic composite woofer, a 1-inch aluminum-ceramic dome tweeter, and a 5ร8-inch passive radiator, employing a low crossover frequency of 1.1kHz. With its dedicated waveguide design and extremely low distortion, it is sold for approximately 1100USD per pair.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance of the AsciLab C6B is exceptionally high for the speaker category. Its frequency response extends from 50Hz (-3dB) to over 20kHz, providing ample low-frequency capability for a bookshelf speaker. Particularly noteworthy are its excellent directivity control, thanks to the dedicated waveguide, and its remarkably low distortion across the audible spectrum, even at high volumes. This is a critical factor for accurately reproducing the information in the master recording. The low 1.1kHz crossover also contributes to improved phase characteristics in the midrange, resulting in scientifically validated high acoustic performance overall.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The C6B's technical achievement is excellent by modern speaker design standards. Realizing a 1.1kHz crossover requires advanced optimization of both the tweeter and the woofer. The dedicated waveguide for directivity control is a sophisticated approach, distinct from simple acoustic lenses. In particular, achieving extremely low distortion indicates that the driver units, enclosure design, and crossover are integrated at a high level. The development process using the Klippel NFS measurement system is commendable as a scientific approach that doesn't rely on subjective judgment. However, the product is more an example of refining existing technologies to a high level rather than introducing groundbreaking new technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Considering its absolute performance, the cost-performance of the C6B is very high. A comparable product is the **Neumann KH 80 DSP** (approximately 1000USD per pair), a professional-grade speaker with equivalent or superior measurement performance, especially in low distortion and directivity control. The KH 80 DSP is a powered monitor that boasts industry-leading performance. The C6B, while a passive speaker, comes very close to the KH 80 DSP in performance and is also very similarly priced at 1100USD. The calculation is 1000USD รท 1100USD = 0.909, which rounds to an evaluation of 0.9. This indicates that the C6B offers objective performance value that is commensurate with or exceeds its price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

AsciLab is a relatively new brand with a limited long-term reliability track record. Detailed information about the product warranty and after-sales service system is insufficient, and the status of its global repair network is unclear. However, its development approach emphasizing measurement data and the use of advanced measurement equipment like Klippel NFS suggest a sincere commitment to quality control. Information regarding whether the drivers are developed in-house or sourced externally is not disclosed, leaving ambiguity about the transparency of component-level quality control. While a standard warranty is likely offered, uncertainties remain compared to established manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

AsciLab's design philosophy is extremely rational and scientific. Its approach, based on Klippel NFS measurement data and pursuing performance metrics that directly contribute to audible sound quality, such as directivity control and distortion reduction, is highly commendable. The adoption of a 1.1kHz crossover is also a rational decision based on measurement results. The publication of data and a transparent development process serve as a valuable scientific antithesis to the subjective evaluations prevalent in the audio industry. Its pricing is also reasonable compared to professional equipment with similar performance, ensuring commercial rationality.

## Advice

The AsciLab C6B is a speaker with exceptionally high, data-backed acoustic performance, offering value that matches its price. For users seeking accurate sound reproduction, its low distortion and excellent directivity are particularly compelling features. It holds its own in terms of price-competitiveness even when compared to professional-grade products like the **Neumann KH 80 DSP**. As long as one is not concerned about it being a new brand, the C6B is a highly recommended option for users seeking top-tier performance achieved through a scientific approach. This is not just an expensive speaker; it is a product with clear, justifiable performance for its price.
