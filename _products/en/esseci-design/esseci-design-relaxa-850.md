## Overview

The Relaxa-850 is a magnetic-levitation isolation platform by Esseci Design (Silvano Cremonesi, est. 1999). It floats a tempered-glass shelf on shielded neodymium magnets within an aluminum/iron structure. Effective top-plate size is 550 × 460 mm and rated load is 3–50 kg [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Magnetic suspension mechanically reduces low-frequency, shelf-borne vibration. But for most solid-state digital chains, controlled blind evidence of audibility is lacking. Manufacturer/dealer sources provide load and geometry yet no third-party, controlled ABX data. Published data for a related Relaxa model indicate isolation beginning around 4–8 Hz depending on load—technically meaningful but not sufficient to establish audible improvements across typical electronics [7].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Custom shielded neodymium magnet arrays, precise float alignment, and tempered-glass rigidity show solid mechanical execution. The concept (maglev isolation) is mature; nevertheless, the 50 kg capacity, guided motion, and finish are above commodity feet or foam blocks [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Observed market price: **2,350 USD** (converted from official JP MSRP 352,000円 announced on 2024-06-14) [5]. A **cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative** we verified is **IsoAcoustics OREA Bordeaux**: four units at **89.99 USD each = 359.96 USD**. Function (component isolation) and load handling (32 lb/14.5 kg per unit → 58 kg for four) meet or exceed requirements [2][4][6]. A full-platform alternative—Townshend Seismic Platform—typically lists around 1,290 USD for a single-component platform, reinforcing the weak price leverage of the Relaxa-850 [8][9].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The structure has few wear-prone parts and uses robust materials (tempered glass, aluminum/iron). Warranty for the Relaxa line is noted as **2 years** in reputable coverage, aligning with EU norms [7]. Distribution exists (e.g., US distributor page), though support appears dealer-centric rather than a large direct network [2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Pursuing low-frequency isolation is rational for vibration-sensitive sources (turntables, microphonic tubes). However, broad claims such as eliminating external vibration “of any frequency” overreach available evidence, and comparable isolation for most electronics can be achieved at far lower cost [2][4][6][8].

## Advice

Choose the Relaxa-850 if you specifically want a visually striking, magnetically floating platform with high load capacity and a luxury accessory budget. For **measured isolation per dollar**, consider four **IsoAcoustics OREA Bordeaux** pucks under the component, or a **Townshend Seismic Platform** if you prefer a single rigid platform form factor; both deliver equivalent user-facing isolation with verified load handling at dramatically lower prices [4][6][8][9]. For turntables or microphonic tube gear, prioritize isolation; for modern solid-state sources/amps, set expectations conservatively.
