## Overview

The RAPTGO Hook-X combines a 14.2 mm planar driver with a double-faced multi-layer PZT unit in a semi-open shell and includes a modular 2.5/3.5/4.4 mm cable. Published specs are **15 Ω**, **105 dB SPL/mW**, and **20 Hz–40 kHz** [1][2]. The semi-open build aims for a wider stage at the cost of isolation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Independent reviews consistently report **treble peaks around ~8–10 kHz**, noting potential fatigue [1][2]. Public, comprehensive datasets (e.g., THD vs. SPL, multitone) are **not available**; only basic specs (15 Ω / 105 dB, 20–40 kHz) are widely published [2]. With limited transparent measurement evidence and recurring upper-treble irregularities, the score is set **below** the 0.5 default.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The **planar + PZT** hybrid and semi-open construction reflect substantial engineering ambition, with CNC-machined metal shells and an N52 magnet system reported in vendor materials [1]. Absent verifiable end-to-end measurements or DSP integration, however, it falls short of the top tier.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Per policy, value is judged against the **cheapest generally available product whose *measurement performance is equal or better***, regardless of driver type/class.  
- **TRUTHEAR HOLA — 18.99 USD** official price, with published claims of **low nonlinear distortion (≤0.1% @94 dB)** and **effective FR per IEC60318-4** closely following IEF-Neutral [3].

Hook-X at **239 USD** is thus evaluated as:

**CP = MIN(1.0, 18.99 ÷ 239) = 0.079… → 0.1**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Units sold via major distributors carry **1-year product warranty** and **3-month cable coverage**, per distributor policy [4]. Robust metal shells support physical durability, while newer brand presence and shorter cable coverage temper long-term confidence.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design pursues wider stage and extended treble via a rare driver mix and semi-open acoustics. Execution shows trade-offs: reported treble peaks and scarce measurements constrain the scientific case despite forward-leaning intent [1][2].

## Advice

For listeners curious about a **planar + PZT** flavor and semi-open presentation, Hook-X remains interesting. If you prioritize **measured neutrality and objective performance per dollar**, HOLA presently represents a far better-measured baseline at a fraction of the price [3].
