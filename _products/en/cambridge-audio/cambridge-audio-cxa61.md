## Overview

The Cambridge Audio CXA61 is a discontinued integrated amplifier that combined Class A/B amplification with a built-in ESS SABRE ES9010K2M DAC. Originally launched at 999 USD, the unit delivered 60W per channel into 8 ohms with comprehensive digital and analog connectivity including USB audio supporting up to 32-bit/384kHz PCM and DSD256, Bluetooth aptX HD, and multiple input options. Despite achieving strong measured performance specifications that meet transparent-level criteria, the product's market failure leading to discontinuation, combined with documented reliability issues and poor cost-performance compared to current alternatives, limits its overall evaluation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The CXA61 achieves measured performance that meets or significantly exceeds transparent-level thresholds across key specifications. THD performance is particularly strong at <0.002% at 1kHz and <0.02% from 20Hz-20kHz, well below the 0.01% transparent threshold [1]. Frequency response extends from <5Hz to 60kHz with ±1dB tolerance, exceeding the transparent standard of 20Hz-20kHz ±0.5dB [1]. Signal-to-noise ratio meets the 105dB transparent level with >93dB referenced to 1W into 8 ohms and >105dB at full power [1]. Channel separation exceeds transparent criteria at >80dB below 3kHz, declining to 65dB at the top of the audio band [1]. However, since these measurements represent manufacturer specifications rather than independently verified third-party data, a conservative evaluation approach applies.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The CXA61 employs mature Class A/B amplification technology with competent but not cutting-edge implementation. The ESS SABRE ES9010K2M DAC represents current-generation technology supporting high-resolution formats including DSD256 [1]. Internal design demonstrates technical expertise with toroidal transformer placement, optimized signal paths, and separated left/right channel heat sinks for crosstalk minimization [1]. However, the overall technological approach represents established industry practices rather than innovative advancement. Product discontinuation suggests the technological implementation lacked sufficient competitive differentiation to maintain market position against newer alternatives.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a discontinued product, the CXA61 is available primarily on the used market at approximately 430 USD. Equipped with integrated amplification, built-in high-resolution DAC, and comprehensive connectivity, the CXA61's functionality is matched or exceeded by significantly cheaper alternatives. The SMSL A300 provides equivalent core functionality with 85W/8Ω power output (versus CXA61's 60W/8Ω), built-in DAC, digital inputs, subwoofer output, and remote control operation [2]. CP = 200 USD ÷ 430 USD = 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Cambridge Audio provides 2-year warranty coverage extendable to 30 months through product registration, with global manufacturer support infrastructure [3]. However, multiple user reports document persistent Bluetooth connectivity issues where devices fail to maintain connections or become undetectable, with replacement units exhibiting identical problems [4]. While Cambridge Audio customer service is described as responsive, reported technical problems often remain unresolved. User experience reports indicate that these connectivity issues persist across multiple units.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Cambridge Audio's traditional "Great British Sound" philosophy emphasizes neutral, measurement-focused reproduction aligning with scientific approaches to audio design [5]. Technical implementation demonstrates rational engineering choices including optimized signal paths, appropriate component selection, and effective crosstalk minimization strategies [1]. The combination of Class A/B amplification and ESS SABRE DAC represents a rational design approach that balances measured performance with practical functionality.

## Advice

The CXA61 represents competent traditional integrated amplifier design with measured performance meeting transparent-level criteria. However, current market conditions make purchase inadvisable due to poor cost-performance compared to alternatives providing equivalent or superior functionality at significantly lower prices. Documented reliability issues, particularly with Bluetooth connectivity and electronic controls, create additional ownership risks. Prospective buyers seeking similar functionality should consider current-generation alternatives like the SMSL A300, which provides better power output specifications and equivalent features at approximately one-third the cost, or invest in higher-end options if budget permits.
