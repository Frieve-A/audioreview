## Overview

Cambridge Audio Topaz AM5 was a 25W entry-level integrated amplifier. It provides a front 3.5mm AUX input and four rear RCA inputs, while omitting a remote control, phono input, and headphone output[1][2]. It is discontinued and available only on the used market[4]. Cambridge Audio was founded in 1968.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No credible third-party measurements were found and detailed official measured numbers are not publicly confirmed in accessible documentation[1][2]. The 25W@8Ω rating can be sufficient for efficient small speakers but is often inadequate for many modern designs[1]. Given limited measurement evidence, we keep a mid-level score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The overall design is standard for an entry model with limited originality. Omitting a headphone output and remote while restricting to analog inputs indicates cost optimization rather than technical ambition[1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Used market pricing is around 95–130 USD[4]. As a current alternative with equal-or-better user-facing functions and higher output, Sony STR-DH190 is available at 198 USD and offers 100W@8Ω, built-in phono stage, Bluetooth, five inputs, and a headphone output[5]. Since the review target (AM5) is cheaper, Cost-Performance becomes the capped maximum of 1.0 (denominator is the review target price).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a discontinued model, official support is not expected and used-unit variability and parts availability risks remain[4]. We rate reliability/support below average accordingly.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

While a "minimal features" approach can be sensible, the omission of a headphone output and remote reduces practicality. A phono stage can be added externally if needed. The modest 25W output also narrows applicable use cases[1][2]. Overall rationality for modern usage is low.

## Advice

For those considering the AM5, compare with current models. If found within the used price range above, the price can be attractive, but new models like Sony STR-DH190 (198 USD) provide higher output, phono, Bluetooth, remote, and headphone output[5]. Choosing AM5 is only reasonable for extremely simple setups with efficient small speakers and low-volume listening. Otherwise, prefer current alternatives.
