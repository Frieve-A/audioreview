## Overview

The Accuphase E-280 is the entry-level integrated amplifier in Accuphase's lineup, featuring the proprietary AAVA (Accuphase Analog Vari-gain Amplifier) volume control. Introduced in 2020, it is rated at 90 W/ch into 8 Ω (120 W/ch into 4 Ω), uses a double parallel push-pull stage with bipolar transistors, and offers optional digital input boards for expanded connectivity [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specs indicate 0.05% THD (20 Hz–20 kHz, both channels), line S/N ratio 107 dB, frequency response 20 Hz–20 kHz (+0, −0.5 dB), and damping factor 500 [1][2]. These values are at or near transparent thresholds for an integrated amplifier. Independent third-party lab measurements were not located at the time of writing; therefore, conclusions are provisional pending such data, and the above are explicitly manufacturer specifications [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Accuphase’s AAVA volume control eliminates variable resistors from the signal path by summing multiple V-I converter cells—an original, patented approach that can reduce noise and tracking errors. Additional engineering choices include an instrumentation-amplifier configuration, current-feedback power stage, and logic-controlled short signal paths [1][2]. While competent and distinctive, the design does not integrate modern DSP or software features, so the technological ambition is above average rather than groundbreaking.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Current price: 5,195 USD (review target). The Emotiva BasX TA2—an integrated amplifier with DAC, phono, and tuner—meets or exceeds key performance axes: 135 W/ch into 8 Ω (both channels, 20 Hz–20 kHz, THD < 0.02%), speaker-output S/N > 116 dB, and 20 Hz–20 kHz ±0.15 dB frequency response [5]. **CP = 1,099 ÷ 5,195 = 0.211 → 0.2 (rounded to one decimal).** A cheaper Yamaha A-S801 exists at 999.95 USD, but it does **not** qualify as “equivalent-or-better” on measurement (line S/N 99 dB; FR 10 Hz–100 kHz ±1.0 dB; damping factor 240) despite adequate power and low THD [3][4]. Therefore the TA2 is the valid comparator.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Accuphase is known for robust construction and conservative analog design, and it maintains authorized service networks via distributors. Warranty terms and service costs vary by region, and official long-term failure-rate data were not found. Given high build quality but average global support visibility, reliability/support is assessed as around average for high-end analog integrated amplifiers [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Pursuing low-noise analog control (AAVA) and careful circuit implementation is scientifically defensible. However, allocating significant cost to discrete analog architecture without delivering audibly superior measured transparency over far cheaper integrateds suggests diminishing returns in 2025. Efficient designs now achieve the same or better objective fidelity at a fraction of the cost [3][5].

## Advice

Buyers specifically valuing Accuphase craftsmanship and AAVA’s engineering may accept the price premium. For rational, measurement-first purchasing, Emotiva’s BasX TA2 provides greater power and stronger bench specs with broader functionality at **1,099 USD** [5]. If maximum savings are the priority and slightly lower S/N is acceptable, Yamaha’s A-S801 offers strong power, very low THD, built-in USB DAC support, and a widely available price of **999.95 USD** [3][4]. In most systems, either alternative will achieve transparency comparable to the E-280 while freeing budget for speakers, room treatment, or subwoofers.
