## Overview

The Accuphase E-305 is a vintage integrated amplifier released in December 1987 for ¥270,000. It delivers 130W×2 (8Ω) via a 3-parallel push-pull output stage with six output devices, includes MM/MC phono input and tone controls, and is available only on the used market today.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Measured performance is mixed but in parts near the transparent border. Power amp spec is 130W/8Ω with 0.02% THD (20Hz–20kHz, both channels), which is slightly above the ~0.01% “transparent” mark but still low. Line-stage SNR is 106dB (acceptable), while built-in phono is dated at 86dB (MM) and 66dB (MC). Frequency response is flat within spec. Overall, the line path approaches transparency, but the phono section falls short of modern best practice. [3][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

By current standards the architecture is conventional: discrete Class-AB with relay-switched inputs and DC servos. It lacks modern advances seen in today’s integrateds (far lower noise floors, better protection/efficiency, feature integration). The engineering was solid for 1987, but there’s little technical novelty relative to today.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Cheapest equivalent (user-facing functions + measured performance):**  
- **Emotiva BasX TA2** integrated: 135W/8Ω (both channels, 20Hz–20kHz, THD <0.02%), line SNR >116dB, built-in MM/MC phono. **Price:** 1,099 USD.  
- **+ Schiit Mani 2** phono EQ (external): SNR >98dB (MM), >87dB (MC), RIAA ±0.2dB. **Price:** 149 USD.  
*Equivalence note:* This bundle preserves integrated-amp usage while **matching or exceeding** the E-305’s output power and line-path noise, and **lifting MC phono SNR** well above the E-305’s 66dB. [1][2][3]

**Calculation (USD basis):**  
1,099 USD + 149 USD = **1,248 USD**;  
**1,248 USD ÷ 2,300 USD = 0.5426… → 0.5** (rounded to one decimal).  
Given today’s market, this is the least-cost way we can confirm to achieve equal-or-better functionality and measurement performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Build reputation is strong, but age-related risks (electrolytic aging, switches/relays, semiconductors, service parts) are real. Warranty coverage doesn’t apply to used units, and factory support for products from the 1980s is necessarily limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The E-305 pursued low distortion with substantial, heavy analog hardware—reasonable for 1987. In 2025, achieving transparency is easier, cheaper, and more efficient with modern designs; the older approach offers no measurable user benefit over current integrated solutions.

## Advice

Choose the E-305 primarily for its vintage appeal and tactile experience. For transparent reproduction and value, a **BasX TA2 + Mani 2** combination delivers higher output headroom, far better line SNR, and modern conveniences at close to **half** the E-305’s going price. [1][2]
