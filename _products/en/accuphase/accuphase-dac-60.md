## Overview

The DAC-60 is Accuphase's 6th generation digital input board designed for installation in compatible preamplifiers and integrated amplifiers. Released in late 2021 as successor to the DAC-50, it features dual ESS ES9016K2M DAC chips in parallel configuration with proprietary 2MDS+ implementation. The board supports USB input up to 384kHz/32-bit PCM and DSD256, plus coaxial and optical inputs with automatic switching priority.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No measurement data is publicly available for this product. Credible third-party measurements were not found [1], and manufacturer audio-performance specifications (THD, S/N ratio, frequency response, SINAD, crosstalk) are not published. Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data; the score is 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The DAC-60 demonstrates above-average technology level through confirmed in-house design and proprietary implementations. Accuphase's 2MDS+ Multiple Delta Sigma converter principle and ANCC noise cancellation represent proprietary patent-protected technologies [2]. The dual parallel ES9016K2M configuration shows technical sophistication in implementation. However, the underlying ESS chips are established rather than cutting-edge components, and the technology focuses on refinement of existing approaches rather than breakthrough innovation. The modular board design provides competitive advantage within Accuphase's ecosystem.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Current market price is 1,475 USD [3]. CP = 549.99 USD ÷ 1,475 USD = 0.4. The SMSL D400ES at 549.99 USD provides equivalent-or-better functions based on available specifications. The D400ES offers USB digital input with PCM 768kHz/32-bit support (vs 384kHz/32-bit) and DSD512 support (vs DSD256), plus coaxial and optical inputs matching the DAC-60's core functionality [4]. The D400ES demonstrates SINAD of 120+ dB from Audio Science Review referenced measurements, while the DAC-60's measured performance remains undocumented. No third-party measurements are available for the target product to enable definitive performance comparison, making this evaluation provisional based on functional equivalence.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The DAC-60 benefits from simple robust design as a dedicated DAC input board with minimal moving parts, inherently resistant to failure. Accuphase maintains an established reputation for build quality and reliability. However, support limitations include warranty coverage restricted to country of purchase with no international support, and specific warranty terms are not clearly documented. Repair services are available through authorized distributors and service stations, but parts availability decreases with product age. The 6th generation design indicates iterative refinement suggesting reliability improvements over previous versions.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The DAC-60 demonstrates mixed design philosophy rationality. Positive aspects include measurement-focused approach with emphasis on accuracy and fidelity, reflected in the company name combining "ACCU" (accurate) with "PHASE" [2]. Proprietary ANCC noise cancellation technology and complete in-house design represent scientific approaches to performance improvement. However, the 1,475 USD price for standard ESS chips in parallel configuration represents significant brand premium costs not directly related to function or performance improvements. While the technical implementation is sound, cost allocation heavily favors premium manufacturing and brand positioning over pure performance optimization.

## Advice

For existing Accuphase preamplifier or integrated amplifier owners seeking to add high-resolution digital input capability, the DAC-60 provides seamless system integration with automatic input switching and proven reliability. However, potential buyers should consider that standalone DACs like the SMSL D400ES offer equivalent functionality at significantly lower cost. The DAC-60's value proposition depends entirely on the requirement for Accuphase system integration. New system builders should evaluate whether standalone DAC solutions might provide better overall value than investing in Accuphase's modular approach, especially given the lack of publicly available performance measurements for verification.
