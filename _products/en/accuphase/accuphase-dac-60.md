## Overview

The Accuphase DAC-60 is a digital input card for compatible Accuphase pre/integrated amplifiers. It implements Accuphase’s “2MDS+ (Multiple Delta Sigma)” principle using parallel ES9016K2M DAC chips, and offers USB, optical, and coaxial inputs with support for PCM up to 384 kHz/32-bit and DSD up to 11.2896 MHz (DSD256). Coaxial supports up to 192 kHz/24-bit and optical up to 96 kHz/24-bit. These capabilities are confirmed in Accuphase’s official materials. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Interface support and format ceilings are modern (USB: PCM 384 kHz/32-bit, DSD 11.2 MHz; COAX: 192 kHz/24-bit; OPTICAL: 96 kHz/24-bit). The converter section applies Accuphase’s 2MDS+ with parallel DACs and fully balanced post-filtering, design choices aimed at lowering noise and distortion. While comprehensive third-party device-level measurements (THD+N/SINAD, dynamic range, crosstalk) for DAC-60 are not yet published, the implementation and feature set make **borderline-transparent performance plausible**, pending independent verification. Update this section once credible lab data appears. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design employs an older-generation ESS DAC (ES9016K2M) in a parallel 2MDS+ topology. It is competent but not state-of-the-art relative to current converter architectures. The proprietary card form factor also constrains upgradability versus standalone DACs. [1][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Current market price (review target):** 1,475 USD (US dealer list). [4][5]

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **Topping E30 II** — standalone DAC with USB/optical/coaxial, PCM up to 768 kHz/32-bit and DSD512, plus transparent-class independent measurements. **149 USD** (current market price). [6][7]

**Why equivalent-or-better:** E30 II offers the same user-facing digital inputs (USB/optical/coax) and broader format ceilings; third-party measurements demonstrate transparent fidelity in key metrics. [7]

**CP calculation (required display):**  
149 USD ÷ 1,475 USD = **0.101** → **0.1** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Accuphase has an established reputation for build quality and long-term service via authorized channels. As a plug-in card, the DAC-60 is limited to specific Accuphase hosts, adding system-compatibility constraints relative to universal standalone DACs.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Integrating a DAC as a proprietary card simplifies cabling inside an Accuphase stack, but it ties the user to one ecosystem while employing an older converter platform at a premium price. When functionally equivalent, transparently measuring DACs are widely available at a fraction of the cost, the technical rationale is limited. [6][7]

## Advice

For existing Accuphase owners who value internal integration and aesthetics, the DAC-60 can be convenient. Performance-oriented buyers should consider modern standalone DACs: **Topping E30 II** for maximal value/equivalence, or step up to models with balanced outputs if your system requires them. [6][7]
