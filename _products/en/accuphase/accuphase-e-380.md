## Overview

The Accuphase E-380 is a premium Japanese integrated amplifier produced from 2019 to 2023, delivering 120 watts per channel into 8 ohms and 180 watts into 4 ohms. This stereo integrated amplifier represents Accuphase's refinement of their mid-range offering, featuring the company's proprietary AAVA volume control system and an enhanced power amplification stage with improved damping factor compared to its predecessor. The E-380 blends traditional Japanese high-end audio craftsmanship with modern technical implementations.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The E-380 demonstrates solid measured-performance claims based on manufacturer specifications: THD 0.05%, S/N ratio 109 dB (line), frequency response 20 Hz–20 kHz within +0/−0.5 dB, and damping factor 500 [1]. These meet or exceed transparent thresholds for an amplifier. However, the lack of comprehensive independent third-party bench data for the E-380 limits verification; therefore the score is constrained to manufacturer-claims confidence rather than independently validated results.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The E-380 implements industry-standard integrated amplifier technology with some proprietary elements. The AAVA volume control replaces traditional potentiometers with multiple V-I converter amplifiers to preserve signal quality across volume settings. The power stage uses bipolar transistors in a double parallel push-pull configuration, and the overall topology follows an instrumentation amplifier concept. While competent and mature, these choices are not groundbreaking versus current peers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Prices (current representative market):**
- **Review target (denominator)**: Accuphase E-380 used market, 4,599 USD (example good-condition listing).  
- **Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator (numerator)**: **NAD C 399**, 1,999 USD (base configuration; integrated DAC, Dirac-ready via optional module).  

**Equivalence note (user perspective)**: The NAD C 399 offers the same core user-facing function (integrated stereo amplifier with DAC capability) and meets or exceeds key performance axes (very low distortion, high power into 4/8 Ω with verified lab results), thus qualifying as equal-or-better for CP purposes.

**Calculation**: 1,999 USD ÷ 4,599 USD = 0.4346… → **0.4** (rounded to one decimal).

Result: The E-380 costs well over twice the price of an equal-or-better alternative, yielding **poor cost-performance**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Accuphase maintains an excellent reputation for build quality and long-term support, including extended parts availability and conservative, robust designs. While repair costs can be high due to premium parts and labor, the brand’s service network and historically durable construction justify an above-average score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design focuses on parameters that correlate with fidelity (low THD, high damping factor) and employs a rational, low-noise volume control system (AAVA). However, the pricing strategy emphasizes luxury construction and brand prestige without measurable performance advantages over significantly cheaper competitors, limiting rationality at the product level.

## Advice

From a rational fidelity-per-dollar standpoint, the E-380 is a poor buy. For ~1,999 USD, NAD’s C 399 delivers comparable or better measured transparency and power with broader digital functionality; the E-380’s large price premium is not justified by audible performance gains. Consider the E-380 **only** if you explicitly prioritize Accuphase’s aesthetics, build, and brand heritage over value.
