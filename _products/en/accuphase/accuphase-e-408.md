## Overview

The Accuphase E-408 is a high-end integrated amplifier released in 2003. It delivers 180W×2 (8Ω) and employs a triple parallel push-pull output stage with MCS topology and a current-feedback circuit. The unit features a champagne-gold chassis weighing 23.4kg. Expandability is provided via optional modules for phono input and DAC functionality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The E-408 demonstrates excellent measurement performance. Specifications of THD 0.02%, SNR 113dB, and damping factor 120 represent good performance that significantly exceeds problematic levels, though falling short of transparency thresholds. The frequency response of 2Hz-150kHz and 0.02% distortion provide meaningful improvement effects for human hearing. However, compared to modern Class D amplifiers (SINAD 120dB+) and digital equipment, the SNR of 113dB receives moderate evaluation by contemporary standards. While the triple parallel push-pull configuration for low distortion is technically effective, absolute measurement performance doesn't reach modern reference equipment levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The unique design combining MCS topology with current feedback circuitry was advanced technology for 2006. The triple parallel push-pull output stage for distortion reduction and logic-controlled relay signal path optimization represent rational technology investment directly contributing to measurement performance improvement. The custom-designed output stage and integrated preamp-power amp design eliminate degradation from external connections, demonstrating technical excellence. The expandable design accommodating optional modules is also technically commendable from a system optimization perspective. However, from today's viewpoint, this represents above-industry-standard achievement rather than breakthrough innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Against the E-408's current used price of 2,200 USD, an equivalent integrated amplifier with preamp function, volume control, and multiple inputs exists in the NAD C 399 (2,000 USD). Calculation: 2,000 USD ÷ 2,200 USD = 0.91, rounded to 0.9. The NAD C 399 provides 180W×2 output and multiple analog/digital inputs (including MM phono input) with integrated volume control. It offers output capability comparable to the E-408 for common applications.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Accuphase maintains high industry evaluation for product reliability as an established Japanese audio manufacturer with long-term business continuity. While the E-408's manufacturing period was limited to 2006-2010, failure reports for other company products under long-term use are relatively few, offering expectation of Japanese manufacturing quality control. However, with over 15 years since manufacturing cessation, uncertainties regarding parts supply and repair support are increasing. Warranty periods and current support systems may face limitations compared to new product purchases. While continuous business operations reduce complete support cessation risk, considerations for older product-specific risks are necessary.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The E-408's design philosophy represents a rational approach emphasizing measurement performance improvement. The combination of MCS topology and current feedback circuitry, plus triple parallel push-pull configuration, all directly contribute to distortion reduction and bandwidth improvement, representing scientifically grounded design decisions. Logic-controlled relay signal path optimization rationally minimizes contact resistance and path length degradation. Optional module accommodation enabling function expansion based on usage represents good design philosophy balancing versatility and optimization. As of 2025, equivalent performance can be achieved through established Class D technology and digital processing, but the dedicated audio equipment maintains reasonable existence significance.

## Advice

The E-408 demonstrates excellent measurement performance and manufacturing quality, making it a viable option for 2025 purchase decisions. Against the 2,200 USD investment, note that equivalent integrated amplifier functionality is available with the NAD C 399 (2,000 USD). The E-408's 180W output is advantageous for large speakers or high-volume playback and is sufficient for general applications. For pure sound-quality cost-performance, the NAD C 399 is a modern alternative.
