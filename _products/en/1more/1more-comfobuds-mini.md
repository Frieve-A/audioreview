## Overview

The 1MORE ComfoBuds Mini is an ultra-compact ANC-equipped wireless earphone developed by Chinese audio equipment manufacturer 1MORE. Released in 2022, it features a lightweight design of 3.7g per unit and compact size as its primary characteristics, marketed as the "world's smallest active noise-canceling earphones." It employs a 7mm dynamic driver with graphene diaphragm and dual magnetic circuit design, offering up to 40dB noise canceling performance and IPX5 water resistance. It also includes SoundID support for personalized sound experiences and sleep sound functionality with 30 types of natural sounds.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The official specifications claim ANC performance of up to 40dB, and third-party measurements have confirmed good noise canceling performance. While achieving the excellent level (30dB or higher) according to the measurement results criteria table, it falls short of industry-leading standards, placing it in the mid-to-upper performance range. Regarding acoustic performance from the 7mm driver, specific numerical data for THD, SNR, and frequency characteristics are not disclosed, making objective evaluation difficult. Physical constraints from miniaturization inevitably affect acoustic performance, and scientifically verifiable sound quality improvement effects are considered limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The graphene diaphragm and dual magnetic circuit design represent modern approaches but are not particularly innovative technologies within the industry. While the 3.7g weight reduction is engineering-wise commendable, its contribution to acoustic performance is limited. Bluetooth 5.2, AAC support, and Qi-compatible wireless charging are standard features with no observed technical advantages. The SoundID function for sound quality customization can be evaluated as added value but does not contribute to fundamental acoustic performance improvement. Overall, it is evaluated as industry-average technology level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Cost-performance evaluation requires verification of current market pricing for accurate comparison. While competitor analysis identified the EarFun Air Pro 4 as offering equivalent or superior ANC performance (verified 50dB), technical specifications (Bluetooth 5.4, aptX Lossless, 52-hour battery life), and features, current verified pricing data for both the ComfoBuds Mini and EarFun Air Pro 4 in the Japanese market could not be confirmed through available sources. Without verified pricing information, an objective cost-performance calculation cannot be conducted according to review policy standards. The evaluation score reflects this limitation in pricing verification rather than product performance assessment.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While 1MORE has established a certain market position as a Chinese manufacturer, support structure within Japan is limited. Product warranty periods and specific failure rate data are not disclosed, making objective evaluation of long-term reliability difficult. IPX5 water resistance is adequate for daily use but cannot be considered industry-leading. Information regarding firmware update support is also insufficient, presenting concerns about long-term support structure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The ultra-miniaturization approach represents a rational direction addressing certain user needs, but compromises are evident in balancing with acoustic performance. Physical constraints make adoption of larger drivers difficult, creating limitations in sound quality aspects. While ANC functionality incorporation addresses modern requirements, optimal performance delivery is challenging due to miniaturization constraints. Though the significance as dedicated audio equipment is recognized, with higher-performance options existing in the same price range, design philosophy rationality remains at moderate evaluation levels.

## Advice

The 1MORE ComfoBuds Mini is suitable for users who prioritize lightweight comfort and inconspicuous appearance above all else. The 3.7g weight is a definite advantage, expected to provide minimal fatigue during extended wear. Sleep-time use and sound quality customization through SoundID functionality are also valuable as added benefits. However, for those prioritizing sound quality and functionality, thorough market research is recommended to identify competitive alternatives. The EarFun Air Pro 4 demonstrates superior technical specifications including verified 50dB ANC performance, 52-hour battery life, Bluetooth 5.4, and aptX Lossless support. Before purchase, it is important to verify current market pricing for accurate cost-performance comparison, clarify priority levels for lightweight design versus acoustic performance, and conduct comprehensive comparative evaluation with verified specifications and pricing data.
