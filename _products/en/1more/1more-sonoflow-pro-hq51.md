## Overview

The 1MORE SonoFlow Pro HQ51 is a wireless ANC headphone released by Chinese company 1MORE in 2024. Equipped with DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) composite drivers and LDAC support for hi-res audio playback, this product aims for professional sound quality at an affordable price of 85 USD. The QuietMax dual-feed ANC technology achieves noise reduction of 42dB or more, while offering extended playback times of 100 hours with ANC off and 65 hours with ANC on.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The LDAC support and nominal -42dB ANC performance are scientifically valid in terms of maintaining information during wireless transmission and removing external noise, respectively. The ANC performance, in particular, reaches the ideal level in our transparency standards. However, specific measurements for core sound quality metrics like Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) are not published, making the effect of the DLC driver adoption unknown. As the published specs alone cannot guarantee the achievement of a transparent level, we rate it as securing an average level of validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 40mm DLC composite driver achieves both higher rigidity and weight reduction compared to conventional resin-based diaphragms, with technical rationality contributing to improved distortion characteristics. The QuietMax dual-feed ANC design achieves higher control precision than typical feedforward-only systems. Bluetooth 5.4 and LDAC support technically ensure high-quality transmission in a wireless environment. However, these are combinations of existing technologies, with limited innovative technological elements from proprietary development. It demonstrates design standards above the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Compared to the OneOdio Focus A6 (69 USD) which has equivalent functionality, the calculation yields 69 USD รท 85 USD = 0.81. The Focus A6 offers superior specifications with 48dB ANC performance, LDAC support, and Bluetooth 6.0 at a lower price. However, the 1MORE product maintains competitiveness in overall completeness with its 246g lightweight design, 100-hour battery life, and Hi-Res Audio certification. While not the absolute lowest price, the balance between quality and price is at a reasonable level.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

1MORE is a relatively new company founded in 2013, but has financial stability backed by Xiaomi investment. In the Japanese market, they have established a sales system through official distributors, with product warranties and after-sales support at industry-standard levels. Firmware update support is also implemented, showing a commitment to continuous product improvement. However, compared to established Western manufacturers, long-term reliability track record is limited. As an emerging manufacturer, they have built an appropriate support system.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design rationally combines scientifically confirmed sound quality improvement technologies: distortion reduction through DLC diaphragm adoption, high-quality wireless transmission via LDAC support, and external noise removal through dual-feed ANC. Technical choices are made toward achieving transparency levels in our evaluation standards, with occult elements eliminated. The 100-hour long battery life is also a rational design directly linked to practical improvement. The development policy emphasizing balance between price and performance to achieve cost-performance excellence is also commendable.

## Advice

The 1MORE SonoFlow Pro HQ51 is suitable for those seeking genuine hi-res support and ANC functionality at the 85 USD price point. LDAC support enables high-transparency sound quality for hi-res audio playback on Android smartphones and Walkman devices. The ANC performance of 42dB or more is sufficient for commuting and school use, while the 100-hour battery life significantly reduces charging frequency. However, the more affordable OneOdio Focus A6 also offers equivalent or superior specifications, so comparison is recommended for those prioritizing absolute cost-performance. For those who emphasize the overall balance of sound quality, functionality, and design, and who seek official support in Japan, this represents an appropriate choice.
