## Overview

Loxjie’s 2024 D30 refresh is a compact DAC/headphone-amp with USB, optical, and coaxial inputs plus Bluetooth 5.1. It uses ESS’s ES9039Q2M DAC with an XMOS XU-316 USB controller, offers seven PCM digital filters, supports up to 32-bit/768 kHz PCM and DSD512, and implements **full MQA decoding** (including MQA-CD over S/PDIF). Bluetooth uses Qualcomm QCC5125 with LDAC and aptX/HD alongside AAC/SBC. A preamp mode (up to 2.5 Vrms line out) is available, and the headphone stage is specified at up to 1.5 W×2 into 32 Ω with power ratings across 16–600 Ω loads [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent lab data for the **2024** unit are not yet available; the figures below are manufacturer-documented. Line out is specified at **THD+N 0.00008 % (−121 dB)** with **dynamic range/SNR 125 dB**; headphone out **0.0001 % (−118 dB)** and **122 dB**—all comfortably transparent against common audibility thresholds. Rated power: **3 W×2 (16 Ω)**, **1.5 W×2 (32 Ω)**, **380 mW×2 (150 Ω)**, **190 mW×2 (300 Ω)**, **95 mW×2 (600 Ω)**. USB supports up to **32-bit/768 kHz** PCM and **DSD512**; S/PDIF up to **192 kHz** and **DSD64 (DoP)** [1]. For historical context only, the **older 2021 D30** measured **~114 dB SINAD** on ASR [6].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Current-gen platform (ES9039Q2M + XU-316, LDAC-capable BT, full MQA, seven PCM filters, preamp mode). The design targets transparent performance and broad connectivity rather than novel DSP or unusual form factors [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better we could verify):** **SMSL C200 Pro**—integrated DAC/amp with **ES9039Q2M**, **full MQA decoding**, **LDAC Bluetooth**, and output power up to **1.5 W×2 (32 Ω)**; current street around **183–199 USD** [3][4].  
**D30 2024 representative market price (US):** **170 USD** (retail listing) [5].

**Equivalence note:** C200 Pro matches D30’s user-visible functions (USB/S/PDIF/BT with LDAC, **full MQA**, DAC+headphone amp, pre-out) and manufacturer specs meet or exceed key transparency metrics [3].

**Result:** With no cheaper truly equivalent product found (C200 Pro is higher priced than D30 at time of writing), **CP = 1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Mainstream silicon and a simple desktop design favor reliability. Distributor listing states **warranty 1 year (2 years in Europe)**; official support pages provide drivers/manuals [2][5].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Emphasis on measurable transparency and practical connectivity (USB/S/PDIF/BT with LDAC) plus compatibility via full MQA is a rational, user-oriented approach at this price [1][2].

## Advice

An excellent “one-box” desktop pick if you specifically want **LDAC Bluetooth** and **full MQA** together with enough headphone power for most dynamics/planars and a usable pre-out. If you don’t need MQA, non-MQA options (e.g., Topping DX3 Pro+) may be attractive but are not function-equivalent for CP purposes.
