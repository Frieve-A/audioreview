## Overview

The LOXJIE D10 is a compact triangular-shaped DAC/headphone amplifier combo featuring an ESS ES9038Q2M SABRE DAC chip with XMOS XU208 USB interface. Released by the relatively young LOXJIE Audio brand (founded 2017), this 129 USD desktop unit supports high-resolution audio up to 32-bit/768kHz PCM and DSD512, targeting entry-level audiophiles seeking transparent reproduction in a distinctive form factor.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The D10 shows strong DAC performance alongside a limited headphone amplifier. Manufacturer specifications list RCA line-out **THD+N 0.0003%** and **SNR 115 dB**, while the headphone output is rated **THD+N 0.003%**, **SNR 105 dB**, and **100 mW @ 32 Î©**, which is consistent with a competent DAC section but a modest amp stage. Independent testing (Audio Science Review) reports that the DAC "nearly aces" objective tests and notes the typical ESS **IMD hump**, whereas the headphone amp delivers relatively low power and struggles with low-impedance loads-distortion rises and current delivery is limited; performance improves with high-impedance headphones but remains shy of transparent targets.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The D10 employs mainstream 2019-era building blocks (ESS ES9038Q2M DAC; XMOS XU208 USB). The analog stage uses a discrete **MTCAC** (Multi-Chip Current Amplifying Circuit) in Class-AB. These are proven, off-the-shelf approaches without notable innovation. The triangular "Toblerone" chassis is distinctive but confers no functional advantage; the aluminum CNC casework is appropriate for the price but not unique.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At **129 USD**, among DAC/amp combos that support up to **32-bit/768 kHz PCM** and **DSD512**, the D10 undercuts well-known alternatives that meet or exceed its functions and measurements, such as **FiiO K5 Pro ESS** (MSRP **179.99 USD**) and **TOPPING DX3 Pro+** (commonly **199 USD**). Within verified, generally available products offering the same high-resolution support and integrated headphone amplification, we did not find a lower price; therefore the D10 attains best-in-class cost-performance for this capability set.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Multiple user reports describe Windows driver recognition issues (especially on Windows 11) and severe firmware-update problems (e.g., playback speed errors), with slow or absent vendor responses. Workarounds have included installing different device firmware. Such reports suggest uneven quality control and support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

LOXJIE prioritizes measurable transparency using a standard ESS implementation at a low price-an overall rational direction. Execution, however, reveals a limited headphone amp and support challenges that blunt the otherwise measurement-driven aim.

## Advice

For buyers seeking an entry-level **high-resolution DAC/amp**, the D10 offers standout value but with caveats. Pairing with **high-impedance** headphones tends to yield better results; users of **low-impedance** or sensitive IEMs should consider alternatives due to the amp's constraints. If you need only a high-performance DAC (no headphone amp), consider DAC-only units around this price for better reliability.
