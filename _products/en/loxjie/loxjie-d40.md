## Overview

The Loxjie D40 is a desktop DAC and headphone amplifier featuring dual ESS ES9068AS in a balanced topology with USB/coax/optical inputs and LDAC-capable Bluetooth. It supports PCM up to 32-bit/768kHz, DSD512, and full MQA decoding[4][5]. It targets users seeking a one-box solution for hi-res playback and headphone driving.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent testing reports low noise and distortion with textbook linearity across the audible band, and better performance on balanced outputs; single-ended also meets transparency[1]. As a general comparison context, ASR’s Master SINAD chart for DACs provides an overview of measured transparency tiers where the D40-class devices reside[3]. The built-in headphone stage is serviceable though less ambitious than the DAC stage[1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A solid, contemporary implementation: dual ES9068AS, XMOS USB interface, quality op-amps, wide-format support, and practical I/O[4][5]. There is limited proprietary innovation beyond competent integration of mature technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Comparator (cheaper, equivalent-or-better)**: Topping DX5 II — dual ES9039Q2M, PEQ, LDAC, comprehensive I/O; independently measured transparent DAC performance and markedly higher headphone power[6][8].  
**Market prices**: DX5 II 299 USD (US street/list)[6][7]; D40 430 USD (this review’s denominator).  
**Equivalence note**: Matching hi-res/DSD capability, low-noise/low-distortion measurements, plus feature advantage (PEQ) and far higher output capability (up to 7,600mW @16Ω; 6,400mW @32Ω, balanced)[6].  
**Calculation**: CP = 299 USD ÷ 430 USD = 0.70 → score aligned at 0.7.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Aluminum chassis, fanless design, typical warranty and distribution, and firmware support provide a standard reliability baseline for long-term use[4][5].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Parts selection and feature set focus on audible transparency and real-world usability rather than cosmetic excess. Balanced/SE flexibility and LDAC support reflect practical priorities[4][5].

## Advice

Choose the D40 if you specifically need **full MQA decoding** and **balanced XLR line out** in a single box. If you value **higher headphone power** and **built-in PEQ** at a lower price, the **Topping DX5 II** is a stronger value in most desktop scenarios[6][8][7].
