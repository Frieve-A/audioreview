## Overview

The Loxjie A30 is a compact integrated amplifier that combines a Class-D power stage, a USB/optical/coaxial DAC, Bluetooth input, and a 6.35 mm headphone jack in one box. It uses Infineon’s MA12070 amplifier platform with an ESS ES9023 DAC and an NJW1194 electronic volume/tone control. Connectivity covers USB audio (up to 32-bit/384 kHz), optical/coaxial S/PDIF, RCA line-in, and Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX, plus a subwoofer pre-out and remote control [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent bench results show competent—but not state-of-the-art—amplifier performance. Audio Science Review measured roughly **low-80 dB SINAD** via digital inputs and about **~40 W into 4 Ω before clipping**, consistent with typical MA12070 implementations; analog-in performance measures lower than digital-in per the same review discussion [1]. Manufacturer/retailer documentation confirms **USB 32-bit/384 kHz** support and the internal parts set (ES9023, NJW1194) but does not substantiate higher SINAD figures [2]. The built-in headphone output exists and works but is limited in drive compared to dedicated headphone amps; users with insensitive or high-impedance headphones should plan accordingly [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The A30 adopts proven 2019–2020-era building blocks (Infineon MA12070 Class-D, ESS ES9023, NJW1194). The feature mix—USB/S/PDIF DAC, aptX Bluetooth, sub-out, remote, on-device EQ—is practical and up-to-date, but there is no novel circuit technique or new measurement milestone beyond standard integrated desktop designs [2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Cheapest fully equivalent alternative (functions + measured performance)** found at this writing is a **two-box bundle**:

- **AIYIMA D03** (USB/optical/coax DAC + Class-D speaker amp + Bluetooth with aptX family; manufacturer specs THD+N 0.001% @1 kHz/1 W, SNR 93 dB) at **143.99 USD** [3]  
- **Behringer HA400** compact headphone amp at **24.90 USD** [4]  
→ Combined **168.89 USD** achieving the same user-visible functions (digital/BT inputs, speaker amp, **plus headphone out**) and broadly equivalent measured fidelity for general desktop use ([1] vs [3]).

**CP calculation (explicit):** 168.89 USD ÷ 169.99 USD = **0.993…** → score **1.0** after rounding to one decimal.  
*(Note: If you don’t require a headphone jack, the single-box D03 at 143.99 USD would yield ~0.85.)*

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Construction is a simple, cool-running Class-D platform with an external PSU, which tends to aid reliability. Formal long-term failure data and an official global warranty term were not verified from the manufacturer at the time of writing; support typically runs through retailers/distributors. Fit/finish is decent for desktop duty [2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The A30 prioritizes **integration and convenience** (DAC + BT + tone controls + sub-out + headphone) over chasing the very highest bench numbers. That’s a rational choice for desktop users wanting one box, but it does limit ultimate headphone power and leaves amplifier SINAD below transparent benchmarks [1][2].

## Advice

If you want a neat **all-in-one** to feed passive speakers from USB/S/PDIF/BT and occasionally use **easy-to-drive** headphones, the A30 works well. For stronger headphone drive, add a dedicated headphone amp (or consider a different all-in-one). If pure **value** is your focus, the AIYIMA D03 (+ a small headphone amp if needed) undercuts the A30’s price while matching functions and practical fidelity in typical use [3][4].
