## Overview

The Loxjie A40 is a 2024 all-in-one Class D integrated amplifier built around Infineon's MERUS MA5332MS power stage. It combines a USB DAC (Cirrus Logic CS43131 via XMOS XU316), HDMI ARC, Bluetooth 5.1 with LDAC/aptX HD, a subwoofer out, dual headphone jacks (6.35 mm and 4.4 mm), and—unusually at this size—a phono input. Rated output is 165 W ×2 into 4 Ω (THD+N <1%). Street price is 255 USD. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent lab measurements are not yet widely published. Manufacturer-published specifications list THD+N (A-weighted) at 0.003%, SNR (A-weighted) at 107 dB, and channel separation at 98 dB, alongside 165 W ×2 (4 Ω) and 85 W ×2 (8 Ω). USB supports PCM up to 32-bit/768 kHz and DSD256; MQA and MQA-CD decoding are reported over USB/S/PDIF. These figures, if met, are at or near transparent thresholds for audibility; pending third-party verification, we provisionally set scientific validity slightly above the unknown-data baseline. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design uses current, mainstream parts (MA5332MS power stage, CS43131 DAC, XMOS XU316 USB interface, NJW1194 electronic volume) and a Qualcomm QCC5125 BT receiver supporting LDAC/aptX HD. Useful integrations include separate speaker/headphone volume memories, eight EQ presets, and five digital filters. Solid, but not indicative of proprietary breakthroughs. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price is 255 USD. We looked for cheaper integrated units offering **equal-or-better user functions** (HDMI ARC + phono + USB DAC + BT with LDAC + dual headphone outs + sub out) and **not worse core specs** (e.g., THD+N around 0.003%, SNR ≥105 dB). We did not find a cheaper match. The closest mainstream alternative, SMSL AO300, offers a very similar platform (MA5332MS, CS43131, XU-316, HDMI ARC, dual HP outs, LDAC) but **omits a phono input** and typically sells for 289 USD. Therefore, no cheaper equivalent-or-better option exists and CP is set to 1.0. [1][3][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Long-term failure-rate data and MTBF figures are not published. The architecture (switch-mode power with few moving parts) is generally robust, but the brand's relatively short history and limited public reliability statistics keep confidence at a cautious level. We will revise when dependable multi-unit field data becomes available.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The A40's feature integration is practical and user-oriented: HDMI ARC for TV, onboard phono to consolidate vinyl setups, a competent USB DAC path, dual headphone outputs, and configurable EQ/filters—without resorting to non-scientific claims. MQA/MQA-CD support is present as a format feature rather than an asserted audible upgrade. Overall, it channels cost into measurable functionality. [1][2]

## Advice

If you want one compact box to handle TV, computer, Bluetooth, headphones, and a turntable, the A40 is unusually complete and powerful for the money. Its phono input makes it a convenient vinyl hub, and HDMI ARC simplifies TV hookups. If you require bullet-proof reliability data or independently verified top-tier lab numbers, monitor upcoming third-party measurements or consider more established lines at higher prices.
