## Overview

The Loxjie D60 is a desktop DAC and headphone amplifier built around ESS Technology’s ES9039MSPRO DAC. It supports PCM up to 32-bit/768 kHz, DSD512, and includes built-in MQA decoding (retailer notes MQA-CD as well). It provides three headphone outputs (6.35 mm single-ended, 4.4 mm balanced, and 4-pin XLR balanced) plus extensive digital inputs and balanced/unbalanced line outputs, targeting users who want an all-in-one desktop solution. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specifications list THD+N of 0.00005% (-125 dB), SNR/DNR of 132 dB, PCM up to 32-bit/768 kHz and DSD512. The integrated headphone amplifier is specified at 6 W per channel into 16 Ω (balanced). These figures align with transparency-level expectations, but as of this writing we have not found third-party bench measurements specific to the D60; therefore this assessment relies on manufacturer/retailer data and remains provisional. [1][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The D60 uses current-generation components: ES9039MSPRO DAC, XMOS XU-316 USB interface, and a fully balanced headphone amplifier. Signal conditioning employs multiple OPA1612 op-amps. It offers seven PCM and four DSD digital filter options. Wireless input is Bluetooth 5.1 with support for LDAC and aptX-HD (per product pages). Overall implementation is modern for the class. [1][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Price basis for this review:** 399 USD (derived from a confirmed Japan market price of **62,000 円** on Amazon.co.jp; rounded to USD for consistency). [4]

As the **cheapest equivalent-or-better** alternative, **TOPPING DX5 II** is broadly available at **299 USD** and offers **three headphone outputs (6.35 mm, 4.4 mm, 4-pin XLR)**, LDAC Bluetooth 5.1, and very strong stated output power (up to **7600 mW ×2 @16 Ω** balanced). Functional parity and headline specs meet or exceed the D60. [5][6][7]  
**Cost-performance calculation:** 299 USD ÷ 399 USD = 0.749 → **0.7**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Loxjie is a relatively new brand with growing international distribution. Typical warranty coverage is around one year via dealers; firmware updates exist for digital sections, but long-term support history is limited, and there’s limited independent reliability data for the D60 at this time.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The D60 emphasizes measurable performance with a modern flagship DAC, balanced amplification, and practical I/O. Multiple digital filters and broad connectivity add versatility, prioritizing technical merit (distortion, noise floor, and power) over subjective claims.

## Advice

The D60 suits users needing an integrated DAC/headphone amp with high output power and broad connectivity. If you prioritize value at similar capability, TOPPING’s DX5 II is meaningfully cheaper while retaining triple headphone outputs, LDAC BT, and robust power on paper. The D60 remains reasonable if you specifically want its form factor and feature set at its prevailing price point.
