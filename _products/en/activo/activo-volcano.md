summary: "A triple dynamic driver IEM from Activo, a subsidiary of Astell&Kern. While it offers multiple connector options for approximately 85 USD, it faces significant cost-performance challenges, as the highly-regarded 7Hz Salnotes Zero:2 offers excellent measured performance for around 25 USD."

## Overview

The Activo Volcano is an in-ear monitor developed by Activo, a subsidiary of Astell&Kern. It adopts a triple dynamic configuration with one 8mm driver and two 6mm drivers, featuring 16Ω impedance and 100dB/mW sensitivity with a 20Hz-20kHz frequency response. The lightweight polycarbonate housing is combined with a high-quality cable, offering multiple connection options including 3.5mm, 4.4mm, and USB-C terminals. Priced at approximately 85 USD (12,400 JPY), it is positioned in the mid-range IEM market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While the Volcano's technical specifications cover the basic audible range, detailed third-party measurement data to verify performance, such as THD and S/N ratio, is not publicly available. Although the nominal specs are standard, the lack of objective evidence required to confirm transparent-level sound quality means the evaluation remains at an average score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The triple dynamic driver configuration is a technically rational approach, but it has already become standardized in the industry. The 8mm + 6mm×2 configuration has a theoretical basis for frequency division, and the hybrid cable of silver-plated copper wire and oxygen-free copper is appropriately designed. The provision of multiple connection terminals enhances practicality, but these technical elements are standard in today's mid-range IEM market, with no notable uniqueness or advancement observed. It is evaluated as having an industry-average technology level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The cost-performance is extremely low when compared to competing products with equivalent or superior functionality. For instance, the 7Hz Salnotes Zero:2, which has a strong reputation for its excellent measured performance, is available for around 25 USD. Calculation formula: 25 USD ÷ 85 USD = 0.294 (rounded to 0.3). Differences in driver configuration are not an essential differentiator from a user's perspective when a much cheaper alternative provides superb performance, making this product's price unjustifiable.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A one-year product warranty is provided, backed by the reliability of its parent company, Astell&Kern. Astell&Kern is an established Korean audio manufacturer with an industry track record. However, the Activo brand itself has a limited market track record, and sufficient evidence has not been accumulated regarding its specialized support systems or firmware update frequency (where applicable). It is evaluated as having reliability and support systems slightly above the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The triple dynamic configuration that divides drivers by frequency band is acoustically rational. The provision of multiple connection terminals responds to actual user needs, reflecting a design philosophy that emphasizes practicality. The adoption of a polycarbonate housing is also a rational decision considering the balance between weight reduction and durability. No unscientific "audio mythology" claims are observed, adopting a design approach aimed at measurable performance improvements. Overall, it represents a rational design philosophy based on scientific evidence.

## Advice

The Activo Volcano is a technically rational mid-range IEM, but it suffers from a severe price competitiveness problem. Considering that superior performance can be achieved with the 7Hz Salnotes Zero:2 for about 25 USD, purchasing the Volcano at 85 USD is economically irrational. It can only be an option for those who prioritize the Astell&Kern brand reliability and require official support, but it cannot be recommended in terms of the pure performance-to-price ratio. With the same budget, combining the 7Hz Salnotes Zero:2 with a high-performance USB DAC would be a far more effective investment.
