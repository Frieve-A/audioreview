## Overview

The Klipsch R-15M is an entry-level bookshelf speaker from the Reference series (built from 2014) pairing a 1-inch aluminum compression tweeter on a 90°×90° Tractrix horn with a 5.25-inch copper-spun IMG woofer in an MDF enclosure. Manufacturer specifications list 62 Hz–24 kHz (±3 dB), 94 dB sensitivity (2.83 V/1 m), and 1.8 kHz crossover. Originally MSRP was 249 USD. As a compact, high-efficiency passive speaker, it targets users needing easy drive with modest amplifiers and a small footprint. [2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent in-room measurements show a -3 dB point around 47–53 Hz at 1–2 m and controlled on-axis response with a notable ~13–13.5 kHz peak. Distortion at 75 dB SPL averages ~2.05% from 63 Hz–16 kHz, with 2.08% at 63 Hz and a 10% local maximum near 107 Hz; below port tuning (≈63 Hz) THD rises sharply. These data indicate competent but not transparent performance for a passive 2-way bookshelf, aligning with speaker-category application notes where THD ≲1% is excellent and ≥1% becomes problematic. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design employs mature, well-understood technologies: square Tractrix horn loading, aluminum compression tweeter, IMG cone woofer, rear bass-reflex port, and conventional MDF construction at a 1.8 kHz crossover. No clear proprietary innovations or integration of recent advanced computation/DSP are present beyond established Reference-series practices. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price for the R-15M pair is 199 USD (new/B-stock). Among passive bookshelf speakers with equal-or-better measured performance, the cheapest widely available comparator we verified is JBL Stage A130 at 299.95 USD. Equipped with 2-way bookshelf configuration, third-party CTA-2034 (Klippel NFS) measurements show the A130 achieves equal-or-better frequency-response linearity and controlled directivity versus R-15M. No cheaper equal-or-better option was found today, therefore CP reaches the ceiling and is set to 1.0. [4][5][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Simple two-way topology and robust MDF cabinetry reduce failure points. Klipsch’s global dealer/support footprint and the availability of official service manuals for the 2015 Reference family (including R-15M) support maintainability. As a passive speaker, firmware risk is irrelevant. Long-term durability concerns are typical of the class (e.g., cosmetic finish, potential cone damage) rather than design-specific. [3][6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

High sensitivity and horn-controlled directivity are rational engineering choices to achieve wide SPL from modest power and stable radiation patterns in small rooms. The trade-off is a treble peak and mid/high emphasis that deviate from strict neutrality, and distortion rises near/under port tuning, requiring sensible bass management. Overall, the design prioritizes efficiency and dynamic capability over state-of-the-art neutrality. [1][2]

## Advice

Use with moderate toe-in to align the horn’s directivity with the listening position, and consider an 60–80 Hz high-pass crossover to minimize port-region distortion and excursion. For buyers prioritizing neutral spin data and smoother directivity, JBL Stage A130 is a technically stronger (but pricier) alternative. If budget cannot exceed ~200 USD and amplifier headroom is limited, R-15M remains attractive for high-efficiency needs; add a subwoofer and appropriate crossover to improve low-frequency performance.
