## Overview

The Klipsch RP-600M II is a 2-way bookshelf speaker released in 2022 as part of the second-generation Reference Premiere series, featuring an enlarged 6.75-inch square conical-tractrix high-frequency horn (18% enlargement from the previous 5.75-inch square) and a 6.5-inch Cerametallic woofer with 70% larger voice coil, incorporating distortion reduction design through Faraday rings and aluminum shorting rings. Offered at 649 USD (pair), it represents an improved product addressing the acoustic challenges of the previous model.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The RP-600M II claims 94.5dB nominal sensitivity, but actual measurements reveal 86dB @2.83V/1m, indicating a significant 8.5dB deviation from published specifications. This represents a major scientific transparency problem in specification presentation. Frequency response characteristics demonstrate more neutral behavior compared to the previous model, with improved noise reduction in the crossover region and smoother high-frequency performance. However, the high-frequency boost beginning around 8kHz remains present, requiring approximately 20-degree outward angle adjustment. Horizontal directivity shows improvement over the previous model but does not achieve transparency level criteria in the measurement results reference table. Scientific validity evaluation reveals problems in both specification misrepresentation and measured performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The RP-600M II incorporates technical improvements including 18% enlarged horn design positioned closer to cabinet edges for reduced turbulence and directivity anomalies, 70% larger voice coil for improved control, speed, and accuracy, distortion reduction through Faraday rings and aluminum shorting rings, and enhanced cabinet reinforcement through additional internal bracing. These improvements effectively address the acoustic challenges of the previous model. However, the fundamental design philosophy represents an evolutionary version of existing Klipsch technologies, with limited revolutionary technical originality from an industry-wide perspective.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The RP-600M II is priced at 113,800 yen (pair) in Japan, with equivalent or superior performing 2-way bookshelf speakers available at significantly lower prices, notably the Yamaha NS-B330 (36,279 yen). The Yamaha NS-B330 features 13cm woofer, 3cm aluminum tweeter, 55Hz-40kHz frequency response, 87dB sensitivity, 40W recommended amplifier output, and high-resolution audio support. Measurement data reveals the RP-600M II's actual sensitivity is 86dB @2.83V/1m (versus claimed 94.5dB), equivalent to the Yamaha NS-B330's 87dB specification. However, the Yamaha NS-B330 provides deeper bass extension (55Hz vs 48Hz) and conventional placement without requiring the 20-degree angle adjustment needed for the RP-600M II. CP = 36,279 yen รท 113,800 yen = 0.32 indicates the Yamaha product achieves superior performance at approximately 3.1 times lower price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Klipsch maintains an extensive history as a US audio company, with the RP-600M II providing standard warranty and support coverage. The furniture-grade MDF cabinet construction with additional internal bracing structure offers improved physical durability compared to the previous model. Practical features include dual input terminals for bi-wiring/bi-amping capability and magnetic attachment grilles. However, horn tweeter characteristics require installation angle adjustment (approximately 20-degree outward angle) to address high-frequency boost around 8kHz, creating convenience limitations for general users.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The RP-600M II design philosophy evolves toward addressing previous model issues, though fundamental problems derived from horn tweeter design persist with severe implications. The most critical issue is the 8.5dB discrepancy between claimed 94.5dB sensitivity and measured 86dB, representing a significant transparency failure in specification presentation. The high-frequency boost above 8kHz and directivity constraints necessitate approximately 20-degree outward angle adjustment, severely restricting conventional stereo installation convenience. Competing designs like the ELAC B6.2 and KEF Q150 achieve superior acoustic performance without such constraints. The rear-port design requirement for wall distance (minimum one foot) adds further installation restrictions. Measurement-based comparisons demonstrate that the Klipsch design philosophy rationality is significantly limited when compared to contemporary acoustic engineering standards.

## Advice

The RP-600M II effectively addresses the acoustic challenges of the previous model and demonstrates cost-performance advantages compared to the approximately twice-priced Monitor Audio Silver 100 7G within the 113,800 yen price range. High-sensitivity design enables adequate volume with low-power amplifiers, providing excellent "punch" and dynamic range response capabilities for rock, electronic, and dynamic music. However, optimal acoustic reproduction requires approximately 20-degree outward angle adjustment, grille usage, and appropriate wall distance maintenance. For home theater applications, high sensitivity and dynamic acoustic characteristics prove advantageous. For requirements demanding deeper low-frequency reproduction, higher power handling, and broader frequency bandwidth, consideration of the Monitor Audio Silver 100 7G with price differential tolerance is recommended.
