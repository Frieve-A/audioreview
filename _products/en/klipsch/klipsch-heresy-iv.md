## Overview

The Klipsch Heresy IV represents the fourth generation of the iconic Heresy design, first introduced in 1957 as a compact center channel speaker. This heritage floorstanding speaker features an all-new K-107-TI titanium diaphragm compression driver, K-702 polyimide compression driver, and K-28-E 12-inch fiber-composite woofer. For the first time in the Heresy lineage, the IV includes a rear port design utilizing Tractrix geometry, improving low-frequency extension by approximately 10Hz compared to its sealed predecessor. Built in Hope, Arkansas using book-matched wood veneer and traditional craftsmanship methods.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Multiple independent measurements reveal significant frequency response deviations that exceed acceptable performance thresholds. Erin's Audio Corner measured on-axis frequency response deviation of +3dB/-4dB above 74Hz [1]. Hi-Fi News laboratory testing found ±4.5dB response error from 200Hz-20kHz, with multiple resonances creating untidy response from 1kHz-20kHz [2]. While What Hi-Fi reported in-room measurements within ±3dB from 70Hz-10kHz [3], this represents borderline problematic performance. All measurement sources confirm the speaker operates at or worse than the ±3dB problematic threshold, with measured sensitivity of 94-95.4dB significantly below the manufacturer's claimed 99dB specification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Heresy IV incorporates updated proprietary driver designs including the new K-107-TI titanium compression driver and Tractrix port geometry. However, the fundamental horn-loaded compression driver approach represents mature analog technology rather than cutting-edge innovation. The design lacks modern digital signal processing, room correction capabilities, or advanced connectivity features common in contemporary speakers. While Klipsch demonstrates in-house engineering capability and maintains proprietary driver development, the technological approach remains rooted in traditional analog acoustic principles without integration of modern computer-aided optimization or active digital processing that characterizes leading-edge speaker technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Current market pricing of 3,198 USD per pair positions the Heresy IV at a significant premium compared to equivalent-or-better alternatives. The Tekton Lore Be achieves superior 98dB sensitivity at 1,760 USD per pair, featuring equivalent floorstanding format and connectivity functions with higher measured efficiency [4]. Equipped with equivalent connectivity and 98dB sensitivity compared to the Heresy IV's measured 94-95.4dB, the Tekton Lore Be represents a clear equivalent-or-better alternative at substantially lower cost. CP = 1,760 ÷ 3,198 = 0.55, rounded to 0.6. The Heresy IV's premium pricing reflects heritage construction and brand positioning rather than superior measured performance, making it a poor cost-performance proposition relative to available alternatives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Klipsch provides exceptional 10-year warranty coverage for Heritage series products, demonstrating manufacturer confidence in long-term durability [5]. The horn-loaded compression driver design features fewer moving parts than complex multi-way dynamic systems, inherently improving reliability. Construction utilizes highest-grade adhesives and fasteners with handcrafted assembly in the dedicated Hope, Arkansas facility, maintaining 75+ years of manufacturing expertise. Global Klipsch support infrastructure and established Heritage product specialization provide comprehensive service coverage. The simple crossover design and robust compression driver technology contribute to expected longevity exceeding typical speaker products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Heritage design philosophy prioritizes maintaining traditional horn sound character and vintage aesthetics over measurement-optimized performance. While the Heresy IV incorporates some improvements including ported enclosure design, fundamental frequency response deviations and horn colorations persist across generations without systematic correction. The approach accepts significant measurement deviations as part of the intended sound signature rather than pursuing transparent, scientifically-validated neutrality. This philosophy contradicts rational audio engineering principles that prioritize achieving measurement-verified transparent reproduction. The emphasis on subjective "heritage sound" over objective performance optimization represents an unscientific approach to loudspeaker design.

## Advice

The Klipsch Heresy IV targets users prioritizing heritage aesthetics and traditional horn sound character over measurement accuracy and cost-performance. Consider this speaker if you specifically value handcrafted heritage construction and the distinctive horn-loaded presentation despite significant frequency response deviations and poor cost-performance. For users seeking high-efficiency operation with better value, the Tekton Lore Be offers superior 98dB sensitivity at 1,760 USD, providing equivalent functionality at 55% of the Heresy IV's cost. The Heresy IV's premium pricing reflects brand positioning rather than superior performance, making it difficult to recommend over more cost-effective alternatives. The 10-year warranty provides excellent long-term security, but cannot justify the significant price premium over equivalent-or-better performing alternatives.
