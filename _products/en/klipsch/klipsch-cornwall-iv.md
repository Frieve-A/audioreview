## Overview

The Klipsch Cornwall IV is a three-way horn-loaded floorstanding loudspeaker in the Heritage series. It employs a K-107-TI titanium HF driver, a K-702 polyimide midrange driver with Tractrix horn, and a 15-inch woofer. Claimed specs include 32 Hz–20 kHz (±4 dB) frequency response, 102 dB sensitivity @2.83V/1m, 119 dB max SPL, and 8-ohm nominal impedance [1]. It is manufactured in Hope, Arkansas with wood veneer finishes (American Walnut, Satin Black Ash, Natural Cherry) [1]. The IV generation updates the network and mid horn (Mumps), maintaining the heritage architecture while refining implementation [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Credible, comprehensive third-party measurements could not be confirmed at this time; thus we rely on manufacturer key specs (32 Hz–20 kHz (±4 dB), 102 dB @2.83V/1m, 119 dB max SPL) [1]. Under our criteria, ±4 dB does not reach transparent level (±0.5 dB). With independent distortion/directivity datasets missing, we set a neutral 0.5 and will revise once robust lab data (e.g., NRC/SoundStage!) is available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Use of proprietary Tractrix horn and Mumps and in-house design are positives [1][2]. The efficiency-oriented horn approach is clear, with accumulated know-how. However, novelty is limited and integration remains analog/mechanical (no DSP/room correction/app features), lacking modern measurement-driven optimization [1]. Overall we set an average 0.5.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Current market price is 7,299 USD per pair [1]. As an equal-function comparator with publicly available independent measurements, we use Polk Audio R700 at 2,199 USD per pair, which shows smooth on-axis response and low distortion in credible third-party testing [3][4]. Calculation: `CP = 2,199 USD ÷ 7,299 USD = 0.301` → round to 0.3. Rationale for equivalence: passive floorstander without DSP; third-party measured performance is equal-or-better [3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Passive design reduces failure points, and Heritage products are covered by a long warranty (10-year indication), a clear plus [6]. Long manufacturing track record and global support also help parts/service availability [6]. As wording and applicability vary by region and category, we assign 0.9 rather than 1.0.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While efficiency gains are scientifically grounded, there is little evidence of modern DSP/room-correction integration or measurement-led functional integration [1]. Costs appear oriented to finish/cabinet rather than measurable performance advances; cross-generation functional integration (auto-optimization, app control) is limited. We judge this conservative.

## Advice

The Cornwall IV fits users who value high-sensitivity passive floorstanders with substantial cabinetry and finish. Low-power amplifier compatibility and long warranty are positives [1][5]. For measurement-focused buyers, alternatives with published independent data (e.g., Polk Audio R700) provide equal-or-better measured performance at far lower cost [3]. Unless the brand/design value is decisive, prioritize cheaper options with confirmed measurements.
