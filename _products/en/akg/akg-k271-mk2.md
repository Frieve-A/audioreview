## Overview

The AKG K271 MkII is a closed-back, over-ear studio headphone positioned for monitoring, mixing, and stage use. It ships with two detachable mini-XLR cables (3 m straight, 5 m coiled) and features an **auto-mute switch in the headband that mutes audio when the headphones are taken off** [1][2]. Official specs list 16 Hz–28 kHz bandwidth, 55 Ω impedance, and 104 dB SPL/V sensitivity (max input 200 mW) with a 30 mm driver [1][2]. While robust and practical, its measured tuning and distortion behavior leave it trailing newer, measurement-optimized studio models.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

- **Manufacturer specs (for context):** 16–28,000 Hz, 55 Ω, 104 dB SPL/V, 200 mW, 30 mm driver [1][2].  
- **Independent measurements:** Reference Audio Analyzer reports **measured sensitivity ≈109.7 dB SPL** and **impedance ≈74.3 Ω**, indicating sample variance vs. catalog values [3]. HeadphoneCheck’s frequency-response plot shows **sub-bass roll-off** (e.g., **25 Hz ≈ −12.5 dB**, **100 Hz ≈ −2.8 dB** relative to their reference), midrange rise (**200–630 Hz ≈ +7 to +9 dB**), and an upper-treble lift (**10 kHz ≈ +5 dB**) [4]. Audio Science Review’s analysis similarly notes **lean bass and bright upper mids/treble**, with reasonable 200 Hz–3 kHz compliance but non-transparent overall balance [5].  
- **Implication:** The FR deviations exceed a typical ±3 dB transparency band across much of the spectrum; bass extension and treble peaks make the K271 MkII less neutral than recent studio competitors.  

Overall, published data support only **moderate** scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Conventional 30 mm dynamic driver, detachable mini-XLR cabling, and the **headband auto-mute** convenience feature [1][2]. No evidence of modern acoustic optimization (e.g., target-matched tuning, advanced magnet structures/diaphragm materials). Solid, time-tested design, but not cutting-edge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Review-target market price (denominator): 130 USD** (current market snapshot) [6].

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **AKG K361** at **79.99 USD** (new, major US retailer) [7].  
*Equivalence note:* Closed-back, over-ear studio monitor with detachable cables; **measured FR RMS deviation ≈2.5 dB and low-frequency extension to 20 Hz** on RTINGS, indicating **equal-or-better neutrality vs. K271 MkII** on core axes relevant to monitoring (FR/extension; THD is also well-controlled) [8].

**CP calculation:** (79.99 USD ÷ 130 USD = 0.615) → **0.6**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Replaceable pads/cables and long market availability are positives. Warranty varies by region (e.g., **Japan offers a 3-year “Y3” dealer warranty** on this model) [9]; typical distributor warranties elsewhere are shorter. The auto-mute’s mechanical switch adds complexity but is a known, serviceable design.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Prioritizes workhorse practicality (auto-mute, serviceable parts) over modern, measurement-driven tuning. Rational for basic studio utility, but not optimized for high-fidelity neutrality by today’s standards.

## Advice

Choose the K271 MkII if you specifically need **headband auto-mute** and a rugged mini-XLR system. If neutrality/value matter more, the **AKG K361** (or K371) provides **closer-to-target FR and better bass extension** at a lower or similar price [8]. For live tracking, K271’s isolation and auto-mute remain useful; for critical mix decisions, competitors with measurement-validated tuning are safer defaults.
