## Overview

The AKG K414P represents a discontinued portable closed-back headphone model from approximately 2008, featuring a 3D-axis folding mechanism for enhanced portability. Originally positioned as an entry-level portable solution, this model utilized dynamic drivers with NdFe magnets and offered basic specifications including reported 12Hz-28kHz frequency response and 32-ohm impedance. However, the product's discontinuation combined with the absence of professional third-party measurement verification significantly limits its relevance in current evidence-based audio evaluation frameworks.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data from credible third-party testing laboratories. No professional measurements are available from established sources such as Audio Science Review, RTINGS, or Crinacle. The reported manufacturer specification for THD (<1%) falls into the problematic range according to headphone criteria (0.5% or above problematic). Key performance indicators including dynamic range, S/N ratio, and sound isolation remain unspecified. Following policy framework for insufficient data, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 representing inability to evaluate due to lack of verified measurement information.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The K414P represents conventional headphone technology from the late 2000s without significant technical innovation beyond the 3D-axis folding mechanism. The design employs standard dynamic drivers with NdFe magnets and analog-only signal path, lacking integration of modern technologies such as digital signal processing, advanced materials, or sophisticated acoustic engineering. No evidence exists of proprietary patent technology adoption or technical differentiation from competitors. The 2008-era technology is now outdated compared to current standards, resulting in limited competitive advantage duration and technological desirability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The K414P was priced at approximately 80 USD when available but is currently discontinued. The cheapest equivalent closed-back headphones with professional design are the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x at 50 USD [1], which provide equivalent closed-back functionality with professional studio monitor design and verified specifications. Premium comparison targets include Sony MDR-7506 (99 USD) [2] and Audio Technica ATH-M40x (97.77 USD) [3], both offering equivalent closed-back functionality with superior measured performance verification [4][5]. The ATH-M20x is equipped with 40mm dynamic drivers and closed-back design, and frequency response (15Hz-20kHz) and professional monitoring capabilities are equivalent-or-better than the K414P's basic portable specifications. CP = 50 USD ÷ 80 USD = 0.6. Given discontinued status and lack of measurement verification compared to readily available alternatives with documented performance, the K414P represents moderate cost-performance value.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The K414P's discontinued status significantly impacts reliability and support evaluation. While the simple closed-back construction with minimal moving parts suggests inherent durability, the absence of ongoing manufacturer support and parts availability affects overall reliability. No current warranty coverage is available, and the support period has ended due to discontinuation. AKG maintains a reasonable reliability track record historically, but this cannot compensate for the lack of active product support and service infrastructure for this discontinued model.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The K414P represents a rational but conservative design approach for its era, focusing on basic portable functionality without technological advancement. The design philosophy emphasized cost-appropriate construction for intended portable applications but lacked commitment to measurement transparency and scientific performance verification. The product's discontinuation without clear successor or technological progression suggests limited investment in evidence-based performance improvement. The conservative approach using conventional technology without innovation or integration of advanced features reflects a design philosophy that prioritizes cost over technological advancement and measured performance optimization.

## Advice

The AKG K414P is not recommended for current purchase consideration due to its discontinued status and lack of measurement verification. Potential users seeking closed-back portable headphones should consider currently available alternatives such as Audio-Technica ATH-M20x [1], Sony MDR-7506 [2] or Audio Technica ATH-M40x [3], which provide equivalent functionality with verified measurement data [4][5] and active manufacturer support. For users requiring evidence-based audio equipment selection, products with professional third-party measurement verification are essential for informed decision-making. The absence of credible performance data makes the K414P unsuitable for applications requiring predictable acoustic performance.
