## Overview

The AKG K361 is a closed-back studio monitoring headphone featuring 50mm dynamic drivers and neutral tonal balance tuned to the Harman curve. At 219 grams, these foldable headphones target professional audio applications with a frequency response of 15Hz-28kHz and 32-ohm impedance (manufacturer specification). Part of AKG's Reference Response series, the K361 aims to provide accurate monitoring capabilities for mixing and editing decisions in studio environments while maintaining affordability in the sub-150 USD market segment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurements from DIY-Audio-Heaven show 34Ω impedance (vs 32Ω manufacturer specification), 99dB efficiency at 1mW, and maximum SPL of 122dB [1]. The K361 demonstrates neutral tonal balance with Harman curve tuning. However, critical distortion metrics including THD and S/N ratio lack credible third-party verification. The 15Hz-28kHz frequency response specification represents adequate but not exceptional range. Sound isolation provides good higher frequency attenuation but limited low frequency dampening. DIY-Audio-Heaven notes "coarse" treble quality lacking "small details" compared to premium models, placing performance between problematic and transparent levels. Conservative evaluation applied due to limited third-party verification of key distortion metrics.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The K361 employs conventional 50mm dynamic drivers with oxygen-free copper voice coils - standard technology without the titanium coating found in higher-end models like the K371 [2]. Construction uses primarily plastic materials with metal reinforcement, representing cost-effective but not innovative implementation. The 2.5mm locking connector provides some differentiation but lacks cutting-edge technology. No proprietary patents, advanced materials, or modern features like digital processing are evident. Technology represents typical mid-market implementation without significant advancement over established dynamic driver designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Equipped with closed-back over-ear design, foldable construction, detachable cables, and professional monitoring tuning, with 50mm drivers and 15Hz-28kHz frequency response. Current market price: 95 USD. Investigation based on third-party measurement data found no products with equivalent-or-better performance at lower prices. While the Superlux HD681 has a wider frequency response range, actual sound quality performance shows high-frequency peaks and distortion issues that do not exceed K361's performance [3]. No equivalent-or-better products exist, therefore CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

AKG provides 1-year warranty coverage through Harman support channels with business-day response times [4]. However, build quality concerns include headband pleather reported to flake after 2-3 years, susceptibility to driver damage from drops, and quality control issues with the folding mechanism based on user discussions [5]. The proprietary 2.5mm connector complicates replacement cable sourcing. Build quality described as "acceptable for asking price" but plastic construction raises long-term reliability questions compared to more robust alternatives.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AKG's Reference Response Acoustics philosophy demonstrates strong scientific foundation through Harman Target Curve research involving 283 listeners across four countries, establishing objective tuning targets over subjective preferences [6]. Design directly targets neutral monitoring accuracy with measurement-focused approach rather than marketing-driven features. The K361 represents rational cost optimization of proven technology while maintaining core performance objectives. However, conservative technology implementation lacks adoption of advanced digital processing, materials science, or modern connectivity options that could enhance functionality.

## Advice

The AKG K361 suits budget-conscious users seeking neutral studio monitoring with established scientific tuning methodology. Best for mixing/mastering applications where accurate tonal balance outweighs absolute technical performance. Consider alternatives like Superlux HD681 for better cost-performance or invest in K371 for improved build quality and extended frequency response. Avoid if long-term durability is priority given reported quality control issues. Suitable for home studios and portable monitoring but verify seal quality for optimal bass response.
