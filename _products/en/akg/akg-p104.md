## Overview

The AKG P104 is a wireless headphone designed specifically for Mercedes-Benz rear seat entertainment systems, developed around 2010 in partnership between AKG, Harman Becker Automotive Systems, and Mercedes-Benz. This product represents an early implementation of automotive wireless audio technology using Kleer RF transmission at 2.4GHz. Originally bundled with Mercedes S-Class and E-Class models, the P104 featured 40mm drivers, supra-aural design with semi-closed acoustical characteristics, and the ability to switch between three audio sources. While innovative for its time period, the product has since been discontinued as the automotive industry moved toward standard Bluetooth implementations.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. Available specifications focus primarily on Kleer wireless technology capabilities rather than acoustic performance of the P104 headphones specifically. While Kleer technology specifications indicate frequency response up to 20kHz and dynamic range exceeding 100dB, critical headphone measurement criteria including frequency response deviation from target curves, total harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, and passive sound isolation performance are not available from credible third-party sources. The 16-bit/44.1kHz lossless transmission capability represents transparent level digital audio quality, but without headphone-specific acoustic measurements, comprehensive evaluation cannot be performed according to established criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The P104's technology level reflects average implementation with both innovative and limiting aspects. Positive factors include adoption of proprietary Kleer RF technology which provided superior performance compared to contemporary Bluetooth and IR solutions, in-house design collaboration between AKG and Harman Becker, and AKG's established audio engineering expertise. However, significant negatives impact the evaluation: Kleer technology has become completely obsolete as of 2025, replaced by superior Bluetooth implementations with aptX Low Latency and other advanced codecs. The proprietary nature that initially provided competitive advantage ultimately became a limitation due to poor industry adoption. The technology offered only short-term competitive advantage before being superseded, and integration remained conventional for 2010 standards without advanced features like software processing or connectivity options.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Cost-performance evaluation reveals poor value compared to modern alternatives. The P104's current market price represents the typical cost for new OEM sets at 100 USD, based on secondary market pricing for complete Mercedes-Benz headphone packages. This price faces direct competition from products offering equivalent-or-better functionality and performance. The selected comparison target, SIMOLIO JH-716B at 39.99 USD, is equipped with aptX Low Latency wireless transmission and sub-40ms latency performance equivalent-or-better to the P104's 25-45ms specification. Additional superior features include 40-hour rechargeable battery life versus AAA battery dependence, universal Bluetooth device compatibility versus Mercedes-specific limitations, and broader codec support with dialogue mode and three EQ presets. CP = 39.99 USD ÷ 100 USD = 0.4.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Reliability and support evaluation reflects mixed performance across factors. Positive aspects include robust physical construction designed to withstand adults accidentally sitting on the device, compliance with multiple regulatory standards including RoHS, ELV, REACH, EC R&TTE, FCC and Industry Canada certification, and AKG's generally reliable brand track record in professional audio equipment. However, significant limitations affect long-term viability: standard 1-year warranty period falls below current industry standards of 2-3 years, discontinued product status severely limits parts availability and repair support, and automotive-specific nature restricts repair options compared to general consumer headphones. The global AKG/Harman support infrastructure provides some coverage, but practical support for this discontinued automotive product remains limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Design philosophy evaluation reveals significant irrationality from current perspective. The choice of proprietary Kleer technology over standard protocols, while innovative in 2010, resulted in poor long-term strategic thinking as the technology rapidly became obsolete. Automotive-specific design provided no clear performance benefits over general-purpose alternatives while severely limiting compatibility and upgrade paths. Cost-effectiveness suffered due to automotive premium pricing without corresponding functional advantages, and performance progression was poor as Kleer technology stagnated while Bluetooth advanced significantly. While the innovative technology adoption was appropriate for 2010 timeframe, the proprietary approach increased costs without meaningful audio performance benefits, and the design failed to anticipate the industry's move toward standardized wireless protocols. The approach fundamentally lacked justification as dedicated automotive equipment when general-purpose solutions could achieve equivalent functionality.

## Advice

The AKG P104 should be considered only for specific Mercedes-Benz compatibility requirements, not as a general-purpose wireless headphone solution. Current owners seeking replacement should migrate to modern Bluetooth headphones offering superior performance, broader device compatibility, and ongoing support. For Mercedes vehicle owners, investigate whether modern Bluetooth headphones work with current rear seat entertainment systems before purchasing proprietary solutions. The proprietary Kleer technology limitations and discontinued status make this product unsuitable for new purchases except in rare cases requiring exact Mercedes compatibility. Modern alternatives like the SIMOLIO JH-716B provide equivalent functionality at significantly lower cost with superior battery life and universal compatibility. Repair support and parts availability remain extremely limited.
