## Overview

The AKG K702 is an open-back reference headphone from Austrian audio manufacturer AKG, a prestigious company founded in 1947 with a long-standing reputation in professional audio. Positioned as the successor to the K701, this model incorporates practical improvements such as a detachable cable system. With its wide frequency response of 10Hz-39.8kHz and 62Ω impedance, it is designed for diverse applications ranging from studio monitoring to audiophile listening. The combination of Varimotion diaphragm and flat-wire voice coil embodies AKG's traditional acoustic design philosophy.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The nominal frequency response of 10Hz-39.8kHz secures transparent-level bandwidth, but specific deviation values are limitedly disclosed. The maximum SPL of 105dB is sufficient for general use but does not reach industry-leading standards. While the open-back design contributes to soundstage expansion and spatial reproduction improvement, quantitative measurement data-based transparency verification remains challenging. The Varimotion diaphragm adoption theoretically provides distortion reduction effects, but insufficient disclosure of detailed THD measurements by third-party institutions limits objective assessment of its effectiveness in the audible range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The combination of Varimotion dual-layer diaphragm and flat-wire voice coil represents meaningful technical improvements over conventional dynamic drivers. The flat-wire structure's inductance reduction has theoretical basis for high-frequency response improvement, showing design rationality. However, these technologies are already mature approaches and lack innovation from current technical standards. The 45mm driver size is standard specification without notable uniqueness. Compared to competitors' latest technologies, it remains within industry average levels with limited technological advantages.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Against the K702's current price of 120 USD, the equivalent-function Philips SHP9500 is available for 107 USD. The SHP9500 offers the same open-back design with 32Ω impedance, 101dB sensitivity, and provides balanced sound characteristics with wide soundstage. Cost-performance calculation yields 107 USD ÷ 120 USD = 0.891, resulting in a 0.9 evaluation. This indicates that equivalent or superior performance can be obtained approximately 11% cheaper, showing limited price advantage. However, the relatively good cost-performance among limited alternatives is commendable.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

AKG, as an established brand founded in 1947, holds a confirmed position in professional audio. The K702 model offers a 2-year warranty, meeting industry standards. The detachable cable adoption improves repairability during cable failures, which is praiseworthy from a practical perspective. However, being currently under Samsung's Harman International subsidiary shows changes in corporate structure compared to the original Austrian headquarters era. Domestic support systems through authorized dealers are established, but overseas product-specific response time limitations exist.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The open-back design specialization for reference applications represents a rational approach toward acoustic transparency pursuit. The 62Ω impedance setting is a practical decision balancing versatility and drivability, based on scientific rationale. The 10Hz-39.8kHz wideband design adequately covers the audible range, aligning with modern acoustic design philosophy that emphasizes objective evaluation through measurement equipment. Flat-wire voice coil adoption is appreciable as a concrete technical approach for high-frequency response improvement. However, the absence of advanced features like digital signal processing or active noise cancellation demonstrates conservative aspects in responding to technological progress.

## Advice

The AKG K702 serves as a suitable choice for users prioritizing reliability in professional audio applications, offering established brand value and stable acoustic performance as a reference headphone. Particularly for engineers and audiophiles familiar with AKG's acoustic characteristics, it delivers expected sound quality. However, for those prioritizing pure cost-performance, consideration should be given to alternatives like the Philips SHP9500, which provides equivalent performance approximately 11% cheaper. Prospective buyers are recommended to carefully balance brand value against price difference and conduct comparative listening in actual usage environments. For those emphasizing long-term reliability and support systems, the 2-year warranty model is worth considering.
