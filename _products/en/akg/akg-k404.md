## Overview

The AKG K404 is a discontinued closed-back, foldable headphone that was positioned in the budget segment of AKG's lineup. Featuring a 3D-axis folding mechanism for portability, the K404 employed dynamic driver technology with specifications including 15-23kHz frequency response, 120dB sensitivity, and 32-ohm impedance. At 75 grams, it offered lightweight construction with a self-adjusting headband and included a carrying pouch. Currently available primarily through secondary markets at approximately 40 USD, the product represents AKG's attempt to deliver portable audio in an affordable package during its production period.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. While manufacturer specifications provide basic information including 15-23kHz frequency response range, 120dB sensitivity, and 32-ohm impedance, critical metrics for audio quality assessment are missing. No third-party measurements are available for THD/THD+N values, signal-to-noise ratio, actual frequency response deviation in ±dB, or sound isolation performance. The frequency response range is listed without deviation tolerance, making performance assessment impossible. According to evaluation framework, when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack sufficient audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Technology level reflects AKG's strong engineering foundation combined with conventional implementation in the K404. The company brings substantial technical credentials including over 1,400 international patents and 60+ years of headphone development experience, particularly in moving coil technology and mass load membrane principles. However, the K404 itself represents standard dynamic driver implementation without notable technical advancement. The 3D-axis folding mechanism provides practical portability benefits but constitutes incremental rather than breakthrough innovation. The product employs appropriate contemporary technology for its era and price point, including closed-back design for passive isolation and standard impedance matching. While lacking cutting-edge features, the implementation demonstrates AKG's technical competence in delivering functional portable audio solutions within budget constraints.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The Tascam TH-02 provides equivalent-or-better functionality at significantly lower cost, establishing the cost-performance baseline. Current AKG K404 market price stands at approximately 40 USD through secondary market availability. The Tascam TH-02 at 23 USD offers equivalent specifications: 50mm dynamic drivers, 18Hz-22kHz frequency response (comparable to K404's 15-23kHz), 32-ohm impedance, closed-back design, and foldable construction for portability. Both products provide essential functionality including passive sound isolation, portable folding mechanisms, and standard impedance matching for consumer devices. Using established cost-performance formula: CP = 23 USD ÷ 40 USD = 0.6. The TH-02's confirmed specifications demonstrate functional equivalence across key performance metrics, with frequency response range meeting standard audio reproduction requirements and impedance matching ensuring compatibility with typical source devices. Foldable design addresses identical portability needs while maintaining closed-back isolation benefits.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Reliability and support present mixed results with documented concerns. AKG provides global manufacturer support infrastructure with dedicated customer service accessible via phone and warranty replacement processes. However, the K404 suffers from below-average warranty coverage at only 1 year compared to industry standard 2-year periods. Multiple user reports indicate cable durability problems specifically at connector points, representing a significant reliability weakness for a portable product designed for frequent folding and transport. The simple dynamic driver design with minimal moving parts theoretically reduces potential failure points, but documented cable issues counteract this advantage. Support availability remains reasonable through AKG's established service network, though the product's discontinued status may impact long-term parts availability and repair support. The combination of shortened warranty period and known durability issues results in average reliability assessment despite adequate support infrastructure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Design philosophy evaluation reflects AKG's generally rational approach with specific product limitations. AKG demonstrates scientific rationality through measurement-focused development practices, earning recognition including a Technical GRAMMY Award for contributions to recording science. The company's extensive patent portfolio in moving coil and membrane technologies indicates consistent technological advancement and innovation commitment. However, the K404 specifically represents conventional implementation without significant differentiation or innovation. The product's discontinued status suggests limited market success and questionable long-term value proposition in AKG's portfolio. While the design avoids excessive meaningless costs common in audio products, it also lacks cost reduction innovation or advanced functional integration. The folding mechanism addresses practical portability needs rationally, but overall execution failed to establish lasting market presence, indicating suboptimal product-market fit despite sound underlying engineering principles.

## Advice

For potential purchasers considering the AKG K404, approach with caution given its discontinued status and documented reliability concerns. The product may appeal to budget-conscious users specifically requiring closed-back, foldable headphones with basic functionality, but superior alternatives exist in the current market. The documented cable durability issues represent a significant concern for a portable product, potentially requiring early replacement or repair. Limited warranty coverage at 1 year provides insufficient protection for long-term use. Current availability through secondary markets at 40 USD pricing may seem attractive, but consider that newer products offer better measurement transparency, improved reliability, and longer support periods. For similar functionality, investigate current-production alternatives from established manufacturers that provide comprehensive specifications, longer warranties, and confirmed reliability records. The K404 may serve as an emergency replacement or temporary solution, but avoid as a primary long-term audio investment given available superior options in the budget segment.
