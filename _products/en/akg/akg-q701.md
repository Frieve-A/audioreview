## Overview

The AKG Q701 "Quincy Jones Signature" represents AKG's premium reference-class headphones featuring patented Varimotion diaphragm technology and flat-wire voice coils. Designed in collaboration with Austrian design firm Kiska, these open-back headphones incorporate genuine leather, metal arches, and 3D-form velvet ear pads. Each unit is individually tested and numbered, emphasizing AKG's commitment to quality control in this signature series.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Multiple measurement sources reveal severe performance issues that critically impact audio fidelity. THD measures 1.4% at 1kHz, significantly exceeding the 0.5% problematic threshold for headphones [1]. Audio Science Review confirms "unacceptably bad distortion peaks in the 1k-3kHz range" at higher listening levels [2]. While the specified frequency range of 10Hz-39.8kHz appears excellent, measured performance shows 19Hz-24.8kHz (±3dB), placing it between problematic and transparent levels [1]. The severe midrange distortion issues, particularly in the critical vocal range, fundamentally compromise the headphone's reference monitoring capability and place it at the significantly exceeds problematic level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Q701 demonstrates substantial technological achievement through proprietary innovations. AKG's patented Varimotion diaphragm varies thickness from 80-micrometer center to 40-micrometer perimeter for optimized frequency response [3]. The company pioneered flat-wire voice coil technology in headphones, providing superior transient response and high-frequency reproduction. With over 1,500 patents since 1947, AKG demonstrates significant intellectual property development. The computer-optimized neodymium magnet system and precision manufacturing processes reflect advanced engineering capabilities that have influenced industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Current market pricing shows the Q701 at approximately 600 USD due to discontinued status [4]. Multiple cheaper alternatives provide equivalent open-back functionality with superior measured performance. The Samson SR850 at 39 USD offers 10Hz-30kHz frequency response, 32Ω impedance, and 50mm dynamic drivers with significantly lower distortion characteristics [5]. The Superlux HD668B at 34 USD provides similar specifications with <0.3% THD at 1kHz/1V, substantially better than the Q701's 1.4% [6]. Both deliver equivalent-or-better user functions with vastly superior cost-performance. Using the cheapest equivalent alternative: CP = 34 USD ÷ 600 USD = 0.06, rounded to 0.1.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

AKG provides 1-2 year warranty coverage through Harman's global support infrastructure with dedicated customer service lines [7]. Construction features robust metal arches, genuine leather components, and detachable cables supporting longevity. However, discontinued production status limits long-term parts availability and repair support. The simple dynamic driver design with minimal moving components supports inherent reliability, while AKG's established track record provides confidence in build quality standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Q701 represents pre-Harman Target era design philosophy, prioritizing traditional audiophile preferences over scientific measurement targets. Investment in Varimotion and flat-wire technologies demonstrates rational pursuit of performance improvements through innovative engineering approaches. The sophisticated driver technology and precision manufacturing reflect serious engineering commitment to audio quality. While the resulting midrange distortion issues indicate limitations in execution, the underlying design philosophy of pursuing advanced driver technologies shows scientific rationality. Modern AKG products like the K371 series demonstrate evolution toward Harman Target compliance, building upon the Q701's technological foundations with improved measurement-focused approach.

## Advice

The Q701's severe midrange distortion issues make it unsuitable for critical listening or professional monitoring despite its advanced driver technology. Current pricing due to discontinued status creates extremely poor value proposition compared to alternatives like the Samson SR850 (39 USD) or Superlux HD668B (34 USD), both offering superior measured performance at fraction of the cost. Those seeking open-back reference headphones should consider these budget alternatives or current generation products that incorporate modern scientific tuning approaches while avoiding the Q701's distortion issues.
