## Overview

The AKG K712 pro is an open-back reference headphone developed by AKG, the veteran Austrian audio manufacturer. It features 105dB SPL/V sensitivity, 62Ω impedance, 10-39,800Hz frequency response, and achieves a lightweight design at 235g. It adopts detachable cables and replaceable ear pads, designed for professional mixing and mastering applications. AKG is an acoustic equipment manufacturer founded in 1947 with proven track record in microphones and headphones.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The K712 pro achieves very flat frequency response characteristics, with measurement data showing extremely flat 100-1000Hz range compared to other headphones. High-frequency extension is excellent, and bass reproduction has improved compared to K701 and K702. The open-back design enables accurate soundstage reproduction with measurable effects for mixing and mastering applications. However, performance doesn't significantly exceed auditory transparency levels, limiting practical improvement effects.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

It adopts large drivers using Varimotion technology, but fundamentally represents an improved version of conventional technology. Mechanical design including self-adjusting headband and replaceable ear pads is practical but not innovative technology. Open-back acoustic design follows industry-standard approaches with limited technical uniqueness. Detachable cable adoption is practical but a common feature.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against the current price of ¥34,800, affordable open-back headphones like the Philips SHP9500 (approximately ¥10,000) exist. The SHP9500 features a 50mm dynamic driver with open-back characteristics, offering limited practical audio quality differences. CP = 10,000 ÷ 34,800 = 0.29, presenting price competitiveness challenges. While valuable for professional applications requiring fine audio quality differences, it's overpriced for general use.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AKG has over 75 years of track record as a veteran manufacturer, with product reliability at a high level. A 2-year warranty is provided by domestic authorized dealers, with consumables like ear pads readily available. Long-term usage track record in professional studios proves durability. However, considering the price range, it's not entirely satisfactory.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy targeting flat frequency response for reference applications is highly rational. Open-back acoustic design achieves accurate soundstage reproduction while balancing weight reduction and comfort. Adoption of detachable cables and replaceable ear pads shows consideration for long-term use. While high costs due to audio-dedicated design pose challenges, the necessity for professional applications is understandable. Overall, very rational design.

## Advice

While the AKG K712 pro certainly achieves flat and accurate sound quality, it faces price competitiveness challenges. Considering the reality that the SHP9500 provides practical open-back sound at approximately 1/3 the price, purchase reasons require consideration. It becomes an option for professional mixing and mastering applications where fine audio quality differences matter, but for general DTM and music listening, affordable alternatives often suffice. If budget allows and you have attachment to the AKG brand, it's a highly satisfying product.

## Additional Information

Included accessories comprise a 3m detachable cable and replacement ear pads. The lightweight 235g design ensures comfort during extended use. Being open-back, sound leakage occurs requiring consideration for surroundings.
