## Overview

AKG N90Q Reference Class Auto-Calibrating Noise Cancelling Headphones represented AKG's flagship model developed in collaboration with Grammy-winning producer Quincy Jones. Released in 2015 with an original MSRP of 1500 USD, these headphones introduced TruNote technology, the world's first auto-calibration system that measures individual ear anatomy to create personalized frequency response correction filters. The N90Q combined active noise cancellation, built-in DAC with USB digital audio support, comprehensive tone and stage controls, and premium materials including aluminum construction and leather cushions. The product has been discontinued from official channels since approximately 2020 and is now available only through secondary markets at significantly reduced prices (typically 300-350 USD used). This evaluation reflects the product's capabilities within the context of both its original 2015 release and current secondary market availability.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Available third-party measurements from Stereophile reveal significant frequency response deviations that impact audio fidelity. The raw frequency response shows a notable dip between 4-6kHz followed by a rise to 10kHz, with the top octave averaging 3dB too hot according to measurement criteria [1]. While TruNote calibration provides meaningful improvement in response matching between ears, the underlying frequency response still exhibits problematic deviations from neutral. Passive isolation measures -27dB broadband, which falls between problematic (10dB) and excellent (30dB) levels. Critical audio quality measurements including THD, S/N ratio, and specific ANC performance data are unavailable from credible third-party sources. Given the frequency response issues confirmed by independent measurements, a conservative evaluation approach is applied.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The N90Q incorporates several advanced technologies for its 2015 release timeframe. TruNote auto-calibration technology uses dual microphones in each ear cup to measure frequency response and generate correction filters within one second, representing genuine innovation in personalized audio. All analog inputs pass through a 24bit/96kHz ADC feeding a digital signal processing engine that handles tone control, stage control, and TruNote functions. The built-in DAC supports USB digital audio at 16/24-bit depths and 44.1/48/96kHz sample rates. However, from a 2025 perspective, the technology has become dated with similar auto-calibration features now available in competing products. While the technical implementation demonstrates solid engineering expertise, the competitive advantage has diminished and newer approaches have emerged.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Based on current secondary market pricing of approximately 325 USD for used units in good condition, market analysis reveals that no currently available over-ear headphones offer equivalent auto-calibration functionality at lower prices. The OLLO Audio X1 at 539 USD provides similar individual calibration technology but at significantly higher cost. While the Denon PerL earbuds at 199 USD offer auto-calibration through Masimo Adaptive Acoustic Technology, they represent a different form factor (in-ear vs over-ear) and cannot be considered equivalent for users specifically seeking over-ear headphones. Contemporary alternatives including Sony WH-1000XM5 at 399 USD and Bose QuietComfort Ultra at 429 USD lack equivalent auto-calibration technology despite their higher prices. As the cheapest available option with auto-calibration in over-ear form factor, the N90Q achieves maximum cost-performance for this specific functionality combination. CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Multiple design vulnerabilities and user-reported issues significantly impact reliability assessment. The 2.5mm analog connector at the ear capsule is documented as excessively vulnerable to damage, with user reports of the connector breaking under normal use [2]. A critical design flaw prevents any operation once the battery depletes, with no battery level indicator to warn users. Harman has officially confirmed that the battery cannot be replaced and internal parts are not available for sale. User reports document technical problems including clicking sounds and defective units requiring replacement. The complex electronics with DSP, DAC, and calibration systems represent multiple potential failure points. As a discontinued product, manufacturer support is no longer available and replacement parts are unavailable through official channels. The combination of inherent design vulnerabilities, documented failure modes, discontinued status, and irreplaceable battery creates significant long-term reliability concerns for secondary market purchasers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

AKG's development approach demonstrates scientific rationality through measurement-based TruNote calibration technology and collaboration with industry professionals. The auto-calibration system represents genuine innovation addressing individual anatomical variations in hearing. Advanced DSP integration and digital processing show appropriate adoption of modern technology for audio improvement. However, the high price point relative to measurable performance benefits raises cost-effectiveness questions. Premium materials including aluminum and leather construction contribute to cost without clear acoustic advantages. While the scientific approach to personalized sound through measurement is commendable, the overall value proposition and cost optimization could be improved. The design philosophy balances innovation with practical concerns but falls short of ideal cost-to-benefit optimization.

## Advice

At current secondary market pricing around 325 USD, the AKG N90Q presents a significantly improved value proposition compared to its original 1500 USD MSRP. As the most affordable option for auto-calibration technology in over-ear headphones, it offers unique value despite the risks associated with discontinued products. However, potential buyers must weigh significant reliability risks including vulnerable 2.5mm connector design, irreplaceable battery, complete battery dependency, and lack of manufacturer support due to discontinued status. Secondary market purchases carry additional risks regarding battery condition and overall unit functionality. Users seeking reliable auto-calibration technology should consider the OLLO Audio X1 at 539 USD for new product warranty and support, though at significantly higher cost. The N90Q may appeal to enthusiasts willing to accept reliability risks for its unique feature combination at reduced secondary market pricing, but buyers should factor potential repair costs and limited component availability into their decision.
