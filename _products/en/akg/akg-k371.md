## Overview

The AKG K371 are over-ear, closed-back, foldable studio headphones released in December 2019. Developed using Harman's scientifically-validated Target Curve research led by Dr. Sean Olive, these headphones represent AKG's commitment to measurement-based acoustic engineering. Featuring 50mm titanium-coated drivers with pure oxygen-free copper voice coils, the K371 delivers professional monitoring capabilities with exceptional frequency response accuracy. The design includes an 8-position articulated hinge for portability and three detachable cables via mini-XLR connection.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Multiple independent measurements confirm the K371's superior acoustic performance. RTINGS measurements show frequency response following the 2018 Harman Target Curve within +3/-2dB below 2kHz, meeting transparent level criteria [1]. THD performance measures 0.08% at 94dB SPL, approaching transparent levels for headphones, though reaching 0.21% at 104dB SPL [1]. Impedance variation remains exceptionally controlled at 35.0-40.0 ohms across 20Hz-20kHz [2]. The 118.3dB/V sensitivity provides excellent efficiency above average levels [1]. These measurements demonstrate measurably superior frequency response accuracy compared to most competitors, with very good THD performance at normal listening levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The K371 incorporates AKG's Reference Response acoustic target based on extensive Harman research involving hundreds of listeners and blind testing protocols. This scientifically-validated approach represents contemporary psychoacoustic engineering rather than traditional subjective tuning methods. The implementation utilizes 50mm titanium-coated drivers with pure OFC voice coils, representing solid conventional dynamic driver technology. The mini-XLR connector system provides secure cable attachment superior to standard 3.5mm connections. However, the design relies purely on analog/mechanical implementation without digital integration or cutting-edge driver technologies seen in premium offerings.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AKG K361 provides equivalent professional monitoring performance at significantly lower cost. Equipped with identical 50mm drivers and professional monitoring functions, the K361 delivers frequency response and THD performance that are equivalent-or-better than the K371, with many reviewers preferring its more neutral midrange tuning [3]. Current market pricing: K371 at 155 USD versus K361 available at 95 USD [4]. CP calculation: 95 USD รท 155 USD = 0.613, resulting in a cost-performance score of 0.6. The K361 alternative demonstrates that equivalent professional monitoring capabilities are available at significantly lower cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

AKG provides a standard 1-year warranty through authorized dealers, below the industry average of 2 years [5]. Multiple user reports document significant build quality issues including loose hinges, channel imbalances, and premature mechanical failures [6]. Community discussions frequently mention units "falling apart after a year even with gentle treatment" and problems with headband connection mechanisms [6]. The coiled cable exhibits high microphonics, and earpad degradation is commonly reported [6]. While AKG maintains standard warranty support infrastructure, the documented failure patterns significantly impact long-term reliability expectations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

AKG's adoption of the scientifically-validated Harman Target Curve represents exemplary rational design philosophy. The development process involved extensive psychoacoustic research, blind testing with hundreds of listeners worldwide, and resulted in measurably superior frequency response accuracy [7]. This approach directly prioritizes scientific validation over traditional audiophile mythology or subjective preferences. The design philosophy recognizes that "tuning headphones to be absolutely neutral presents a problem: they just don't sound right to listeners" and addresses this through research-based acoustic targets [7]. The K371 represents clear advancement over previous AKG models in measurement performance, demonstrating commitment to continuous scientific improvement.

## Advice

The AKG K371 offers exceptional acoustic engineering based on scientific research, making it suitable for users prioritizing measurement-validated frequency response accuracy. However, significant reliability concerns and the availability of the more cost-effective K361 alternative should influence purchasing decisions. For professional monitoring applications where ultimate accuracy justifies the premium, the K371 delivers measurably superior performance. Budget-conscious users should strongly consider the K361, which provides equivalent monitoring capabilities at half the price. Users choosing the K371 should factor potential replacement costs due to documented build quality issues and consider purchasing extended warranty coverage.
