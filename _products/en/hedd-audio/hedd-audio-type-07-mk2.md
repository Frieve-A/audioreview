## Overview

The HEDD Audio Type 07 MK2 is a 2-way active studio monitor designed for professional and home studio environments, featuring a 7-inch woofer paired with HEDD's signature hand-built Air Motion Transformer (AMT) tweeter. Founded in 2015 by Klaus Heinz (former ADAM Audio founder) and his son Frederik Knop, HEDD Audio continues the legacy of AMT technology refinement established over decades of experience. The Type 07 MK2 incorporates 32-bit SHARC DSP processing, comprehensive connectivity including both analog XLR and digital AES/EBU inputs with pass-through, and advanced user tuning capabilities. Manufactured in Berlin with each unit individually tested, the monitor represents HEDD's commitment to precision audio reproduction through scientific measurement-based development approaches. The product is sold as individual single units, with US market pricing at 1,690 USD per pair.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient numerical measurement data from credible third-party sources. While official specifications include frequency range (38 Hz - 40 kHz), maximum SPL (116 dB per pair at 1m), and technical capabilities (96 kHz/32-bit AD/DA conversion, 200W total amplification), critical performance metrics such as frequency response deviation, THD, SNR, IMD, and crosstalk measurements are not available from independent measurement laboratories. Sound on Sound mentions "relatively flat on-axis response" and "mild high-frequency roll-off off-axis," but provides no quantifiable data to assess actual deviation from ideal response [1]. According to evaluation framework guidelines, when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack specific audio-quality-relevant numerical data, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 pending independent verification of actual performance characteristics.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Type 07 MK2 demonstrates exceptional technical sophistication through HEDD's proprietary refinements to Air Motion Transformer technology, building upon Klaus Heinz's decades of accumulated expertise from ADAM Audio development. The monitor incorporates patent-pending Variable Velocity Technology (VVT) advancements to AMT design [2], representing meaningful innovation beyond expired original Oskar Heil patents. Advanced 32-bit SHARC DSP processing enables comprehensive user tuning capabilities including HEDD Lineariser® with zero-phase filtering, closed/ported functionality switching, desktop/shelf filters, and Hi/Low shelving EQ adjustments. The technology integration combines analog driver excellence with cutting-edge digital signal processing, 96 kHz/32-bit conversion, and ICEpower Class D amplification. AMT technology remains highly desirable across the industry, with HEDD's refinements representing continued innovation in a field where competitive advantage requires years to replicate. The comprehensive DSP implementation provides practical benefits unavailable in passive monitor designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The HEDD Type 07 MK2 is priced at 1,690 USD per pair according to current US market pricing. No cheaper equivalent exists that provides the combination of AES/EBU digital input with pass-through capability, advanced 32-bit SHARC DSP processing, and comprehensive user tuning functions. When evaluating products with equivalent functionality, the Dynaudio Core 7 at 4,200 USD per pair represents the next available option providing comparable AES/EBU digital connectivity with pass-through and advanced DSP capabilities [7]. While budget alternatives such as ADAM Audio T7V at 500 USD per pair provide analog XLR connectivity and basic DSP processing [3], they lack the AES/EBU digital input capability that enables direct integration into professional digital audio workflows without additional conversion stages. The AES/EBU connectivity provides users with maintained signal integrity throughout the monitoring chain, elimination of analog conversion artifacts, and simplified studio routing in fully digital environments. The Type 07 MK2 therefore represents the most cost-effective option for users requiring professional digital connectivity combined with advanced DSP functionality in a 7-inch active monitor format.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

HEDD demonstrates strong commitment to product longevity through industry-leading 5-year warranty coverage when registered within 6 months of purchase, significantly exceeding typical 2-year industry standard [5]. The company experienced a known DSP board issue affecting some Type 20 and Type 07 monitors produced before September 2022, involving an off-spec component causing speakers to malfunction after approximately one year of use [6]. HEDD proactively acknowledged the problem, identified the root cause, and implemented corrective measures, advising affected customers to contact support for resolution. Units purchased after September 2022 should not experience this issue. The DSP-based design enables firmware update capabilities for ongoing support enhancement. Klaus Heinz's established track record from ADAM Audio experience, combined with HEDD's commitment to fully serviceable components and Berlin-based manufacturing quality control, contributes to overall reliability confidence despite the early production challenges.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

HEDD's design philosophy demonstrates exceptional scientific rationality through measurement-focused development approaches and evidence-based performance optimization. The company's emphasis on transparent sound reproduction through advanced DSP implementation, high-resolution digital conversion, and refined AMT technology represents rational investment in audibly meaningful improvements. Cost allocation directly supports functional performance through sophisticated digital signal processing capabilities, proprietary AMT refinements, and comprehensive user tuning options rather than luxury materials or marketing-driven specifications. The integration of modern digital technologies (32-bit SHARC DSP, 96 kHz conversion, software-based room correction) with proven analog driver technology exemplifies optimal technology adoption for practical user benefits. HEDD's approach eliminates subjective audio mythology in favor of scientific measurement principles, while the comprehensive serviceability commitment and extended warranty demonstrate confidence in engineering quality. The design philosophy effectively combines innovation with proven scientific principles to achieve measurable performance improvements.

## Advice

For users requiring professional-grade studio monitors with comprehensive digital connectivity and advanced DSP capabilities, the HEDD Type 07 MK2 provides exceptional value through its unique combination of AMT technology refinements and extensive functionality. The AES/EBU digital input with pass-through capability makes it particularly suitable for digital audio workflows where maintaining signal integrity throughout the monitoring chain is essential. Potential purchasers should consider the larger room requirements appropriate for 7-inch monitors compared to smaller alternatives. At 1,690 USD per pair, the Type 07 MK2 represents significant investment for stereo monitoring, but offers unique functionality unavailable at lower price points. The 5-year warranty coverage provides excellent long-term value protection when properly registered. Users focused solely on basic analog monitoring may find comparable performance at lower cost through alternatives lacking digital connectivity, though the DSP-based room correction capabilities provide significant practical advantages across varied acoustic environments. The resolved DSP board issues in post-2022 production ensure current reliability expectations align with HEDD's warranty commitments.
