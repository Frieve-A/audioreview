## Overview

The Telefunken ELA M 251E is a large-diaphragm tube condenser microphone that recreates the 1960–1965 classic with modern manufacturing. It uses an in-house CK12-style capsule, Haufe T14/1 transformer, and a 6072A tube, offering cardioid, omni, and figure-8 patterns. Official specs list 20 Hz–20 kHz (±3 dB), sensitivity 17 mV/Pa, THD <0.2% at 1 kHz/1 Pa, S/N 85 dBA, self-noise 9 dBA, and max SPL 130 dB (for 1% THD) [1]. Sweetwater cites an estimated original run of fewer than 3,700 units for the vintage model and shows a current market price of 11,995 USD [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

From a transparency standpoint, the ELA M 251E sits on the problematic border: on-axis response is specified only as 20 Hz–20 kHz (±3 dB), which is exactly at our “problem-threshold” band. Max SPL is 130 dB (1% THD), THD is <0.2% at 1 Pa, and S/N is 85 dBA with self-noise 9 dBA (manufacturer specs) [1]. These figures imply higher distortion and lower linearity than modern solid-state studio condensers that achieve flatter FR and lower noise. Comprehensive third-party bench measurements were not found; therefore, this section relies on official specifications and is provisional pending independent lab data [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The engineering execution is meticulous: in-house edge-terminated CK12-style capsule, Haufe T14/1 transformer, and carefully selected 6072A tube [1]. However, the design intent is replication rather than advancement and integrates no novel acoustical or DSP innovations relative to current possibilities. Strong craftsmanship but a conservative technology direction keeps the score slightly above average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

At **11,995 USD** (market) [3], the 251E faces a far cheaper **AKG C414 XLS** that is **equivalent-or-better** for user-visible functions and key measured performance: nine polar patterns (vs 3), frequency range 20 Hz–20 kHz, **self-noise 6 dB-A**, S/N 88 dB-A, and **max SPL 140–158 dB with pads** (IEC 60268-4) [4]. The C414 XLS street price is **1,199 USD** at a major US retailer [5].  
Calculation: **1,199 ÷ 11,995 = 0.10** → CP rounded to **0.1**.  
Conclusion: the 251E commands a massive premium for vintage voicing and build rather than measurable performance gains.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Telefunken provides a **90-day** warranty for capsule/tube and **one-year** parts/labor for amplifier and power supply [2]. Mechanical build is robust, but tubes are consumables and add maintenance risk/cost over time. Support infrastructure is established, yet warranty terms are average for pro audio; hence a mid-score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The product philosophy prioritizes heritage color over scientific transparency. Cost is concentrated in recreating historical parts (tube, transformer, capsule) rather than improving objective metrics like FR linearity or noise. Relative to modern transparent microphones, this is a conservative and non-advancing direction [1][4].

## Advice

Choose the ELA M 251E only if you specifically need its classic tube character and are comfortable paying for craftsmanship and brand heritage. For transparent, versatile studio capture at a fraction of the price, the **AKG C414 XLS** delivers broader pattern options and superior noise/SPL performance [4][5]. If you prefer a modern industry standard with strong measured performance and multi-pattern capability, the **Neumann U 87 Ai** remains a common studio reference [6], though it is still far cheaper than the 251E.
