## Overview

The FM255 MkIIR is an upper-tier line stage from FM Acoustics’ Resolution Series. It offers true-balanced I/O, switchable true-impedance attenuators, and a Swiss-made remote with fast/slow volume steps. Production has ended; the FM 256-RC carries the line forward, and FM states the 255 series served as a mainstay for nearly three decades[1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are no credible third-party measurements (THD+N, S/N, crosstalk, etc.) publicly available. The manufacturer claims high interference rejection (~100 dB at inputs), robust cable drive, and true-balanced outputs, but these do not substitute for independent audibility-relevant data[1][3]. Per policy, with unknown measured transparency we set the baseline at 0.5 pending independently verified results.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Engineering highlights include fully discrete “enhanced Class A” circuits, true-impedance input attenuators, true-balanced I/O with automatic optimization to various loads, and a dual-speed remote volume control. Swiss hermetically sealed relays rated for high switching cycles are used across the series materials[1][3]. However, absent modern third-party bench data, we refrain from awarding a higher score typical of state-of-the-art measured designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Comparator (equal-or-better):** Benchmark **LA4**—balanced/unbalanced I/O, remote, and proven transparency with extremely low distortion and very high S/N (105.5 dB in-band; 108.7 dB A-weighted)[4]. **Price:** 2,599 **USD** (remote included)[5].  
**Subject unit market price (current used):** FM255 MkII series at **15,900 EUR** (audio-markt, 2024-05-19). **ECB** rate **1 EUR = 1.1606 USD** (2025-08-12) → **18,453.54 USD**[7][8].  
**Formula:** 2,599 **USD** ÷ 18,453.54 **USD** = **0.1409…** → round to **0.1**.  
**Equivalence note:** LA4 offers the same user-facing functions (line-level preamp with balanced/unbalanced I/O and remote) and objectively superior/transparent measured performance (S/N, THD+N, channel separation)[4][5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The FM255 MkIIR is discontinued and support centers on the FM 256-RC[2]. FM Acoustics maintains service and emphasizes modular construction, but service access is via a limited distributor network and long-term parts availability is less certain than for current mass-market models[1][6].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Discrete Class-A topology, careful grounding/shielding, and interference rejection are rational means. Yet, without verifiable transparency-level bench results, claims remain difficult to validate against modern, measurement-driven designs[1][3][4]. We therefore assign a moderate score.

## Advice

If you value FM Acoustics’ build style and ergonomics (true-balanced paths, fast/slow volume), the FM255 MkIIR remains desirable. However, given present market pricing (~18,454 USD) against a transparent, fully measured alternative like the LA4 at 2,599 USD, value is weak[4][5][7][8]. If you prefer FM’s approach and want room-mode control, consider the current FM 256-RC with analogue ARC; otherwise, prioritize measurement-centric preamps for best price-to-performance[2][4].
