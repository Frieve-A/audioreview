summary: "Budget USB-C desktop speakers with basic catalog specs (8W RMS, 100–17,000 Hz FR, 75 dB SNR) and no third-party measurements; technically simple but rational for convenience; no cheaper product found with equal-or-better published power and SNR, so CP=1.0."

## Overview

The Creative Pebble V2 is a compact 2.0 USB-powered desktop speaker set with USB-C power input (Type-A adapter included), 2-inch full-range drivers angled at 45°, and passive radiators. Creative lists total output up to 8W RMS (16W peak), frequency response 100–17,000 Hz (no tolerance stated), and SNR 75 dB [1][2][3]. As of August 20, 2025, the Creative US store lists the price at 32.99 USD (denominator rounded to 33 USD in this review) [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

There are no credible third-party lab measurements (FR magnitude with tolerance, THD, max SPL) publicly available for Pebble V2. Manufacturer specifications indicate 100–17,000 Hz frequency response (tolerance not specified), SNR 75 dB, and total 8W RMS output [1][2][3]. For speakers, SNR of ~75 dB is below the “sufficient” ~80 dB guideline, and the FR ceiling at 17 kHz suggests limited extension; without tolerance, audibility cannot be established. Starting from the 0.5 baseline for unknown measurements, we adjust down to 0.3 reflecting these catalog constraints while awaiting independent data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design uses commodity 2″ full-range drivers with passive radiators, USB bus-power, and an angled baffle. No advanced DSP, novel transducers, or publicly documented proprietary acoustic innovations are presented. The approach is competent but conventional for this category [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Market price (review target):** 33 USD (Creative US store) [1].  
We surveyed cheaper 2.0 desktop alternatives and found none that **simultaneously** meet or exceed Pebble V2’s **published** user-facing metrics (≥8W RMS **and** SNR ≥75 dB) at a lower price:

- Logitech Z150: 3W RMS (insufficient power), SNR not specified [4].  
- Edifier R19U: 2W×2 RMS (4W total) and SNR ≥80 dB (power insufficient) [5].

Given no cheaper equivalent-or-better option based on available official specifications, the score is clamped to **CP = 1.0** (no formula display per rule).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Creative provides a standard limited hardware warranty of **12 months** for retail products and a typical online RMA process [6]. No broader field failure-rate data are published. For a simple active speaker without firmware, this aligns with an industry-average stance.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product’s goals—USB bus-power, small footprint, and 45° upward firing toward ear height—are practical and scientifically reasonable for desktop use. However, the absence of disclosed third-party measurements or tighter tolerance specs means the design direction does not clearly target transparent-level performance; overall the philosophy is neutral to modestly rational [1][2].

## Advice

If you need basic, space-saving speakers powered over USB and want to avoid wall power, Pebble V2 is straightforward and inexpensive. For critical listening or known transparent performance, prefer speakers with published third-party FR/THD and max-SPL data. If bass extension or level is a priority, consider a 2.1 set (e.g., Pebble Plus) or small powered monitors; if you only need casual audio at a desk, Pebble V2 can suffice while keeping wiring simple.
