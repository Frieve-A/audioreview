## Overview

The Creative T60 is a compact 2.0 desktop speaker system featuring 30W RMS power through dual 2.75-inch full-range drivers. Marketed with Sound Blaster processing (Clear Dialog / Surround), it offers multiple connectivity options including **USB-C digital audio**, **Bluetooth 5.0**, and **3.5 mm** analog input, plus integrated **headset/mic passthrough**. While convenient for space-constrained desks and WFH setups, its audio performance is modest for music-first listening.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

We could not verify any **independent, reproducible full-band lab measurements** (e.g., anechoic FR/THD) for T60. In such cases, we start from a neutral baseline and ground the assessment in **official specifications** and design constraints:

- **Drivers / topology:** dual **2.75"** full-range in a 2.0 configuration with BasXPort and built-in amp.  
- **Claimed frequency response:** **50 Hz–20 kHz** (manufacturer spec).  
- **I/O and processing:** **USB-C** digital audio, **Bluetooth 5.0**, 3.5 mm line-in, headset/mic passthrough; vendor DSP (Clear Dialog / Surround).

Given the lack of third-party measurements, **Scientific Validity = 0.5** (baseline).

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The T60 combines standard components and vendor DSP. Clear Dialog and Surround are software features that improve intelligibility and spatial impression but are not fundamental hardware advances. The 2.75" full-range drivers, compact cab design, and integrated amplifier are conventional; USB-C/BT connectivity and SmartComms conveniences are competent but typical. Overall technical distinctiveness is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A compliant comparator must be **equal or better in functions**—notably **USB digital audio + Bluetooth**—and not worse in measured performance. Among broadly available options, **Logitech Z407** satisfies the functional criteria (**micro-USB** digital audio and **Bluetooth** with a subwoofer). The official store lists Z407 at **129.99 USD**, while T60’s typical street price is about **90 USD**. T60 therefore remains the **lower-cost** USB-audio/Bluetooth option, supporting **Cost-Performance = 0.3**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Simple 2.0 architecture with few moving parts suggests reasonable reliability. Creative provides standard regional warranty and support channels; exact terms vary by market. The all-plastic exterior benefits from careful handling.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For a compact, desk-centric speaker, prioritizing **USB-C**, **Bluetooth**, and **headset passthrough** is a coherent choice. **BasXPort** and vendor DSP are common engineering methods to extend usability within the limits of dual 2.75" drivers. We deduct for heavy DSP reliance and limited user-tunable controls, but the overall philosophy remains **functional and target-appropriate**, not pseudo-technical.

## Advice

Choose the Creative T60 if you value **small footprint and flexible connectivity** (USB-C audio, Bluetooth, headset passthrough) over absolute fidelity. For stronger low-frequency output and room-filling sound within a similarly convenient package, consider a **2.1** alternative like **Logitech Z407**; if you mainly need small desktop speakers for calls and casual listening, the T60’s convenience remains attractive.
