## Overview

The Creative Stage Air V2 is a compact under-monitor soundbar designed for desktop use with versatile connectivity options. Measuring 410 x 94 x 75 mm and featuring a built-in 2200mAh battery for up to 6 hours of wireless operation, it targets users seeking convenience and portability. The soundbar features dual custom-tuned full-range drivers with an oversized passive radiator, delivering 2 x 5W continuous output with 20W peak power. Connectivity includes Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C digital audio, and 3.5mm auxiliary input, making it compatible with computers, gaming consoles, and mobile devices.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Available specifications and consistent third-party listening impressions point to clear performance limits. Frequency response is rated at **80 Hz–20 kHz**, implying missing sub-bass compared with fuller-range desktop speakers. **SNR ≥ 75 dB** is modest for active PC speakers, and Bluetooth supports **SBC only**. Independent reviews repeatedly describe a **harsh/metallic treble** and **worsening sound at higher volumes**, including notes of congestion and roughness. In the absence of comprehensive independent measurements (e.g., full FR/THD sweeps), this score is derived from manufacturer specs plus concordant subjective reports of problems. [1][2][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Stage Air V2 employs industry-standard implementation with modest custom elements. Custom-tuned full-range drivers and an oversized passive radiator reflect basic in-house engineering; Bluetooth 5.3 and USB-C are contemporary but not cutting edge. The integrated battery is practical but mature technology with no material innovation barriers. Overall, the approach is readily reproducible and lacks distinctive proprietary processing.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Cost-performance is evaluated against the **cheapest equivalent-or-better** alternative by functions and basic performance. **Monoprice SB-100** (official product page) offers equivalent connectivity (**Bluetooth / 3.5mm / optical**) and materially higher rated output (**80W**) via built-in subwoofer drivers. Current general sale prices as of **Sep 3, 2025**: **Stage Air V2 59.99 USD** (widely available retail), **SB-100 69.99 USD** (official store).  
**CP = 59.99 ÷ 69.99 ≈ 0.86.**  
While the Stage Air V2’s battery and compact under-monitor form are convenient, these are not core audio performance advantages and do not close the performance gap for pure CP evaluation. [6][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Creative provides above-average support infrastructure with **12-month** limited warranty (**24 months in EU**) covering defects under normal use. Build quality receives positive assessments (“solidly built”) despite primarily plastic construction. The rechargeable battery is the main potential failure point in an otherwise simple design. Creative’s long audio history and documentation contribute to above-average reliability expectations for the price category. [3][4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Creative articulates a practical, accessibility-focused philosophy which translates to multi-input flexibility, portable operation, and a desktop-friendly form. Marketing avoids pseudo-scientific claims, instead emphasizing tangible features and usability. [5]

## Advice

Choose the Stage Air V2 if portability, under-monitor space savings, and quick multi-device hookup matter more than fidelity. If **desktop sound quality** is your priority and you do not need battery operation, consider **Creative Stage SE**: it targets desktop use with higher on-paper capability (**FR 55–20 kHz, SNR >80 dB, 2×12W RMS / 24W RMS total**). Typical pricing places Stage SE in a **higher bracket** than Air V2, but the specs and user-reported voicing aim more squarely at sound quality. [1][8]
