summary: "USB-powered desktop speakers at 25 USD. Provides total 4.4W RMS output, 100Hz–17kHz frequency response, and 86 dB SNR (spec) [1]. Third-party comprehensive measurements are limited, but it delivers sufficient basic performance for entry use. No cheaper current product with equal-or-better functions and performance was found; price rationality is high."

## Overview

The Creative Pebble is a USB-powered 2.0 desktop speaker system at 25 USD. It offers total 4.4W RMS output, 100Hz–17kHz frequency response, and 86 dB SNR (spec) [1], employing a custom-tuned far-field driver solution angled at 45 degrees. The simple design performs both power supply and audio transmission through a single USB cable, optimized for compact desktop environments. Featuring a distinctive spherical design with low-frequency reinforcement through passive radiators. Positioned as an entry-level product intended for basic computer work and casual music listening rather than professional audio applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Creative Pebble provides basic acoustic performance at 25 USD. Under speaker-specific criteria, the 100Hz–17kHz response (spec) is bandwidth-limited, SNR is 86 dB (spec), and total output is 4.4W RMS [1]. As comprehensive third-party measurements are not available, we start from 0.5 and adjust to 0.3 considering the limited bandwidth. For nearfield desktop use, output is sufficient and reasonable for an entry product [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Pebble's technology level remains at a basic level appropriate for its price range. The 45-degree angled driver placement is a practical design decision considering acoustic projection for desktop use, but it is not particularly innovative technology. Single USB cable power and signal transmission prioritizes convenience but requires audio quality compromises. Passive radiator adoption can be understood as a low-frequency reinforcement strategy for limited enclosure volume, but its effectiveness is limited by output constraints. Technical details such as built-in amplifier specifications (Class-D, Class-AB, etc.), impedance characteristics, and crossover frequencies are undisclosed, making it impossible to evaluate the technical validity of the design. The product is presumed to be a combination of industry-standard technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Creative Store price is 24.99 USD [1]. Among currently sold low-cost USB-powered 2.0 speakers, publicly available catalogs generally do not provide sufficient frequency response/SNR data, and output is often lower or unspecified; therefore they cannot be confirmed as “equal-or-better” against Pebble’s published bandwidth (100Hz–17kHz), SNR (86 dB), and total output (4.4W RMS). No cheaper current product with equal-or-better functions and performance was found; therefore CP is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Creative has a track record of manufacturing PC audio equipment for many years, but limited support is expected in the 25 USD price range. Basic product warranty is expected to be provided, but comprehensive support at premium product levels cannot be expected. Due to the simple USB-powered configuration, failure factors are considered relatively few, but specific data on long-term durability of amplifier circuits and drivers is not disclosed. Replacement part availability is also expected to be limited, with product replacement likely being the basic response during failures. Nevertheless, basic customer support can be expected to be provided at a certain level through Creative's international sales network.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Pebble's design philosophy adopts a price-first approach, prioritizing cost reduction over acoustic performance maximization. The decision to keep important technical specifications undisclosed can be interpreted as intending to conceal measured performance inferiority, creating transparency issues. Single USB cable connection prioritizing convenience is understandable as a convenience-focused decision, but compromises occur regarding power quality and signal purity perspectives. Spherical design prioritizes differentiation and compactness but is not acoustically optimal. The 45-degree driver angle can be evaluated as practical consideration but does not constitute fundamental acoustic design improvement. While some rational decisions are included considering the price range, many irrational elements are observed from the perspective of acoustic performance maximization.

## Advice

The Creative Pebble should be positioned as an option when desktop speakers are needed within an extremely limited budget (25 USD). If price and design aesthetics are prioritized over audio quality, and the primary uses are basic computer work and casual music listening, it provides certain value. If budget allows (50 USD or more), invest in products with higher measurement transparency and clearer technical specifications. The Pebble suits “minimum functionality at minimum price” decisions; for audio quality improvement or long-term use, consider other alternatives [1].
