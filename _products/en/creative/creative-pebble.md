summary: "USB-powered desktop speakers available at the low price of 25 USD. Features 4.4W RMS output and 100Hz-17kHz frequency response. While THD and SNR measurement data remain undisclosed, it functions as one of the most affordable products in its price range. Despite inferior cost-performance compared to the Logitech Z120 (16.99 USD), it offers a budget option that balances design aesthetics with basic acoustic performance."

## Overview

The Creative Pebble is a USB-powered 2.0 desktop speaker system offered at the extremely low price of 25 USD. With 4.4W RMS output and 100Hz-17kHz frequency response, it employs a custom-tuned far-field driver solution angled at 45 degrees. The simple design performs both power supply and audio transmission through a single USB cable, optimized for compact desktop environments. Featuring a distinctive spherical design with low-frequency reinforcement through passive radiators. Positioned as an entry-level product intended for basic computer work and casual music listening rather than professional audio applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Creative Pebble provides basic acoustic performance as an extremely low-cost desktop speaker at 25 USD. Evaluated under speaker-specific standards, the 100Hz-17kHz frequency response has limitations within the usage band but represents a reasonable range considering the price. While specific THD and SNR values are undisclosed, expecting measurement data transparency is unrealistic at this price point. The combination of 4.4W RMS output and passive radiator ensures adequate sound pressure levels for desktop use, representing a rational design for products in this price range. While not intended for professional applications, it is suitable for basic computer work and casual music listening.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Pebble's technology level remains at a basic level appropriate for its price range. The 45-degree angled driver placement is a practical design decision considering acoustic projection for desktop use, but it is not particularly innovative technology. Single USB cable power and signal transmission prioritizes convenience but requires audio quality compromises. Passive radiator adoption can be understood as a low-frequency reinforcement strategy for limited enclosure volume, but its effectiveness is limited by output constraints. Technical details such as built-in amplifier specifications (Class-D, Class-AB, etc.), impedance characteristics, and crossover frequencies are undisclosed, making it impossible to evaluate the technical validity of the design. The product is presumed to be a combination of industry-standard technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Creative Pebble achieves excellent cost-performance at the 25 USD price point. As a competitive product with equivalent functionality, the Logitech Z120 sells for 16.99 USD, yielding a CP calculation of 16.99 USD รท 25 USD = 0.68. However, product reviews evaluate the Z120 as "lacking bass compared to the Pebble" and "Creative Pebble being more balanced," indicating the Pebble's superiority in actual acoustic performance. Additionally, it was selected by PCWorld as "Top Pick for Computer Speakers under 100 USD" and evaluated as "producing richer, more immersive audio than commonly found in speakers at twice the price." Considering design aesthetics, basic acoustic performance, and convenience comprehensively, the 25 USD price represents a reasonable setting.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Creative has a track record of manufacturing PC audio equipment for many years, but limited support is expected in the 25 USD price range. Basic product warranty is expected to be provided, but comprehensive support at premium product levels cannot be expected. Due to the simple USB-powered configuration, failure factors are considered relatively few, but specific data on long-term durability of amplifier circuits and drivers is not disclosed. Replacement part availability is also expected to be limited, with product replacement likely being the basic response during failures. Nevertheless, basic customer support can be expected to be provided at a certain level through Creative's international sales network.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Pebble's design philosophy adopts a price-first approach, prioritizing cost reduction over acoustic performance maximization. The decision to keep important technical specifications undisclosed can be interpreted as intending to conceal measured performance inferiority, creating transparency issues. Single USB cable connection prioritizing convenience is understandable as a convenience-focused decision, but compromises occur regarding power quality and signal purity perspectives. Spherical design prioritizes differentiation and compactness but is not acoustically optimal. The 45-degree driver angle can be evaluated as practical consideration but does not constitute fundamental acoustic design improvement. While some rational decisions are included considering the price range, many irrational elements are observed from the perspective of acoustic performance maximization.

## Advice

The Creative Pebble should be positioned as an option when desktop speakers are needed within an extremely limited budget (25 USD). If price and design aesthetics are prioritized over audio quality, and the primary uses are basic computer work and casual music listening, it provides certain value. However, the even more affordable Logitech Z120 at 16.99 USD exists as an alternative, surpassing the Pebble in pure cost-performance. If budget allows (50 USD or more), investment in products with higher measurement performance transparency and clearer technical specifications is strongly recommended. The Pebble is suitable only for situations requiring a compromise decision of "minimum functionality at minimum price," and when considering audio quality improvement or long-term use, it is important to consider other alternatives.
