summary: "USB-C powered desktop speakers with RGB lighting at around 25 USD. Provides up to 4.4W RMS output, 80Hz–20kHz frequency response, SNR 85 dB, and built-in passive radiators [1][2]. Third-party evaluation reports clear sound with limited deep-bass extension typical of 2-inch drivers [3]. Among RGB 2.0 USB-C speakers with equal-or-better measured output, Creative Pebble Pro (RGB, up to 10W RMS) is the cheapest verified alternative at 66.49 USD, yielding a cost-performance score of 0.4 [4][5]."

## Overview

The Creative Pebble SE is a USB-C powered 2.0 desktop speaker system at about 25 USD, essentially an updated version of the original Pebble with added RGB lighting and modern connectivity. It delivers up to 4.4W RMS total output through 2-inch full-range drivers angled at 45 degrees for desktop listening optimization, enhanced by built-in passive radiators for low-frequency reinforcement [1][2]. The distinctive orb-shaped design incorporates seven preset RGB lighting modes. Targeting desktop computer users who prioritize both functionality and aesthetic appeal, the SE maintains the Pebble series’ approachable audio while adding visual enhancement for modern setups.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Manufacturer specifications list frequency response of 80Hz–20kHz and total output up to 4.4W RMS (8.8W peak). Signal-to-noise ratio is specified at 85 dB; distortion (THD) and comprehensive measurement data remain undisclosed [2]. A third-party evaluation characterizes the sound as clear with limited deep-bass extension—consistent with compact 2-inch drivers and passive radiator assistance [3]. Within speaker-specific criteria, the absence of full measurement transparency and the physical bass limits reduce confidence despite reasonable near-field performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The SE adds basic RGB lighting (seven presets) and updates power to USB-C while retaining the 45-degree driver tilt and passive radiators from prior Pebble models. No proprietary DSP or detailed amplifier topology is disclosed, indicating standard implementations rather than novel acoustic technology [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

For RGB 2.0 USB-C desktop speakers with equal-or-better measured output, the lowest verified alternative is **Creative Pebble Pro** at **66.49 USD** (official store). Pebble Pro provides RGB lighting and significantly higher rated power (up to **10W RMS** per official specs) over Pebble SE’s up to 4.4W RMS, while covering similar use cases [4][5]. Based on this comparison, Pebble SE’s cost-performance is assessed at **0.4**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Creative provides standard warranty and a **30-day satisfaction guarantee** for orders placed through the Creative Store [6]. The simple USB-C-powered analog design has fewer failure points than more complex active systems. Non-detachable cables remain a potential weak point.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Intent & target.** The SE aims to be a low-cost, plug-and-play near-field speaker set with modern USB-C power and visual appeal via RGB lighting.  
**Means–ends fit.** The 45° driver tilt favors desktop listening height, and passive radiators help low-frequency presence within the physical limits of 2-inch drivers; the single-cable USB-C power keeps cost and complexity down [1][2].  
**Trade-offs.** Output is modest (up to 4.4W RMS) with limited bass extension, and the cables are non-detachable; these are coherent with the budget constraint and compact form factor [1][3].  
**Transparency.** Basic specs (FR, SNR) are given, but there is no THD graph, FR plot, or amplifier topology disclosure; measurement transparency is therefore limited [1][2].  

Overall, the choices align reasonably with the stated use case and cost target, but limited measurement transparency and emphasis on aesthetics over clear acoustic advances cap the rationality at a moderate **0.4**.

## Advice

Pebble SE suits users prioritizing **aesthetics (RGB)** and **plug-and-play USB-C power** at a very low price. If you value stronger measured output within a similar form factor **and** want to retain RGB, consider **Creative Pebble Pro** (RGB, up to 10W RMS) as the most affordable verified upgrade path from the same brand [4][5]. For audio-only priorities without RGB, stepping up to models with higher power and published measurements remains advisable.
