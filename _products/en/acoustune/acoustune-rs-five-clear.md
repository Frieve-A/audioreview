summary: "Single-dynamic IEM with a beryllium-alloy dome and pragmatic hardware. Independent measurements are not yet available, but the engineering choices are mostly rational. Value is weak versus cheaper, well-measured rivals."

## Overview

The RS Five Clear is a single-dynamic “listening monitor” IEM featuring a 9.2 mm Myrinx EL-B driver in a clear medical-grade resin shell with a stainless nozzle and an aluminum faceplate. It uses a Long-Type **Pentaconn Ear** connector emphasizing robustness and moisture resistance[1]. Typical US street price is around **349.99 USD**[2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Published specs list **20–40,000 Hz** bandwidth, about **110 dB** sensitivity and **32 Ω** impedance (manufacturer/retailer-published values)[2][3]. These are reasonable on paper, but there are **no independent lab measurements** (FR/THD/isolation) yet. Extension to 40 kHz is outside human hearing; pending third-party data we keep the neutral **0.5**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Material and mechanical choices are thoughtful: a thin beryllium-alloy dome driver, precision medical-grade resin shell, stainless nozzle, and **Long-Type Pentaconn Ear** for better contact stability and moisture mitigation[1]. Competent and evolutionary rather than groundbreaking.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.40} $$

Comparator (equal-or-better): **Etymotic ER2XR**, which has extensive third-party measurements and strong passive isolation[5][6]. US pricing we could confirm is **149.99 USD** from the manufacturer store[8], while RS Five Clear sits at **349.99 USD**[2].  
**Calculation:** 149.99 ÷ 349.99 = **0.428…** ⇒ **0.4** (one-decimal rounding).  
A cheaper, well-measured alternative exists; therefore, value is weak.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The official page lists **1-year warranty for the earphones** and **90 days for the cable/accessories**[1]. The Long-Type Pentaconn Ear connector is a sensible choice for durability and contact reliability[1]. Long-term field reliability stats are not yet available.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Assessed **independently of scientific validity**: moisture-resistant Long-Type connectors, medical-grade shell for manufacturing consistency and fit, and a practical accessory set show alignment between purpose and means[1]. The clear shell is mostly aesthetic and 40 kHz bandwidth adds little audible value, so overall we rate the design **moderately rational**.

## Advice

If you prioritize verified performance, start with the **Etymotic ER2XR**[5][6]. The RS Five Clear suits users valuing fit/finish, connector durability, and a clear-shell aesthetic with clear domestic warranty terms. Independent measurements would clarify its standing further.
