## Overview

The SM-SX300 is a 1-bit (delta-sigma) digital power amplifier released in 2004. Manufacturer specs list 150 W per channel into 8 Ω, THD 0.05%, S/N 105 dB, and 5 Hz–100 kHz bandwidth[3]. Contemporary reports put street pricing around 17,000 USD[4]. The chassis featured premium construction such as a copper enclosure and gold-plated connectors.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Based on manufacturer data (no comprehensive third-party lab results found), S/N at 105 dB and wide bandwidth are solid, but THD at 0.05% (1 kHz/1 W) misses typical “transparent” targets (~0.01% or below)[3][11]. By contrast, current designs at similar power commonly achieve THD+N ≈0.006% and SNR 108–110 dB[1]. As such, audible transparency is plausible in many uses, yet not at today’s best-in-class level; score set to 0.4[10][16].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The 1-bit switching approach (64 fs relative to 44.1 kHz) was forward-leaning in its time[5]. However, modern GaN-based Class-D platforms have surpassed it in efficiency and linearity, and are broadly adopted. On present-day yardsticks, sophistication ranks below current industry leaders; 0.3.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Comparator must be the **cheapest equal-or-better** solution[9][13]. Class D Audio **Premium GaN 6.0** provides equivalent user-facing function (stereo power amplification) and **equal-or-better** measured performance (150 W/8 Ω, THD+N 0.006%, SNR 108–110 dB)[1], versus the SM-SX300’s 150 W/8 Ω, THD 0.05%, S/N 105 dB[3]. Using current list prices:  
**975 USD ÷ 17,000 USD = 0.057** → rounded to **0.1**.  
Because a cheaper equal-or-better option exists, CP is fixed at 0.1.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

This is a 2004 model[3]. As a discontinued, vintage unit, factory warranty/support and parts logistics are limited versus current production gear. Age-related component risk further lowers practical reliability, hence 0.2.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Pursuing lower distortion via short digital paths is scientifically coherent, but the product’s very high price with only moderate measured advantage versus today’s common Class-D solutions limits the rational value proposition; 0.5[6].

## Advice

Unless you collect historical digital amps, a modern stereo power amp (e.g., Class D Audio Premium GaN 6.0) will deliver lower distortion/noise at a small fraction of the price[1]. If you need multi-zone plus DSP and network manageability, a distribution amp such as NAD’s CI 8-150 DSP is appropriate[2]. Both routes offer measurably superior value.
