## Overview

The Ruark Audio RS1 is a compact desktop subwoofer designed specifically to complement Ruark's MR1 series speakers. Released as Ruark's first entry into the subwoofer market, the RS1 features a 170mm downward-firing active driver paired with a front-facing passive radiator, powered by a 100W Class D amplifier. The unit measures 300 x 250 x 250mm and weighs 6.7kg, making it suitable for desktop and near-field listening environments. The RS1 includes adjustable crossover controls (50-180Hz) and phase adjustment (0-180°), targeting users seeking to extend the low-frequency response of compact speaker systems.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No independent third-party measurements were found as of the review date. Manufacturer specifications list frequency response 25–200 Hz, a 170 mm treated fibre long-throw active driver with a 170 mm passive radiator, and a 100 W RMS Class D amplifier with auto on/standby and adjustable crossover 50–180 Hz and phase 0–180° [1]. THD, maximum SPL, and on-axis response deviation (±dB) are not published. In the absence of independently verified data (e.g., ground-plane/anechoic sweeps, distortion vs SPL), scientific evaluation remains provisional at 0.5 per policy.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

RS1 uses mainstream architecture: a 170 mm down-firing active driver plus front passive radiator in an MDF cabinet, powered by a 100 W RMS Class D amplifier. Controls are analog (crossover 50–180 Hz, phase 0–180°) with mono RCA input (up to 2.3 Vrms) and auto on/standby; no built-in DSP, app control, EQ, or room correction are provided [1]. These choices are adequate but not novel versus current subwoofers that integrate higher-power amplification with DSP-based filtering and user calibration.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Current US market price observed for RS1: 410 USD (Selfridges US, product page) [2]. The cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative we identified is the RSL Speedwoofer 10E at 339 USD shipped [3]. Equivalence rationale (manufacturer specs): 10E publishes anechoic frequency response 26–200 Hz ±3 dB and 300 W RMS amplification with variable crossover 30–200 Hz and continuously variable phase 0–180°, which meets or exceeds RS1’s user-facing functionality and published bandwidth and power (25–200 Hz manufacturer spec; 100 W RMS; crossover 50–180 Hz; phase 0–180°) [1][3].

CP calculation (USD basis): 339 ÷ 410 = 0.827 → CP = MIN(1.0, 339 ÷ 410) = 0.8.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Ruark provides standard warranty coverage and global distribution. The analog signal path and simple control set reduce firmware risk. However, this is Ruark’s first subwoofer, and long-term field reliability data specific to RS1 is not yet available.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The desktop-first sizing and visual integration with MR1 are coherent choices. From a scientific perspective, the lack of DSP/room tools and modest amplifier power constrain optimization compared with compact subs that add app control, EQ, and higher output. Pricing versus objectively specified alternatives weakens the rationality for achieving transparent low-frequency reproduction [1][3][5].

## Advice

If you prioritize objective performance per dollar, consider the RSL Speedwoofer 10E at 339 USD; it offers wider published anechoic bandwidth (26–200 Hz ±3 dB) and higher RMS power with variable controls at a lower price [3]. If you need deeper extension, SVS SB‑1000 Pro at 599.99 USD publishes 20–270 Hz ±3 dB and includes DSP/app control [5]. If RS1’s size and MR1 styling match your setup, confirm placement and crossover/phase alignment meet your extension/output needs in-room before purchase [1][2].
