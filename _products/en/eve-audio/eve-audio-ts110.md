## Overview

The Eve Audio TS110 is a 10-inch active studio subwoofer using a passive-radiator enclosure and a 400 W PWM amplifier. Manufacturer specs state 28–300 Hz (-3 dB), 108 dB max SPL at 1 m, balanced XLR I/O (stereo in/out plus LFE), switchable satellite filters (full-range / 80 Hz), 0°/180° phase, and variable sub filter 60–140 Hz. An IR remote can adjust both sub and satellite volume from the listening position. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are no comprehensive third-party lab measurements available for the TS110 (frequency response linearity within band, low-frequency THD vs SPL, etc.). The only public figures are manufacturer specs: 28–300 Hz (-3 dB) and 108 dB max SPL at 1 m. Without independent distortion and linearity data, audible transparency cannot be substantiated beyond “typical studio sub” expectations; accordingly we set the baseline 0.5 with provisional reliance on catalog specs. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The TS110 combines a 400 W PWM amplifier with a passive radiator intended to suppress port turbulence and pipe resonances, plus DSP-assisted management for crossover/filters while keeping satellite signal paths analog. The inclusion of an IR remote for system-level volume is practical but not unique industry-wide. Solid, competent implementation with rational engineering, yet no evidence of category-leading innovation. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Market price confirmed at 1,399.99 USD. [2] The cheapest product with **equivalent-or-better user-facing functions and published performance** is JBL’s LSR310S: balanced XLR/TRS I/O with XLR outs, selectable 80 Hz crossover and “External/XLF” modes, 27 Hz low-frequency extension and 113 dB peak SPL (manufacturer). It is widely available at 399 USD. [3][4]  
**CP calculation:** 399 USD ÷ 1,399.99 USD = 0.285 → **0.3** (rounded to one decimal).  
Notes on equivalence: same essential studio integration (balanced I/O, selectable crossover, satellite outputs), comparable or better extension/SPL by spec; IR remote on the TS110 is convenient but not decisive for user-visible performance. [1][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

EVE offers an extended **5-year warranty** for monitors/subwoofers upon registration (applicable from 2025; registration within 60 days). This is above industry average, improving long-term support prospects. Standard retailer listings may still show shorter default terms, but the manufacturer program supersedes once registered. No credible failure-rate data is published. Score slightly above average based on warranty duration and global dealer support. [7][8][2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Using a passive radiator to avoid port noise is a scientifically rational approach for compact subs, and the filter/phase options align with clean satellite integration. DSP usage focused on the sub path while keeping satellites analog is also defensible. Pricing strategy, however, is not aligned with the existence of cheaper subs offering equivalent user-visible capability, which prevents a higher score. [1][3]

## Advice

If you need a balanced studio sub with straightforward integration at the lowest cost, **JBL LSR310S** is the obvious pick given equivalent core functions at a far lower price. [3][4] If you want more headroom, **Kali WS-6.2** (dual-6.5-inch, 27 Hz extension, 120 dB max SPL) or **WS-12** (12-inch, 23 Hz extension, 123 dB max SPL) are strong options albeit pricier. [13][3] **KRK S10.4** is another commonly chosen alternative with balanced I/O and a bypass footswitch; pricing is typically higher than the JBL but still well below the TS110. [5][6] Choose the TS110 specifically if its remote-driven workflow and EVE ecosystem fit your setup needs. [1]
