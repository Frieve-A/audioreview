## Overview

The dbx DriveRack 4800 is a 4-input/8-output loudspeaker management processor featuring 96 kHz DSP, 24-bit converters, analog and AES/EBU I/O, and comprehensive processing (crossovers, EQ, delay, dynamics) with HiQnet network control. It is discontinued and now found on the used market. dbx’s official page documents detailed specifications and also notes THX certification was awarded to the 4800/4820 platform for cinema applications. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specifications for the DriveRack 4800 meet transparency thresholds across the audible band: system dynamic range 112–115 dB (A-weighted), THD+N 0.004% (typ., +4 dBu, 1 kHz), interchannel crosstalk < –85 dB, and frequency response 20 Hz–40 kHz (±0.5 dB) / 20 Hz–20 kHz (±0.25 dB at 96 kHz). These figures indicate audibly transparent processing for crossover/EQ/management roles, with no evidence of performance-limiting artifacts within the audible band. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

For its mid-2000s era, the 4800’s 96 kHz engine, flexible routing, and HiQnet control were advanced. By current standards, converters/DSP, latency, and ecosystem integration have progressed, and modern processors offer higher integration and tooling. Still, the 4800’s core architecture remains competent for transparent loudspeaker management. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Used market pricing for the DriveRack 4800 commonly falls near **1,800 USD**.  
The **cheapest equal-or-better** competitor we could verify is the **Xilica XD-4080** (4×8, 96 kHz, analog + AES/EBU I/O) whose published specs (dynamic range 115 dB typ, THD 0.002%) are not inferior to the 4800. [3] A low market price example is **1,099 USD (used)**. [4]  
**Calculation (explicit):** 1,099 USD ÷ 1,800 USD = **0.61** → **0.6** (rounded to one decimal).

*Note:* If you require current-production with warranty, a new **Linea Research ASC48** (~2,550 USD) also meets/ exceeds transparency but is not cheaper than typical 4800 used pricing; it therefore does not lower the CP score further.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The 4800 is discontinued. Firmware development has ceased and service parts availability is uncertain; long-term reliability depends on unit condition and prior use. For mission-critical installs demanding ongoing manufacturer support and warranty, current models are safer choices. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design focuses on measurable transparency (wide-band FR flatness, low THD+N, high dynamic range) while providing practical system-tuning tools (AFS, EQ, delay, limiters). This resource allocation toward audible performance and field utility is rational, even if more recent platforms improve convenience and ecosystems. [1][2]

## Advice

If you can accept a used, discontinued unit and verify condition, the DriveRack 4800 remains a cost-effective way to achieve audibly transparent loudspeaker management with flexible I/O and robust processing. For buyers needing warranty, software longevity, or ecosystem integration (Dante/Q-SYS, etc.), consider current processors; they will cost more but simplify deployment and future support.
