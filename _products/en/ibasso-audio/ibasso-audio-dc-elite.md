## Overview

The iBasso Audio DC-Elite is a USB DAC/amplifier dongle that miniaturizes the design direction of the company’s flagship DAPs. It adopts ROHM’s DAC chip "BD34301EKV," supports dual outputs (3.5mm SE with SPDIF function / 4.4mm balanced), up to 768kHz/32bit PCM and DSD512 playback, and a 24-step attenuator for precise volume control [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

We add the key manufacturer-claimed numeric specs and will prioritize credible third-party measurements when available [3].

- SNR: 121 dB [3]
- Dynamic Range: 118 dB [3]
- Frequency Response: 10 Hz–50 kHz (±0.5 dB) [3]
- Noise Floor: 3.5 µVrms (at typical volume: <0.9 µV) [3]
- Output Impedance: SE <0.2 Ω / Bal <0.4 Ω [3]
- Max Output Voltage: Bal 4.6 Vrms, SE 2.28 Vrms [3]
- Output example: 162 mW @ 32 Ω (SE) [3]

These values align with our transparent-level thresholds for DAC/amps, indicating practical transparency in use.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Adoption of the desktop-class BD34301EKV, full signal path implementation (FPGA→DAC→I/V→LPF→VOL→AMP), and a 24-step attenuator are technically solid directions [1]. However, they are combinations of existing technologies with limited originality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Market price is around 449 USD. Comparator: iBasso DC07 Pro at 199 USD. Equivalence rationale: dual 3.5mm/4.4mm outputs, high-resolution support, and catalog SNR/THD+N meeting transparent-level thresholds in practice (manufacturer specs basis) [1]. CP calculation: 199 USD ÷ 449 USD = 0.44. The score is set to 0.4 accordingly.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Warranty and RMA statistics are not sufficiently disclosed; we keep this item at industry average for now and will update when primary data becomes available.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Miniaturizing a desktop-class DAC chip into a dongle is a rational approach toward transparency. However, given lower-priced alternatives that reach transparent-level specs and functions, the market rationality of premium pricing is limited [1].

## Advice

The DC-Elite offers high-level design and specs, but at 449 USD there are alternatives like DC07 Pro (199 USD) with limited practical differences for most users [1]. Unless you value the premium DAC chip and attenuator specifically, consider cost-efficient alternatives.
