## Overview

The iBasso DC04PRO is a premium USB DAC/amplifier dongle featuring dual CS43131 flagship DACs and dual RT6863 operational amplifiers in a 4-way fully balanced configuration. This compact 21-gram device supports high-resolution audio formats up to 32-bit/384kHz PCM and native DSD256, while providing both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs with independent 100-step volume controls. The device incorporates advanced technologies including in-house FPGA signal processing algorithms, KDS femtosecond oscillator for jitter reduction, and CNC-milled aluminum construction with tempered glass panels.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The DC04PRO achieves excellent measured performance across key audio quality indicators based on manufacturer specifications. THD+N values of 0.00013% (balanced, 300Ω load) and 0.00018% (single-ended, 300Ω load) substantially exceed the 0.01% transparent threshold [1]. Third-party reviews provide limited confirmation of THD+N performance [4]. Signal-to-noise ratios of 131dBA (balanced) and 127dBA (single-ended) significantly exceed the 105dB transparent level, while dynamic range values of 128dBA and 126dBA similarly surpass requirements. Frequency response is specified at 20Hz-40kHz ±0.5dB, meeting transparent level criteria. Maximum output power of 280mW at 32Ω through balanced output provides sufficient drive capability for most headphones. While comprehensive third-party measurements are limited, available manufacturer specifications indicate performance significantly exceeding transparent thresholds.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The DC04PRO demonstrates solid technical implementation with dual CS43131 DACs providing flagship-level digital-to-analog conversion and dual RT6863 operational amplifiers creating 4-way fully balanced amplification. The device incorporates in-house FPGA algorithms for signal path optimization and jitter reduction, showing meaningful technical expertise. The synchronous DC-DC converter and ultra-low noise LDO regulators demonstrate sophisticated power management design. While the implementation shows technical competence and desirable features that other manufacturers would adopt, the technologies employed are contemporary rather than cutting-edge, and the competitive advantage duration is moderate as similar configurations can be replicated.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

After surveying current market options, no cheaper alternative provides equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance compared to the DC04PRO at 119 USD. The iFi GO Link Max (79 USD) offers similar functionality with dual outputs (3.5mm and 4.4mm balanced), USB-C connectivity, high-resolution audio support up to 32-bit/384kHz and DSD256, and sufficient output power (241mW at 32Ω balanced vs 280mW) [3]. However, it falls short in distortion performance with THD ≤0.0016% (4.4mm) and ≤0.0015% (3.5mm) compared to the DC04PRO's superior 0.00013% THD+N - representing approximately 12x better distortion performance for balanced output. The DUNU DTC 500 (90 USD) provides closer distortion performance with THD+N < 0.0008% and equivalent functionality including ES9038Q2M DAC, dual outputs, and high-resolution support, but still measures significantly higher than the DC04PRO's 0.00013% [5]. As no cheaper option matches the DC04PRO's exceptional distortion performance while providing equivalent functionality, CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

iBasso provides a standard one-year manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship, which is below average for this price category. The device benefits from robust CNC-milled aluminum construction with minimal moving parts, suggesting good inherent reliability. iBasso has maintained an established track record since 2006 in portable audio equipment manufacturing. Customer support is available through form-based communication and authorized dealers globally, with repair pathways including both in-house and brand-level service options. Some isolated reports of USB-C port issues exist in user forums, though general user experiences remain positive.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

iBasso demonstrates exceptional rationality in design philosophy through measurement-focused performance claims and efficient component selection. The dual DAC implementation with balanced amplification provides meaningful technical benefits, while the FPGA signal processing represents genuine innovation in portable audio applications. Costs are directly allocated to functional and performance improvements without excessive luxury features or scientifically questionable elements. The company's approach emphasizes delivering professional-grade audio performance in portable form factors while maintaining accessibility for enthusiasts. The progression from previous models shows clear advancement in functionality and measured performance, supporting a rational development trajectory.

## Advice

The DC04PRO targets users requiring high-performance portable DAC/amplifier functionality with both single-ended and balanced outputs. The device excels for those seeking exceptional measured performance and build quality, with superior distortion performance compared to alternatives like the iFi GO Link Max. The rational design philosophy and solid technical implementation make it suitable for users prioritizing scientific approach to audio reproduction. Given its superior measured performance at this price point, it represents excellent value for users requiring the lowest available distortion levels in portable format.
