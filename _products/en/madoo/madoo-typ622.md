## Overview

MADOO TYP622 is a premium planar-magnetic in-ear monitor featuring a push-pull micro planar “Ortho” driver. The shell is aluminum with a sapphire-crystal viewing window, and the package includes two detachable Pentaconn Ear cables (3.5 mm and 4.4 mm SPC). Key catalog specs: 15 Ω impedance, 20 Hz–40 kHz frequency response, and 5 mW max input [1][2]. The ergonomic design references ear-shape data collected from over 300 individuals [3]. Representative current market pricing is about 899 USD [4][5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At the time of writing, no credible third-party laboratory measurements (e.g., full frequency response with standardized coupler, THD vs SPL, isolation) for TYP622 are publicly available. Manufacturer specs confirm 15 Ω impedance, 20 Hz–40 kHz bandwidth, and 5 mW max input [1][2], but there is no manufacturer THD/THD+N table nor independent verification. Given the absence of verified FR/THD data demonstrating transparent-level performance, this score is provisional and conservative pending independent measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A miniaturized push-pull planar driver is a sound engineering approach for low distortion and fast transient response. The sapphire window (Mohs hardness ~9) is a durable, functional element used as a rigid ported panel, and the CNC-milled aluminum housing with dual stock cables indicates high build attention [1][2]. Still, single-planar IEMs are now common; while the execution is premium, it is not breakthrough relative to the current state of the art.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better): Hidizs MP145 — 159 USD**. MP145 is a planar IEM with third-party measurements showing controlled response on standard couplers (IEC-711/GRAS) and low distortion typical of planar designs [6][7]. User-facing functionality (wired IEM, detachable cable) is equivalent; the TYP622’s inclusion of both 3.5 mm/4.4 mm stock cables is a minor bundle advantage but not essential to function.

Calculation (using representative current prices):  
159 USD ÷ 899 USD = **0.177… → 0.2**.

This places TYP622 at ~5–6× the price of a measured, well-performing planar peer while offering no verified objective performance advantages.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

MADOO is a relatively new brand with limited long-term reliability data in public. Warranty/support information outside Japan is sparse; no field failure-rate or MTBF figures are published. Materials and assembly quality appear high, but empirical reliability evidence is limited at present [1][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Prioritizing a push-pull planar driver and a rigid windowed enclosure is a rational path toward low distortion and stable acoustics. However, without independent measurements to substantiate audible performance gains, the premium pricing strategy is weakly justified when cheaper planar IEMs with solid measured performance exist [6][7].

## Advice

If you value the TYP622’s premium materials/finish and the dual-cable bundle, it may appeal. If your priority is verifiable fidelity per dollar, audition or start with Hidizs MP145 (159 USD) or similar measured planars first [6][7].
