summary: "The Audalytic AH90 is a compact streaming DAC, preamp, and headphone amp built around AK4499EX+AK4191 and XMOS XU316. Manufacturer specs indicate transparency-level figures, while independent third-party measurements remain limited. At 599 USD, it competes directly with the 549 USD FiiO K15, leading to a CP score of 0.9."

## Overview

The Audalytic AH90 combines network streaming (Roon Bridge/UPnP/AirPlay, etc.), USB/optical/coax/LAN inputs, RCA/XLR line outs, and 6.35mm/4.4mm headphone outputs in a small desktop chassis. It uses AKM’s AK4499EX + AK4191 DAC topology and XMOS XU316, supporting up to PCM 768 kHz and DSD512 over USB/LAN, plus MQA decoding［1］［3］. Street price is 599 USD［2］.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Manufacturer specifications** list 20 Hz–20 kHz ±0.2 dB frequency response (line out), dynamic range >127 dB, S/N >126 dB, crosstalk −125 dB @1 kHz, and THD+N ≤0.0001% @1 kHz, with IMD ≈0.001% at −1 dBFS［1］. The balanced 4.4 mm output is specified up to ~1 W into ≤64 Ω［1］. These exceed commonly accepted transparency thresholds, but comprehensive **independent lab measurements** are still scarce; therefore this 0.8 score is a **provisional rating based on manufacturer data** and will be updated when robust third-party results appear.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AH90 is a competent application of current parts—AK4499EX+AK4191, XMOS XU316, and wired LAN streaming—prioritizing clean implementation and I/O coverage rather than novel architectures. No clear evidence of unique patents or proprietary breakthroughs is publicly documented; thus the score reflects solid engineering rather than industry-leading innovation［1］［2］.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator: **FiiO K15 (549 USD)**. It integrates a streamer with Gigabit Ethernet/dual-band Wi-Fi, dual AK4497S DACs, powerful headphone amplification up to 3000 mW @32 Ω balanced, and manufacturer-stated S/N ≥120 dB with THD+N below 0.00055%—comfortably inside transparency limits［4］［5］［6］. From a user perspective (functions + audibly transparent performance), it is **equivalent-or-better**.  
**CP calculation**: 549 USD ÷ 599 USD = 0.92 → **0.9** (rounded to one decimal). AH90 market price used for the denominator: 599 USD［2］.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Long-term field reliability data are limited for the brand. The user manual details a **firmware update mode** (USB-C mass-storage flashing), indicating maintainability［1］. Warranty terms differ by retailer—**1 year (Linsoul)** vs **2 years (ShenzhenAudio)**—so choose channel accordingly［2］［3］. Overall, this suggests an average support outlook at present.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The AH90 targets measurable transparency and practical consolidation (streaming + DAC + preamp + headphone amp) without resorting to non-scientific claims. That balance of measurement-first design and desk-friendly integration is rational for the intended use case［1］［3］.

## Advice

If you want a single wired-LAN hub for PC/NAS playback plus versatile USB/S/PDIF inputs, the AH90 is compelling. **Published specs** indicate transparency-level performance, but those who strictly rely on independent lab data may wish to wait for broader third-party measurements. For pure value, the **FiiO K15 (549 USD)** delivers the same consolidated functions with ample output power and transparency-level numbers at a lower price［4］［5］. Choose AH90 for simple, tidy desktop integration and stable wired streaming; choose K15 for maximum price-performance and drive capability.
