## Overview

KBEAR KW4 is a compact USB-C to 3.5 mm dongle DAC. Listings indicate a Conexant CX31993-class chipset and support up to 32-bit/384 kHz, but independent lab data for this exact model is limited as of this writing[3]. It targets straightforward wired headphone/IEM use on smartphones and PCs.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Because we found no credible third-party bench measurements specifically for KW4, we start at 0.5 and keep it there. Manufacturer-style listings claim high figures such as SNR 130 dB and THD 0.0003% (catalog values)[3], yet repeatable lab verification for KW4 is unavailable. Measurements of other CX31993-based dongles (e.g., 1More USB-C adapter) suggest audibly transparent distortion/noise for typical IEM listening, but those results cannot be directly imputed to KW4 without unit-specific tests[2]. As a result, no positive adjustment is applied.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Spec claims include up to 32-bit/384 kHz and standard UAC compatibility[3]. However, there are no advanced features (balanced out, hardware volume, EQ, etc.) and no measured evidence of technical advantage over well-known baselines. Hence 0.3.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

We select **Apple USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter** as the comparator because it offers the **same user-facing function** and has strong **independent measurements** (low THD+N, low noise, low output impedance, ≈1 Vrms output)[1][2][4].  
- Comparator price: **9 USD**[1]  
- Subject price (KW4): **25 USD**  
- Calculation: **9 USD ÷ 25 USD = 0.36** → rounded to **0.4**

Although Apple’s adapter is limited to 24-bit/48 kHz, published measurements show transparent performance in audible terms, so from the user perspective its functions and measured performance are **equivalent-or-better** for typical wired listening[2][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a simple passive-like form factor, inherent failure risk is modest, but brand-level global support/warranty clarity is limited compared with major vendors. We set 0.4 accordingly.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Providing a tiny, low-cost analog output path for USB-C devices is rational and user-oriented. Without model-specific measurements to substantiate audible superiority, we keep a neutral 0.5.

## Advice

If you want a **known-good baseline** with widely replicated lab data at minimal cost, start with Apple’s dongle[1][2]. If you require **more output power** or **balanced outs**, look at higher-tier dongles or portable amps. KW4’s spec sheet is attractive on paper (32/384), but those claims have not yet been validated by independent testing for this unit—wait for trustworthy measurements if audible performance certainty is important to you.
