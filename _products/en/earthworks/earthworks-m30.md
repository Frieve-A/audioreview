## Overview

The Earthworks M30 is a professional measurement microphone designed for acoustic measurement applications, featuring an exceptional frequency response from 3Hz to 30kHz with consistent omnidirectional polar response. Developed by Earthworks Audio, a company founded by David Blackmer (inventor of the dbx noise reduction system and Blackmer VCA), the M30 utilizes proprietary small-diaphragm condenser technology optimized for measurement precision. Each unit is individually hand-tuned and tested, delivered with its own printed frequency response chart and Electronic Calibration File (ECF). The microphone offers 140dB SPL capability without distortion, requires 24-48V phantom power, and features robust stainless steel construction immune to most temperature and atmospheric fluctuations.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The M30 demonstrates mixed but generally strong measurement performance across key technical indicators. Maximum SPL capability reaches 140dB SPL, meeting excellent level criteria for professional microphones. However, equivalent noise level at 20dB SPL (A-weighted) sits exactly at the problematic threshold boundary. The standout performance lies in frequency response characteristics: the 3Hz-30kHz range significantly exceeds typical measurement microphone specifications, with third-party measurements confirming ±0.5dB deviation when using manufacturer Electronic Calibration Files [1]. This frequency extension well beyond the audible range and tight deviation tolerances represent significant technical advantages for measurement applications. Conservative evaluation applies due to reliance on manufacturer specifications for some key metrics, though available third-party verification supports the frequency response claims.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The M30 represents advanced technological achievement in measurement microphone design. Earthworks employs proprietary patent technology developed by David Blackmer, featuring complete in-house design from capsule to electronics with individual hand-tuning protocols. The extended frequency response technology demonstrates technical desirability that competitors attempt to match, while the Electronic Calibration File approach has become industry-adopted. The company maintains high technical expertise accumulation since 1995, with sustained competitive advantage requiring significant infrastructure investment for individual calibration processes. However, the design remains primarily analog/mechanical without advanced digital integration compared to modern measurement approaches incorporating software, AI, or cloud technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price: 699 USD. Investigation of equivalent-or-better measurement microphones reveals no cheaper alternatives providing the M30's comprehensive functionality. The Behringer ECM8000 (29 USD) offers only 15Hz-20kHz response with 2dB deviations, significantly inferior to the M30's 3Hz-30kHz range and ±0.5dB accuracy. The miniDSP UMIK-1 (79 USD) provides 20Hz-20kHz ±1dB response with 133dB maximum SPL, both specifications inferior to the M30. The Dayton Audio EMM-6 (40 USD) delivers 18Hz-20kHz response with 127dB maximum SPL, substantially below M30 capabilities. Professional-grade alternatives like Brüel & Kjær measurement microphones offer frequency ranges limited to 6.3Hz-20kHz, lacking the M30's extended 30kHz capability. No investigated products provide equivalent-or-better user-facing functions and measured performance, establishing the M30 as the cheapest option among equivalent alternatives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Earthworks provides standard 2-year warranty coverage for electronic components and moving parts, with direct manufacturer support via phone and email through established Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) systems. The robust stainless steel body construction features simple capsule design with few moving parts, claimed immunity to temperature and atmospheric fluctuations, and individual hand-tuning reducing unit-to-unit variation. Professional repair services offer one-week turnaround times with reasonable costs (80% of total cost for out-of-warranty repairs). The M30 benefits from nearly 20-year track record in professional measurement applications, proven reliability in diverse environmental conditions including scientific research laboratories and professional touring. Individual calibration files and Electronic Calibration File download availability ensure long-term support, with recommended 5-year recalibration intervals suggesting sustained measurement accuracy.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Earthworks demonstrates rational measurement-focused scientific development with individual calibration and testing protocols. Founded by engineer David Blackmer with established measurement technology background, the company emphasizes measurable performance characteristics over subjective claims. The extended frequency response directly contributes to measurement accuracy improvement, while individual calibration ensures optimal performance for intended applications. Electronic Calibration File systems provide genuine user value through improved measurement precision. Design philosophy focuses on extending frequency response beyond conventional limits (30kHz versus typical 20kHz) with continuous refinement of calibration and manufacturing processes. Advanced functional integration optimized for measurement applications provides clear justification for specialized equipment versus general audio microphones. Proprietary capsule technology and calibration systems contribute directly to measurement performance through scientific approaches to achieving accuracy improvements.

## Advice

The Earthworks M30 represents the premium choice for users requiring extended frequency response measurement capabilities beyond conventional 20kHz limitations. Recommended for professional acousticians, audio engineers, and researchers conducting measurements requiring accuracy in extended frequency ranges. The individual calibration and ECF files justify the investment for applications where measurement precision directly impacts results quality. Consider the M30 when measurement applications involve extended frequency content analysis, professional acoustic consulting, or research requiring documented calibration traceability. Budget-conscious users performing basic 20Hz-20kHz measurements may find adequate performance in alternatives like the Behringer ECM8000 or miniDSP UMIK-1, though at significant performance trade-offs in frequency range and accuracy. The robust construction and professional support infrastructure make the M30 suitable for field measurement applications and long-term professional use.
