## Overview

The Behringer C-2 is a small-diaphragm cardioid condenser microphone released in 2008, typically sold as a matched stereo pair. Featuring 16mm capsules with transformerless FET input circuitry, the C-2 targets entry-level recording applications requiring professional XLR connectivity and phantom power operation. The design includes essential functionality such as -10dB pad switching and high-pass filtering at 120Hz, representing Behringer's "Double the Features at Half the Price" philosophy in the professional microphone segment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Based on manufacturer specifications, the C-2 demonstrates mixed measured performance characteristics [1]. Self-noise measures 19.0 dB-A, positioning it between the transparent level (10dB-A) and problematic threshold (20dB-A) defined for professional microphones. Maximum SPL capability reaches 150dB, significantly exceeding the excellent threshold of 140dB and providing substantial headroom for high-level recording applications. Frequency response spans the standard 20Hz-20kHz range with a documented presence boost averaging 4dB between 1-8kHz [2]. Compared to current digital microphone technology offering DSP-based noise reduction and real-time processing capabilities, the C-2's purely analog approach lacks advanced signal processing that could improve signal-to-noise ratios below the 10dB-A transparent threshold. Modern USB microphones with integrated ADC and digital signal processing achieve significantly better self-noise performance through computational noise suppression, representing technological advancement beyond the C-2's 2008-era analog implementation. Given the conservative evaluation approach required for manufacturer-only specifications without third-party verification, the 0.4 score reflects performance at the midpoint between problematic and transparent levels, suitable for controlled recording environments but potentially limiting in quiet source applications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The C-2 employs basic transformerless FET input circuitry representing mature condenser microphone technology from its 2008 release period [3]. Despite demonstrating in-house design ownership (+0.1), the implementation suffers from outdated technology (-0.1) and purely analog/mechanical construction without digital integration (-0.1), resulting in the 0.3 score. The 16mm capsule configuration and switchable pad/filter functionality represent standard professional features rather than advanced technical development. Technology integration remains purely analog and mechanical, lacking modern digital signal processing or contemporary innovations found in current microphone designs. The conservative engineering approach prioritizes proven performance characteristics over cutting-edge technical advancement, limiting competitive differentiation and technical desirability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 30 USD per microphone (typically sold as 60 USD pair), the C-2 demonstrates exceptional cost-performance positioning [4]. Comprehensive market analysis reveals no XLR condenser microphones with equivalent specifications available at lower pricing. The Audio-Technica AT2020 (99 USD) provides equivalent functionality including XLR connectivity, phantom power operation, and comparable frequency response (20Hz-20kHz), with similar self-noise (20.0 dB-A vs 19.0 dB-A) and maximum SPL performance (144dB vs 150dB) [5]. The Rode M3 (159 USD) offers equivalent user-facing features including XLR output and phantom power requirements with similar cardioid polar pattern and professional connectivity. Both comparison targets provide equivalent-or-better user functionality through identical XLR connectivity, phantom power requirements, and professional recording capabilities, while the C-2 achieves comparable measured performance at significantly lower cost. CP = 30 USD ÷ 30 USD = 1.0, as no cheaper equivalent exists.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Behringer provides standard one-year warranty coverage extendable to three years through product registration within 90 days of purchase [6]. The company maintains global manufacturer support infrastructure including authorized service centers and online technical assistance. Simple transformerless FET circuitry with minimal moving components contributes to inherent reliability through robust analog design resistant to electronic degradation. Standard warranty periods and manufacturer-direct support channels provide above-average reliability backing compared to typical consumer audio products. Repair and replacement services follow established protocols through authorized dealers and Music Tribe Community support systems.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Behringer's design philosophy demonstrates rational cost-effectiveness principles aligned with providing basic professional functionality at accessible pricing [7]. The "Double the Features at Half the Price" approach focuses development resources on essential functions while eliminating non-critical features, resulting in transparent cost optimization. Conservative engineering methodology prioritizes proven FET technology over experimental approaches, ensuring reliable performance through mature circuit implementations. However, the explicitly conservative technical stance limits innovation potential and advancement beyond established industry standards. Development costs directly contribute to core microphone functionality without unnecessary feature proliferation, though the analog-only approach foregoes contemporary digital processing advantages that could enhance performance or user experience.

## Advice

For users requiring affordable XLR condenser microphones with professional connectivity, the C-2 represents exceptional value through competitive specifications at entry-level pricing. The 19.0 dB-A self-noise may limit applications involving quiet sources or distant miking, making it most suitable for close-proximity recording of moderately loud sources. Excellent 150dB maximum SPL capability accommodates high-volume recording scenarios including percussion and amplified instruments. The stereo pair configuration benefits applications requiring matched microphone characteristics for stereo recording techniques. Users prioritizing maximum performance or working in acoustically sensitive environments should consider higher-specification alternatives despite significantly increased costs.
