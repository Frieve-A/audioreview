summary: "A very low-cost 2-in/2-out USB interface with Midas-branded preamps and 24-bit/192 kHz support. It covers basic tasks, but measured performance and maximum output level are limited; cost-performance is excellent only because it is the cheapest equivalent option."

## Overview

The Behringer UMC202HD is a compact 2-in/2-out USB 2.0 audio interface aimed at entry-level recording. It provides two XLR/TRS combo inputs with Midas-designed preamps, phantom power, direct monitoring, and 24-bit/192 kHz converters. Bus power keeps the setup simple, and basic monitoring and software bundles target singer-songwriters and home-studio starters. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Manufacturer documentation lists output frequency response of 10 Hz-43 kHz (0 / +0.3 dB), **dynamic range 110 dB(A)**, and **maximum line output +3 dBu (-1.09 Vrms)**. These numbers indicate usable-but not high-headroom. Community loopback tests show distortion artifacts rising well before full scale (e.g., clarity only up to about **-17.6 dBFS** with spurious HF peaks), pointing to implementation limits of the analog input buffer and overall noise behavior. Taken together, audible-domain transparency is compromised versus better-measuring peers. [2][7]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The UMC202HD combines mainstream converter tech (24-bit/192 kHz), bus-powered USB 2.0, and budget analog stages. The Midas-branded preamps are a highlight on paper, but cost-optimized op-amp stages and filtering constrain results. There is no notable innovation beyond standard feature coverage. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Current market price: 58 USD**. For an equal-or-better comparator, we identified **M-Audio M-Track Duo HD**: also 2-in/2-out with 24-bit/192 kHz converters, phantom power, and balanced outs-**functions and headline specs are equivalent** from a user perspective. Its market price is **77 USD**, making the UMC202HD the **cheapest** option among equivalent-or-better products; therefore **CP = 1.0** by definition. [1][3][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Default warranty is 1 year, extendable to **3 years upon registration within 90 days**, which is positive for a budget interface. Drivers are provided for Windows (CoreAudio on macOS). We did not find robust failure-rate data; thus we assign a neutral score. [2][6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product follows a pragmatic, cost-reduction approach focused on baseline features with no occult or unscientific claims. While measured performance is modest, the design goals are transparent and utilitarian rather than marketing-driven excess.

## Advice

Choose the UMC202HD when you need the **cheapest functional** 2-in/2-out interface for sketches, podcasts, or learning DAWs and can accept limited headroom and modest measured performance. If you want stronger measured transparency and higher output levels, consider saving for alternatives from Focusrite, Presonus, Audient, or MOTU-expect to spend more. If you stay with the UMC202HD, keep gains conservative to avoid early distortion, and verify driver setup on Windows. [3][5]
