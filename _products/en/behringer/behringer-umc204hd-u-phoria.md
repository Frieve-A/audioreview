rating: [2.6, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0, 0.5, 0.3]
price: 120
summary: "Affordable 2-in/4-out USB interface with MIDI and inserts. Measurements show distortion rising near full scale and modest noise performance, but functionality is rich. No cheaper equivalent-or-better alternative exists, so cost-performance is maxed out."

## Overview

The UMC204HD is a 24-bit/192 kHz USB-powered audio interface offering 2 inputs, 4 outputs, MIDI I/O, inserts, and direct monitoring. Its I/O count and routing flexibility suit home recording, streaming, and simple outboard loops. This review focuses on measured performance and user-visible functions rather than brand perception [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Third-party measurements at 44.1 kHz show a clear rise in distortion near full-scale; above roughly −3 dBFS performance worsens, while backing off the level drops distortion below −100 dB and lowers the noise floor by about 35 dB [1]. The manufacturer lists 110 dB (A-weighted) dynamic range and 10 Hz–43 kHz (0/+0.3 dB) frequency response, but those are catalog specs; in practice the unit doesn’t consistently reach transparency versus today’s best interfaces, hence this score [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Feature implementation is solid for the price: 24-bit/192 kHz operation, MIDI I/O, analog inserts, and a mix-balance direct monitor control [2]. However, as a bus-powered design at this price, noise and distortion control is behind modern upper-tier competitors. It’s competent engineering rather than novel innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Street price is about 120 USD. **Among finished products with equal-or-better user functions (2-in/4-out plus MIDI) and practical measured performance, we could not find any cheaper option.** Typical alternatives such as the Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 (4-in/4-out with MIDI, ~199.99 USD) [4][5] and MOTU M4 (4-in/4-out with MIDI, ~269.95 USD) [3][8] cost more. PreSonus AudioBox USB 96 (~99 USD) includes MIDI but only offers 2 outputs, so it is not equivalent [6]. With no cheaper equivalent, CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Default warranty is one year, extendable to **three years** if you register within 90 days (terms and exclusions apply) [7]. That support level is average for this segment. Frequent firmware updates are not critical for this category, but we recommend registering for the extended coverage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Prioritizing generous I/O and routing at low cost is rational. Still, measured behavior near full scale and modest noise performance mean it doesn’t fully pursue “transparent-by-measurement” goals like the latest top performers [1].

## Advice

If you need 4 analog outputs plus MIDI on a tight budget, this is a strong pick. If you value higher measured performance and nicer metering, consider Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 (~199.99 USD) [4][5] or MOTU M4 (~269.95 USD) [3][8]. If two outputs suffice, PreSonus AudioBox USB 96 (~99 USD) is cheaper, but it doesn’t replace the UMC204HD’s 4-out and insert flexibility [6].
