summary: "Ultra-budget 8\" passive PA loudspeaker. Manufacturer specs indicate limited bandwidth and output vs transparent targets, but its ultra-low street price and lack of a cheaper equal-or-better alternative make CP a full 1.0."

## Overview

The Behringer PK108 is a compact 2-way passive PA loudspeaker with an 8-inch LF driver and 1-inch compression driver. It’s rated at 320–350 W peak, sensitivity 96 dB (1 W/1 m), with 70°H × 50°V coverage, and weighs about 11.2 lb (5.1 kg). Connectivity is via **two 4-pin speaker twist (speakON-style) jacks** (input/link), plus a 35 mm pole socket for mounting. [1][2][3][4]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

With no credible third-party measurements located, we start from 0.5 and adjust. Manufacturer-published data shows 87 Hz–35 kHz (±3 dB) / 20 Hz–20 kHz (−10 dB) and 96 dB sensitivity (1 W/1 m). [2][3] The high LF cutoff limits full-range fidelity, and the 70°×50° pattern implies modest uniformity in larger spaces. Absent verified THD/IMD and max SPL data, audible transparency is limited, hence 0.4. [1][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A conventional 2-way passive network (≈2.2 kHz crossover) in a molded enclosure with no notable proprietary acoustics or advanced networks. It’s pragmatic but not innovative, so below industry-average sophistication. [2][4]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Current market price (denominator)**: **70.90 USD**. [5]  
We searched for the **cheapest equal-or-better** passive alternative. Rockville’s **RSG8** is cheaper at **64.95 USD** but lists **90 dB** sensitivity (≈6 dB lower than PK108), and **300 W peak** vs PK108’s 320–350 W—both indicating **inferior output capability**; therefore it does **not** meet the “equal-or-better performance” requirement and cannot be the comparator. [6][7]  
**Conclusion**: No cheaper product with equal-or-better user-facing functions and measured performance found → **CP = 1.0** (by definition, world-cheapest among equivalents).

(For clarity only: if RSG8 qualified, the raw division would be 64.95 ÷ 70.90 = 0.915…, but it doesn’t qualify.)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Global distribution and standard warranty under Music Tribe. Passive architecture reduces failure points, but independent long-term durability data is scarce; overall, approximately industry-average support and reliability. [1][4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design trades bandwidth and uniformity for portability and cost with no occult claims—reasonable for speech and small-PA utility. It doesn’t push toward transparent benchmarks, but the choices are coherent for the price target. [1][2]

## Advice

Choose PK108 when you need the **lowest possible entry cost** for speech reinforcement or very small gigs/monitoring. For music programs needing deeper LF, higher output, or documented low distortion, consider stepping up within Behringer’s range or competitors that publish comprehensive measurements; verify frequency response, sensitivity, and distortion before purchase. [2][4]
