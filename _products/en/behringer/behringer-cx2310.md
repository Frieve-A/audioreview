## Overview

The Behringer Super-X Pro CX2310 V2 is a stereo 2-way/mono 3-way analog crossover featuring Linkwitz-Riley 24dB/octave filters, balanced XLR I/O, a dedicated subwoofer output, and a 25Hz input low-cut. The V2 revision adds a universal 100-240V power supply. At 119 USD, it targets users who need dependable band-splitting on a tight budget.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Per manufacturer-published data, the CX2310 employs LR 24dB/oct filters; published performance figures for the V2 generation indicate wide bandwidth (±10Hz-60kHz, +0/-3dB class), output-dependent S/N typically >95-97dB, and low interchannel crosstalk for the band outputs[1][2][3]. These align with the theory of LR filters (flat summed response, good phase behavior). However, comprehensive third-party measurements (full-band THD+N across levels/loads) remain limited, so this assessment relies primarily on manufacturer specifications at present.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This is a conventional analog, state-variable LR24dB crossover. The V2's universal SMPS improves practicality, but there's no step-change in algorithms or control. It's a solid, standard design rather than a technological leap[1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Equivalence note (summary):** dbx 223xs offers the same user-facing functions (stereo 2-way/mono 3-way, LR24dB, balanced XLR) and equal-or-better measured performance (e.g., THD+N <0.004%, S/N >94dB)[5][6].

The **dbx 223xs** is thus a valid comparator; current new-unit market price is **269 USD**[7]. Cheaper units exist, but fail the equal-or-better threshold: for example **Rockville RX230** (THD ≤0.02% class and incomplete crosstalk disclosure) does not meet or exceed the CX2310's published performance[8], while **Nady CX-23SW** uses 12dB/oct filters (not LR24dB), which does not satisfy the functional parity requirement[9]. Since **no cheaper equal-or-better** product is identified, CP per policy is **1.0** (USD basis).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a mainstream pro-audio utility device, the CX2310 V2 provides adequate documentation, standard warranty and a practical, universal PSU[1]. It's not aimed at extreme long-haul, premium service environments, but nothing in the public record suggests atypical weaknesses for its class.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The product focuses on achieving the intended function (band-splitting) with a rational LR24dB topology and the essential controls at minimal cost. It prioritizes affordability and practicality rather than chasing maximal transparency metrics.

## Advice

For budget PA rigs, small venues, and training environments where dependable band-splitting matters more than squeezing the last dB of THD+N or crosstalk, the CX2310 is an appropriate choice. If you prioritize independently verified low distortion/noise margins and higher-end construction, consider stepping up to units like the dbx 223xs.
