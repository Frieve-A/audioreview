## Overview

The Technics SU-G700M2 is a digital integrated amplifier released in October 2021. As part of Technics' Grand Class series, it is positioned as a product that inherits technology from the higher-end SU-R1000 while maintaining a lower price point. With an output power of 70W into 8Ω and 140W into 4Ω loads, it incorporates proprietary digital technologies such as the JENO Engine and LAPC. The design is comprehensive for modern audio systems, including an MC/MM phono stage, a DSD-compatible DAC, and extensive digital inputs.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

According to Stereophile measurements, the harmonic distortion at 1W is approximately 0.01%, achieving transparent levels. However, the S/N ratio is 67.7dB (A-weighted), falling significantly below the problem-level threshold of 80dB. This represents a serious performance deficiency, 37.3dB below the transparency standard of 105dB or higher for modern high-performance equipment. While the frequency response of 5Hz-80kHz (-3dB) is excellent, the S/N ratio issue severely compromises its overall scientific validity. The presence of 720mV of ultrasonic noise centered at 67kHz, characteristic of digital amplifiers, also indicates limitations in its measured performance. Although THD achieves transparent levels, the significant S/N ratio deficiency limits the overall performance to a problematic level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The amplifier incorporates advanced proprietary Technics digital technologies, including the JENO Engine (Jitter Elimination and Noise-Shaping Optimization) for jitter removal and noise-shaping, and LAPC (Load Adaptive Phase Calibration) for phase correction adapted to the speaker load. The power supply section features an Advanced Speed Silent Power Supply (AS²PS) using GaN (Gallium Nitride) FETs and SiC (Silicon Carbide) diodes, enabling efficient power delivery through high-speed switching. These technologies demonstrate an advanced level that exceeds industry standards, with particularly high technical achievement in the digital amplifier domain.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The SU-G700M2 is priced at 2699 USD. After investigating the global market for the cheapest product with equivalent or superior features and performance, the Yamaha A-S801 (approx. 900 USD) was identified. The A-S801 offers 100W (8Ω) of power and a DAC supporting DSD 5.6MHz and PCM 384kHz/32bit, providing superior basic performance to this unit, with the exception of lacking an MC phono input. The cost-performance is calculated as 900 USD ÷ 2699 USD = 0.333..., resulting in a rounded score of 0.3. While Technics offers proprietary digital technologies and MC phono compatibility as added value at roughly three times the price, the rationality of this price difference is low when considering basic performance metrics like the S/N ratio.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Technics brand is supported by the reliable manufacturing system of its parent company, Panasonic, with quality control expected to exceed the industry average. As a Japanese manufacturer, it maintains an appropriate support system for warranty and repairs. However, long-term reliability data in the relatively new field of digital amplifiers is still being accumulated, and there are some unknowns compared to traditional analog amplifiers. It does not include firmware update functionality, but this is not an essential feature for this product category. Overall, it can be evaluated as providing reliability and support above the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The adoption of a full-digital amplifier architecture is a rational approach that minimizes signal degradation in the analog stages. The direction of technological development, including jitter elimination via the JENO Engine and load-adaptive control through LAPC, which directly contributes to measurable performance improvements, is scientifically sound. The use of GaN FETs and SiC diodes to improve power efficiency is also a rational choice that aims to balance environmental impact reduction with sound quality improvement. Support for high-resolution formats up to PCM 384kHz/32bit and DSD 11.2MHz ensures compatibility with future high-quality sources. These advanced technologies are commendable.

## Advice

The SU-G700M2 is a product whose performance raises questions about its rationality at a price of 2699 USD. The existence of the more affordable Yamaha A-S801 (approx. 900 USD), which, while lacking an MC phono input, surpasses it in power output and DAC capabilities, makes it difficult to justify the nearly threefold price difference. In particular, the measured S/N ratio of 67.7dB, which is at a problematic level, fails to meet the fidelity expected from a high-priced amplifier. It is difficult to actively recommend this product to anyone other than users who absolutely require an MC phono input and find strong value in Technics' proprietary digital technologies. Even when considering a purchase, one should carefully compare it with more cost-effective alternatives like the Yamaha A-S801 to determine if the price difference truly offers commensurate value.
