## Overview

The Technics SU-R1000 represents a sophisticated digital integrated amplifier featuring the company's proprietary JENO Engine technology and full-digital amplification architecture. Delivering 150W per channel into 8 ohms (300W into 4 ohms), this unit converts all analog inputs to digital before amplification through a switching output stage. Key features include comprehensive analog and digital inputs, support for 32-bit/384kHz PCM and DSD512 formats, and advanced technologies like Load Adaptive Phase Calibration (LAPC) and Active Distortion Cancelling.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent measurements indicate **mixed** performance. Channel separation is excellent—**>100 dB** below ~2.5 kHz and **67 dB** at 20 kHz. With the line inputs, A-weighted S/N at the speaker outputs measured **74.4 dB** (2.83 V into 8 Ω; wideband unweighted **48.2 dB**). With both channels driven, sustained power exceeded spec at **190 W/ch (8 Ω)** and **355 W/ch (4 Ω)** at 1% THD+N; **THD+N ≈0.03% at 50 W**. USB accepted up to **32-bit/768 kHz**; practical resolution from digital inputs was **~17–18 bits** under test. These results justify a neutral score rather than “exceptional measured performance.” [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The SU-R1000 integrates multiple proprietary, forward-leaning ideas: the **JENO Engine** (jitter reduction, noise-shaping with PWM conversion, **battery-driven master clock**), **LAPC** (DSP-based amplifier/speaker response optimization), and the **Advanced Speed Silent Power Supply (AS2PS)** using a fixed switching frequency in the **~400 kHz band**. The chassis employs **four independent power-supply blocks** and GaN-FETs in the switching supply. This full-digital signal path is unusual among integrated amplifiers and reflects significant R&D investment. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comparator: **Anthem STR Integrated** — onboard DAC + **MM/MC phono**, **ARC Genesis** room correction; rated **200 W/8 Ω** & **400 W/4 Ω** (both channels, 20 Hz–20 kHz). Independent bench: **≈225 W/8 Ω** and **≈375 W/4 Ω** at 1% THD+N. Official U.S. price **4,999.99 USD**. CP calculation (USD): **0.526 → 0.5**. Given SU-R1000’s 9,499 USD pricing versus an equal-or-stronger alternative with broad functionality and verified high power, CP is mid-level rather than very low. [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Technics provides a dedicated **Support Hub** with warranty and service information plus contact options. **Live chat is available Monday–Friday 9 AM–5 PM EST**, with an after-hours chatbot. Independent testing observed thermal protection triggering at **127.9°F / 52.9°C**, so ensure adequate ventilation. [1][6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Technics states it follows **100+ internal rules** to realize its target “Technics Sound,” emphasizing measurement-driven development, iterative reviews, and material choice. The digital-first approach—JENO, **DSP-based LAPC**, ADCT, and advanced power-supply engineering—forms a coherent philosophy aimed at measurable noise/distortion control, even if not every lab metric is class-leading. [2][7]

## Advice

For listeners who value an advanced, all-digital architecture and features like LAPC and a high-spec phono/DAC implementation, the SU-R1000 is compelling. Objectively, expect **strong power delivery and excellent channel separation** but **only moderate S/N** at the speaker outputs versus some competitors. Given the price, weigh it against lower-cost units (e.g., Anthem STR) that offer equal or greater power and broad functionality, and allow for **good ventilation** in setup. [1][4][5]
