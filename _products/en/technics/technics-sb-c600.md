## Overview

The Technics SB-C600 is a 2-way coaxial bookshelf speaker system featuring a 15cm aluminum cone woofer with integrated 25mm aluminum dome tweeter. Released in November 2021 as part of Technics' Premium C600 series, these speakers employ the company's Linear Phase Plug technology and Smooth Flow Diaphragm design. With a coaxial driver configuration reminiscent of KEF's approach, the SB-C600 targets the competitive 1000 USD bookshelf speaker market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The SB-C600 lacks comprehensive third-party measurements from established spinorama databases. Manufacturer specifications claim 40 Hz–100 kHz frequency range (-10 dB), with sensitivity 83 dB (2.83 V/m) and 4-ohm nominal impedance, which indicates relatively low efficiency and substantial amplification requirements [1]. In absence of independent THD/IMD/FR datasets, objective assessment remains provisional and based on manufacturer numbers pending third-party data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The coaxial driver design with Linear Phase Plug represents solid engineering, achieving point-source radiation characteristics for improved imaging. The Smooth Flow Diaphragm and Balanced Driver Mounting Architecture demonstrate thoughtful vibration control implementation. However, the technology level remains industry-standard rather than innovative. Coaxial drivers are well-established technology, and while Technics' implementation appears competent, it doesn't advance beyond existing solutions from KEF, Tannoy, or other established coaxial specialists. The cabinet construction and crossover design appear conventional without notable technical advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Price basis (US market): the SB-C600 is available at 1,099.99 USD per pair [2]. The cheapest equal-or-better comparator with public third-party measurements is Polk Audio Reserve R200 at 749 USD per pair (ListenUp) [3], with detailed Klippel NFS data demonstrating neutral response and solid distortion performance [4].

CP calculation (policy formula):

CP = 749 USD ÷ 1,099.99 USD = 0.68 → rounded to 0.7

Note: Comparator selection is provisional because SB-C600 lacks public spinorama. R200 is judged equal-or-better on user-facing performance based on independent measurements [4]. Pricing excludes short-term sales per policy and uses representative current market prices [2][3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Technics offers standard manufacturer warranty and support through established dealer networks. As passive speakers without firmware requirements, long-term reliability concerns focus primarily on driver longevity and cabinet construction quality. Technics' reputation for build quality provides reasonable confidence, though the company's relatively recent re-entry into high-end audio markets means limited long-term reliability data exists for current product lines. Support infrastructure appears adequate but not exceptional compared to established competitors.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The coaxial design is scientifically sound for coherent point‑source radiation and the product does not rely on non‑scientific claims. However, the 83 dB sensitivity at 4 Ω imposes higher amplifier demands without clear audible benefits, and the 100 kHz extension is of limited practical value [1]. Compared with transparency‑first designs backed by public measurements, the prioritization here is only moderately rational. The result is a below‑average but not occult‑level score.

## Advice

The SB-C600 suits users seeking a compact coaxial bookshelf speaker and who already own powerful amplification. Expect to budget 60 W+ per channel into 4 Ω. If prioritizing value with objective data, consider Polk Reserve R200 (third-party measurements available) and verify current market pricing before purchase [3][4].
