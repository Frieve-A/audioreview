## Overview

The Technics EAH-AZ80 is a premium true wireless earbuds released by Panasonic in 2023. Featuring 10mm free-edge aluminum alloy drivers with LDAC support for 24-bit/96kHz hi-res audio playback. Key features include 3-device multipoint connectivity, dual hybrid active noise cancellation, and 7-hour continuous playback (24 hours with case). Currently priced at USD 165 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 10mm aluminum alloy drivers deliver 20Hz-40kHz frequency response with LDAC support for 24-bit/96kHz hi-res audio, demonstrating measurable effectiveness. RTINGS measurements confirm flat midrange with excellent instrument detail reproduction. However, measured bass bloat and slight treble veiling prevent completely transparent reproduction. SoundGuys awarded 4.2 overall rating while noting SBC encoding distortion issues.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 10mm free-edge aluminum alloy drivers with internal acoustic control chamber and harmoniser technology achieve above-industry-average technical standards. Dual hybrid active noise cancellation (feedforward/feedback) and JustMyVoice technology with 8 MEMS microphone arrays demonstrate proprietary innovation. However, fundamental driver technology represents existing technology extensions without revolutionary acoustic engineering breakthroughs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Compared to Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (current USD 129 USD, 8.5-hour battery life, equivalent active noise cancellation), the Technics EAH-AZ80 (current USD 165 USD, 7-hour battery life) shows good cost performance. CP = USD 129 รท USD 165 = 0.78, resulting in 0.8 evaluation. Considering the unique 3-device multipoint connectivity feature, appropriate pricing level confirmed versus competing products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Panasonic's 2-year warranty and global support infrastructure provide above-industry-standard reliability. IPX4 water resistance rating ensures daily use durability with regular firmware updates maintained. Technics Audio Connect app provides comprehensive customization functions suitable for long-term use. Aluminum charging case build quality and durability receive high evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 10mm aluminum alloy driver sound quality-focused design and 3-device multipoint connectivity convenience improvements are rational. 7g earbud weight and IPX4 water resistance demonstrate practical considerations. However, 7-hour battery life is shorter than competitors and larger case size affects portability. LDAC usage increases battery consumption and LDAC disabling during 3-device connection creates feature tradeoffs.

## Advice

Technics EAH-AZ80 suits users prioritizing sound quality with 3-device multipoint connectivity needs. Particularly valuable for LDAC-supported high-resolution audio playback or Android device usage. However, when 3-device multipoint connectivity is unnecessary, Bose QuietComfort Earbuds offers basic functionality USD 36 cheaper. Consider alternatives for battery life and portability priorities. Recommended only for users committed to Technics brand sound philosophy and multi-device environment convenience. Business users frequently switching between multiple devices will realize this product's unique value proposition.
