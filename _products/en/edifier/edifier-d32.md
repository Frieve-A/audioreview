## Overview

The Edifier D32 is a tabletop wireless speaker featuring retro wooden design with modern connectivity options. Launched in 2024, it combines 60W RMS output power through a 2.1 acoustic architecture with dual 1-inch silk dome tweeters and a 4-inch mid-bass driver. The speaker supports Hi-Res Audio up to 24-bit/96kHz via multiple connectivity options including Bluetooth 5.3 with LDAC, WiFi with AirPlay2, USB-C, and analog inputs. With an 11-hour battery life and MDF cabinet construction, the D32 targets users seeking desktop audio with both wireless convenience and audiophile-grade codec support.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The D32's measurement data is limited to manufacturer specifications without independent third-party verification. Signal-to-noise ratio specification of ≥85dB (A) meets the sufficient level for speakers, where 80dB or above is considered adequate. Frequency response extends from 52Hz to 40kHz, covering well beyond the audible spectrum, though no deviation specifications (±dB) are provided for proper evaluation. Critical distortion measurements including harmonic distortion (THD), intermodulation distortion (IMD), and frequency response deviation are not available from credible independent sources. Hi-Res Audio certification supports 24-bit/96kHz formats, indicating capability for transparent digital audio reproduction. Without comprehensive third-party measurements, conservative evaluation applies, preventing higher scoring despite the Hi-Res certification and adequate signal-to-noise specification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Edifier demonstrates strong engineering foundation with in-house design capabilities across the entire production chain, including R&D, PCB design, transducer design and manufacture. The company invests approximately 8% of annual revenue in research and development, employing over 300 engineers dedicated to product advancement. The D32 incorporates contemporary technology including full digital signal processing, dual Texas Instruments Class D amplifiers, and active two-way crossover with Dynamic Range Control (DRC). Technology adoption is appropriate for the category, featuring modern connectivity standards (Bluetooth 5.3, dual-band WiFi, AirPlay2) and advanced audio codecs (LDAC, ALAC). While lacking breakthrough innovation or proprietary patent technology, the implementation represents solid engineering with rational technology choices for measurable performance improvement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 199.99 USD, the D32 offers Bluetooth 5.3 (including LDAC), dual-band WiFi with AirPlay2, USB-C audio input, analog input, active crossover, and 60W RMS output, meeting equivalence on user functions. Our comparison finds the Edifier ES300 (399.99 USD) with comparable connectivity and output but higher price; the JBL Authentics 200 (349.99 USD) lacks some functions; the Tribit StormBox Blast (199 USD) offers higher output but lacks network wireless features. We found no lower-priced product with equivalent-or-better functions and (based on available information) performance; therefore the CP score is set to 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Edifier provides 2-year warranty coverage for home speakers, meeting industry average standards. The company operates a global warranty system covering multiple regions with established support infrastructure through support@edifier.com. As a vertically integrated manufacturer with proven track record in audio equipment, Edifier maintains quality control throughout the production process from conception through final assembly. The D32's construction features MDF cabinet design and digital electronics with Class D amplifiers, representing standard robust design with fewer moving parts compared to analog alternatives. Support duration follows typical industry periods with standard warranty and parts supply arrangements. While lacking exceptional extended support programs or premium service features, the established brand reputation and comprehensive manufacturing control provide solid reliability foundation for long-term ownership.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Edifier adopts modern digital signal processing, Class D amplification, and contemporary connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3, WiFi, AirPlay2) that directly contribute to functional and measured performance. Cost allocation is directed to explainable improvements such as driver integration and output management (DRC/active crossover). The company avoids excessive material inputs and non-scientific assertions, focusing on user-benefiting, rational technology choices. Overall, the allocation of resources toward improvements verifiable by measurements is judged rational while maintaining a balance with practical reliability.

## Advice

The Edifier D32 represents excellent value for users requiring comprehensive desktop wireless connectivity with audiophile-grade codec support. The combination of Hi-Res Audio certification, LDAC Bluetooth, AirPlay2 WiFi, and multiple wired inputs makes it suitable for diverse source devices including smartphones, computers, and streaming services. The 60W RMS output and 2.1 acoustic architecture with active crossover provide adequate power for desktop listening environments. Prospective buyers should note the limited availability of independent measurement data, though manufacturer specifications suggest reasonable performance for the category. Users prioritizing maximum output power may consider alternatives, while those requiring true wireless stereo pairing should explore other options as the D32 operates as a single-unit solution. The 11-hour battery life and portable form factor suit both stationary desktop use and occasional mobility. Given the lack of equivalent-or-better alternatives at lower pricing, the D32 offers exceptional cost-performance for users seeking this specific combination of features and connectivity options.
