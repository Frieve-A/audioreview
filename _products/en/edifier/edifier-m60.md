## Overview

The Edifier M60 is a compact desktop speaker released in 2024, featuring 66W output (15W×2 for high frequencies, 18W×2 for mid-bass). It incorporates a 1-inch silk dome tweeter and 3-inch aluminum mid-bass driver, with Bluetooth 5.3 LDAC codec support, 24bit/96kHz high-resolution processing, and Texas Instruments Class D amplifier. It supports USB-C and AUX inputs, with customization available through the dedicated "Edifier ConneX" app. The product has won VGP2025 Gold Award and Cost Performance Award, attracting market attention.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Official specifications claim 58Hz-40kHz frequency response and 85dB(A) S/N ratio, but detailed third-party measurement data is insufficient, making actual performance verification impossible. The claimed 85dB S/N ratio falls significantly below the 105dB+ transparent level standard. The compact cabinet size (100×168×147mm) imposes severe physical limitations, particularly restricting low-frequency reproduction capability below 80Hz. While Hi-Res Audio certified, the certification relates to digital processing capability rather than acoustic performance, and actual audible performance improvement remains unverified without proper measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design utilizing Texas Instruments Class D amplifier and DSP is solid but remains at industry standard level. LDAC support is commendable, though implementation uses existing generic chipsets with limited uniqueness. The combination of 1-inch silk dome tweeter and 3-inch aluminum driver is conventional, with no notable technical innovations. While convenience features like touch panel and dedicated app support exist, their contribution to sound quality improvement is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Against the market price of 167 USD, the closest comparable product is the Edifier R1700BT (66W RMS, approximately 180 USD), which provides equivalent 66W RMS power output and similar connectivity options. Creative Pebble X offers only 15W RMS (30W peak), making it unsuitable for comparison due to significantly inferior power output. The M60 is the most cost-effective choice for comparable 66W RMS desktop speaker performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Basic quality as an Edifier brand product is maintained, but specific information about warranty periods and repair systems is limited. Support through domestic sales representatives is expected, though not at industry-leading levels. Firmware updates are provided through the dedicated "Edifier ConneX" app, but update frequency and coverage scope remain unclear.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The compact design specialized for desktop use is rational, but with higher-performance alternatives available at the same price point, the product's raison d'être becomes ambiguous. There's a significant gap between high-quality features like LDAC support and Hi-Res certification claims, and actual performance limitations due to physical constraints. The product fails to demonstrate clear advantages when compared to smartphone plus external DAC/amplifier combinations or more affordable dedicated speakers.

## Advice

While the Edifier M60 is indeed user-friendly with good design aesthetics as a desktop speaker, the 167 USD price point represents excellent value in a market with limited 66W RMS alternatives. The Creative Pebble X provides only 15W RMS output, making it unsuitable for users requiring the M60's 66W RMS power output. For equivalent power specifications, the Edifier R1700BT (66W RMS, approximately 180 USD) costs more than the M60, making the M60 the most cost-effective option for 66W RMS desktop speaker performance. For users requiring LDAC-compatible compact speakers with specifically 66W RMS output, the M60 represents the best value option available. However, the lack of comprehensive measurement data makes objective performance evaluation impossible, and potential buyers should consider whether the premium for unverified performance claims is justified without transparent measurement verification.
