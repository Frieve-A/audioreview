## Overview

The QS30 is a compact under-monitor soundbar supporting USB audio and Bluetooth 5.4. It uses dual 2" full-range drivers (5W RMS total) with independent cavities and bass-reflex ports, includes a built-in microphone, RGB lighting via TempoAbyss, and app control through Edifier ConneX/TempoHub for EQ, lighting, and firmware updates［1][2］.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Manufacturer specs indicate a **90Hz–18kHz** bandwidth with constrained extension, **5W RMS** total output suitable for near-field, and **S/N ≥ 85 dB(A)** typical for desktop use［2][4］. Wireless supports **Bluetooth 5.4 (SBC)**［1］. With no credible third-party measurements yet, we rate **0.3** based on these spec-level limitations that align with problem-level expectations.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Conventional small 2.0 design plus USB audio and BT 5.4 (SBC), complemented by app integration, RGB control, and a MEMS mic［1][2］. This meets baseline expectations without audio-centric innovation beyond the class standard.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Using **USD 63** for QS30 and selecting **Creative Pebble V3 (USD 44.99)** as the cheapest equal-or-better comparator—USB audio + Bluetooth present, and **8W RMS** vs **5W RMS**—the score is **0.7**［3][5］.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Edifier provides global product/support portals and companion apps［1］. Domestic listings indicate **1-year warranty** coverage［4］. Simple, low-stress USB-powered architecture supports a moderately positive 0.7.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product prioritizes compact placement and visual customization over maximizing measured audio transparency. Given the modest bandwidth and output, we assign a neutral 0.5.

## Advice

Choose the QS30 if you want a slim bar under your monitor with RGB, USB audio, BT, and a built-in mic. For more output and bandwidth at similar or lower cost, a compact 2.0 set like Creative Pebble V3 offers stronger value.
