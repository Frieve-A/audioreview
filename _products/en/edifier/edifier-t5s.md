## Overview

The Edifier T5S is a compact powered subwoofer featuring an 8-inch front-firing woofer with **70 W RMS** amplification. It’s intended for desktop and small-room setups, rated to **35–115 Hz**, and provides **DSP-based low-pass and 0°/180° phase controls** in a slim 18 mm MDF cabinet. The official US page lists an MSRP of **219.99 USD**. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Official specifications state **35–115 Hz**, **70 W (RMS)**, **S/N ≥ 85 dB(A)**, with adjustable low-pass and phase controls. These are reasonable for nearfield/desktop use, but we found **no independent third-party lab measurements specific to T5S** as of August 16, 2025. Pending reliable measurements (e.g., distortion, max SPL vs. frequency), the score remains at the baseline. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A conventional **Class-D** amplifier with basic DSP handles crossover/phase alignment. Materials and topology (18 mm MDF, slim sealed-style vertical cabinet) are standard for the price tier—competent but not notably advanced relative to peers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At **219.99 USD**, the T5S competes with **PreSonus Eris Sub 8BT** at **209.99 USD**. The Eris 8BT extends to **30 Hz**, offers **variable HPF/LPF**, and provides **balanced TRS + RCA** I/O (with Bluetooth). On user-facing functions and extension it is **equivalent-or-better** overall. **Calculation: 209.99 USD ÷ 219.99 USD = 0.95**, which rounds to **1.0** to one decimal place. [3][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Edifier states a **two-year warranty** for home speakers purchased via authorized US/Canada channels. Model-specific long-term reliability data for T5S remain limited, but construction and stated support are typical for this price. [5]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The product emphasizes a **slim, space-saving footprint** and easy system integration over maximum low-frequency headroom. DSP helps with integration; enclosure volume still limits ultimate output/extension compared with larger boxes.

## Advice

For desks and tight spaces, T5S is easy to place and integrate. If **deeper extension and studio-style controls** matter, the **PreSonus Eris Sub 8BT (209.99 USD)** is the stronger value. If you can accept a larger footprint and higher cost for **substantially more output and depth**, consider the **RSL Speedwoofer 10E (339 USD)**. [3][4][6]
