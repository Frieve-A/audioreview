summary: "A compact 3-way, tri-amped 5-inch active monitor pair with LDAC/Hi-Res Bluetooth and app tuning. Independent Klippel NFS spinorama/directivity data are available, enabling evidence-based assessment. Within the Bluetooth-capable, measurement-validated set, it is the lowest-priced option and thus achieves a top cost-performance score."

## Overview

The Edifier MR5 is a 5-inch active studio monitor sold as a stereo pair. It uses a **3-way tri-amped** topology (5" woofer, ~3.75" mid, 1" silk-dome tweeter) with a digital crossover and per-band Class-D amplification. Claimed specs include **46 Hz–40 kHz** frequency response, **110 W RMS** total output (pair), and **max SPL 101 dB @1 m**. Wireless features include **LDAC/Hi-Res Bluetooth** and an app for basic room/desk compensation. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent **Klippel NFS spinorama/directivity** data for the MR5 are publicly available, covering on-axis, listening window, early reflections, predicted in-room response (PIR) and directivity index (DI). Representative quantitative anchors derivable from the published curves include:

- **Low-frequency extension (–6 dB)**: **≈48 Hz** (from the LF extension point on the spinorama plot). [2]  
- **Listening-window flatness**: broadly smooth through midband with an identifiable **feature around ~4 kHz**; off-axis responses remain orderly, supporting a stable PIR. [2]

The presence of a complete spinorama set materially increases confidence versus spec-only evaluation. Public materials do not tabulate comprehensive level-indexed distortion/thermal compression data, so uncertainty remains around maximum clean output behavior. With standardized NFS data confirming extension and directivity, **0.7** is appropriate. [2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

For a 5-inch monitor, a **compact 3-way tri-amped** platform with **digital crossover** and **LDAC** is advanced relative to common 2-way peers. The architecture targets reduced excursion and cleaner crossover behavior while enabling directivity shaping. However, amplifier/DSP implementation details (limiters, internal processing rates, protection) are not fully disclosed; in the broader pro-monitor field this is competent but not state-of-the-art. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Comparator set definition (policy-conformant):** products that (1) are active stereo monitor pairs, (2) include **Bluetooth**, and (3) have **public third-party speaker measurements** of comparable scope (spinorama/directivity) so they do **not underperform** on functionality or objective assessment quality.

- **Cheapest valid comparator found:** *IK Multimedia iLoud Micro Monitor* — **Bluetooth** present; independent measurements published; widely available at **USD 299**. [3]  
- **Subject price:** **USD 270** (pair).

Because the MR5 is **less expensive** than the cheapest comparator that does not underperform on functionality and measurement availability, it is the **lowest-priced option in the valid set**. Per policy, that yields the maximum cost-performance score:

CP = 1.0

*(Note: Bluetooth monitors like Pioneer DJ DM-50D-BT are cheaper but lack a comparable public spinorama/directivity set; they therefore do not meet the comparator set requirements for this criterion.)* [4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Edifier is a long-standing, publicly listed manufacturer (SZSE: 002351) with global distribution and app support. Standard regional warranties and service channels apply. Model-specific long-term failure data for MR5 are not yet available; considering brand scale and footprint but limited MR5-specific statistics, a **near-industry-average** estimate is warranted. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design prioritizes nearfield practicality: **band-split via 3-way crossover** and tri-amping for control, plus **Bluetooth/LDAC and app-based convenience**. Trade-offs are clear: added complexity and bill-of-materials versus simpler wired 2-way monitors that may suit strictly wired studio workflows. The choices are coherent and user-oriented but not disruptive to price/performance norms, hence **0.5**. [1][2]

## Advice

For users who need **Bluetooth plus measurement-backed performance**, the MR5 is compelling at its price: independent NFS data indicate extension to **≈48 Hz (–6 dB)** and well-behaved directivity with a small ~4 kHz feature, aiding predictable in-room tonality. If Bluetooth is unnecessary, wired-only 2-way monitors remain cost-saving alternatives.
