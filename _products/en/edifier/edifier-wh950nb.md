## Overview

The Edifier WH950NB are wireless over-ear headphones aimed at the budget ANC segment. They feature 40 mm titanium-coated drivers, Bluetooth 5.3 with LDAC, and a long 55-hour battery life (34 h with ANC; manufacturer spec) alongside hybrid active noise cancelling, Hi-Res Audio certification, multipoint, and app EQ [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent measurements report notable frequency-response deviations: an **enormous peak around 4.5 kHz** that can make vocals sound forward or “shouty,” plus an additional **treble peak near 8.5 kHz**; the midrange dips after ~2 kHz accentuate these peaks [1]. On the noise-control side, measured **passive isolation averages 23.15 dBA** and **ANC averages 28.41 dBA** reduction (A-weighted per IEC 61672:2003), with >40 dB reduction at parts of the treble and strong low-frequency attenuation in High ANC mode [1]. Manufacturer battery specs (55 h; **34 h with ANC**) are included for context [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The WH950NB package standard mid-range tech: 40 mm dynamic drivers with conventional DSP/EQ, hybrid (feedforward/feedback) ANC, Bluetooth 5.3 with LDAC, and efficient power management for long runtime. It’s competent, but doesn’t push the state of the art in drive-unit design, acoustic architecture, or DSP beyond class norms.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

At **149 USD** market price, there are cheaper models with **equivalent or better user-visible features** and **solid measured performance**. The **Soundcore Space Q45** supports **LDAC**, offers a robust app with multi-level/adaptive ANC, and is widely reported to block noise effectively across the spectrum; manufacturer battery life with ANC is **50 h** (vs 34 h for WH950NB) [3][4][5]. Current new-unit pricing as low as **99.99 USD** is available from major retailers [3].  

**CP calculation:** 99.99 USD ÷ 149 USD = **0.671… → 0.7**.

*(Equivalence note: LDAC + hybrid/adaptive ANC + app EQ; ANC effectiveness and battery life are comparable or better on Q45 per third-party testing and manufacturer specs [4][5].)*

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Edifier provides a standard one-year warranty and routine firmware updates via the app. Long-term failure-rate data for this specific model isn’t broadly published. Support coverage and ecosystem feel typical for this price class.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While WH950NB’s feature set is modern (LDAC, multipoint, long battery), the measured FR peaks and irregular treble response work against transparent reproduction [1]. Emphasis appears placed on convenience and stamina over neutral tonality. The approach is practical, but not strongly aligned with measurement-driven fidelity goals.

## Advice

Choose the WH950NB if you value **very long battery life**, **LDAC**, and **strong ANC** in a travel-friendly package. If **value** is paramount, the **Soundcore Space Q45** delivers similar features—including LDAC—and longer ANC-on battery at a much lower price [3][4]. If you prioritize a **more neutral tuning**, plan to use EQ or consider models with flatter measured FR.
