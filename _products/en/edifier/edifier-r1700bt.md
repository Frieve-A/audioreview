## Overview

The Edifier R1700BT are 2.0 powered Bluetooth bookshelf speakers (pair) with 4-inch mid-bass drivers, 19 mm silk-dome tweeters, and a rated 66 W RMS total output. The system integrates Class-D amplification with DSP/DRC, dual RCA analog inputs, and Bluetooth 5.1 in MDF enclosures angled 10° toward the listener [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

No full standardized third-party loudspeaker measurements (spin/orb, DI, THD vs SPL) were found for this exact model. Manufacturer specifications list frequency response at **60 Hz–20 kHz**, SNR **≥85 dB(A)**, and total output **66 W RMS** [1]. The limited low-frequency extension (no sub-bass under 60 Hz) materially departs from transparency goals; off-axis and distortion performance remain unverified by independent labs. Scoring starts from 0.5 for “unknown full measurement set” and is adjusted −0.1 for restricted bandwidth, yielding **0.4**. Key numbers are taken as manufacturer specs [1][5].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The implementation is industry-standard and current: Class-D amplification with DSP/DRC, Bluetooth **5.1**, remote control, and dual RCA inputs in MDF cabinets. There is no evidence of proprietary acoustical innovations or advanced integration beyond the mainstream for this class [1][5].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better, current product):** **Edifier R1280DB** at **189.99 USD** (Edifier USA). **Equivalence note:** Adds **optical/coaxial digital inputs**, specifies **55 Hz–20 kHz** FR and **≥85 dB(A)** SNR, and lists Bluetooth **5.1**—thus equal-or-better functions and not inferior basic performance [2][3].  

**CP calculation:** 189.99 USD ÷ 219.99 USD = **0.86 → 0.9** (capped/rounded per rule). Target price source: Edifier USA **219.99 USD**; cross-checked via Edifier Online Store listing [1][6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Edifier North America states a **2-year** limited warranty for home speakers purchased via authorized channels; headphones are 1 year. Support is primarily through Edifier NA/authorized providers [4]. The straightforward Class-D architecture at modest power tends to be robust; no special extended support systems are advertised.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Starting from a neutral **0.5** baseline:  
- **−0.1 (Conservative approach / performance progression):** Compared with Edifier’s own R1280DB, the R1700BT omits digital inputs and has shallower stated bass extension (60 Hz vs 55 Hz) without compensating measurable advances [1][3].  
- **−0.1 (Cost allocation vs audibility):** Emphasis on wooden aesthetics and convenience over user-facing, measurable acoustic performance (e.g., no documented off-axis/THD improvements) indicates costs not directly tied to audible transparency [1].  

Net **0.3**. No occult/unsupported claims are promoted.

## Advice

If you need TV/PC digital hookup without an external DAC, the **R1280DB** is strictly more versatile for less money [2][3]. For fuller bass or higher output, step up in driver size or add a subwoofer; truly transparent reproduction requires independently characterized directivity and distortion. For casual nearfield listening where Bluetooth is essential, the R1700BT remains serviceable.
