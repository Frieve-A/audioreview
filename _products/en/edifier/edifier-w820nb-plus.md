## Overview

The Edifier W820NB Plus is a wireless over-ear noise cancelling headphone positioned in the competitive under-100 USD market segment. Featuring Hi-Res Audio certification, 40mm titanium composite diaphragm drivers, and hybrid active noise cancellation up to -43dB, the product targets budget-conscious consumers seeking premium features. The headphone supports Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity with LDAC codec, offers extended 33-hour battery life with ANC enabled, and weighs 238g. Priced at 79.99 USD, it competes directly with established budget ANC offerings while providing contemporary features like app-based customization and gaming mode with 0.08s latency.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. The manufacturer specifies frequency response of 20Hz-40kHz and sound pressure level of 91±3dB(A), with 32-ohm impedance confirmed by independent testing [1]. Active noise cancellation performance of up to -43dB exceeds the excellent threshold for headphones (30dB+). However, essential measurements including THD, S/N ratio, and specific frequency response deviation remain unspecified by the manufacturer, preventing comprehensive performance evaluation according to transparency criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product demonstrates contemporary technology integration with some recent advances. Key features include 40mm dynamic drivers with titanium composite diaphragm, Bluetooth 5.2 with LDAC and SBC codec support, and hybrid ANC technology. Notable contemporary additions include DNN (deep neural network) noise cancellation for call quality enhancement and gaming mode with 0.08s low latency [3]. Hi-Res Audio certification ensures industry standard compliance, while the Edifier Connect app provides standard customization functionality. The technology stack represents in-house design with appropriate adoption of current-generation features, though it lacks breakthrough innovation or proprietary technologies that would provide significant competitive differentiation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The Edifier W820NB Plus at 79.99 USD is the world's cheapest product with equivalent-or-better user-facing functionality and measured performance. The product features DNN (deep neural network) noise cancellation for call quality enhancement and gaming mode with 0.08s low latency, which are not available in competing products at equivalent or lower prices. No cheaper alternative exists that provides equivalent-or-better functionality including these advanced features.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Edifier provides one-year limited warranty coverage for headphones in North America when purchased from authorized retailers, covering defects in materials or workmanship under normal use conditions [5]. The company maintains global manufacturer support infrastructure with structured RMA processes and regional coverage. Support excludes physical damages not attributable to product quality, unauthorized modifications, and natural wear. The company demonstrates commitment to development and maintains in-house R&D, PCB design, and transducer manufacturing capabilities. While warranty duration is below industry standard for premium products, the global support system and established manufacturing track record provide reasonable confidence in product reliability and service availability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Edifier demonstrates rational focus on scientifically verifiable improvements through Hi-Res Audio certification supporting measurable high-resolution audio formats and LDAC codec adoption for quantifiable audio quality enhancement. The company shows commitment to functional development rather than marketing-driven features through in-house R&D, PCB design, and transducer manufacturing capabilities. Design approach emphasizes cost-effectiveness with features like ANC, LDAC support, and app integration directly contributing to user functionality. Technology adoption includes contemporary standards like Bluetooth 5.2 and DNN call processing, representing appropriate integration of cutting-edge features. However, the approach remains evolutionary rather than revolutionary, following established active headphone design patterns without breakthrough innovation that would significantly advance the category.

## Advice

For budget-conscious consumers seeking ANC headphones under 100 USD, the W820NB Plus offers competitive features including Hi-Res Audio certification, LDAC codec support, and respectable 43dB noise cancellation. The 33-hour battery life with ANC provides practical advantage for daily use. The product's DNN noise cancellation for call quality enhancement and 0.08s low-latency gaming mode represent advanced features not commonly available in this price segment. The W820NB Plus is the world's cheapest product with equivalent-or-better functionality including these advanced features, making it an excellent value proposition for users seeking premium features at an affordable price point.
