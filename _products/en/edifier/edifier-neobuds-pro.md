## Overview

The Edifier NeoBuds Pro 2 is a true wireless earphone launched in 2023 that won the VGP2024 Gold Award. It features a hybrid configuration combining dynamic drivers with Knowles balanced armature drivers. The earphones offer up to 50dB of active noise cancellation through EDIFIER WIDE-BAND MULTI-CHANNEL ANC technology, support for LDAC and LHDC high-quality codecs, and Hi-Res Audio certification, delivering high-end features at 133 USD. Additional practical features include 360-degree spatial audio, IP54 water resistance, and up to 22 hours of continuous playback.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Measured data reveals severe frequency response problems including a significant 12kHz peak requiring 13dB correction to achieve flat response. This level of deviation far exceeds the ±0.5dB transparency threshold and the ±3dB problem level for headphones. The claimed 50dB ANC performance contradicts actual measurements showing maximum attenuation of 38dB. While the hybrid configuration claims 20Hz-40kHz reproduction capability, the massive frequency response distortion negates any potential benefits. The scientific effectiveness is severely compromised by these documented measurement issues.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The combination of dynamic drivers and Knowles BA drivers with digital crossover represents above-average industry standards. The EDIFIER WIDE-BAND MULTI-CHANNEL ANC technology is technically comprehensive, though actual performance falls short of claimed specifications. Technical implementations including LDAC and LHDC codec support, Hi-Res Audio certification, and 360-degree spatial audio are well-implemented. However, the severe frequency response tuning failures indicate fundamental engineering problems that undermine the advanced technology, resulting in below-average technical execution.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Edifier NeoBuds Pro 2 is priced at 133 USD, but the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC with equivalent or superior features is available for 67 USD. The Liberty 4 NC similarly features LDAC support, ANC functionality, and long battery life, allowing direct functional comparison. However, the NeoBuds Pro 2's 50dB ANC performance exceeds that of the Liberty 4 NC, and this difference must be considered. CP = MIN(1.0, 67 USD ÷ 133 USD) = 0.50, rounded to 0.5. Considering the differentiation factor of 50dB ANC performance, the cost performance is at an average level.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Edifier is established as a global audio brand with quality control above industry standards. The official sales network in the Japanese market, adequate warranty period, and firmware update support through the app demonstrate a well-structured support system. The IP54 water resistance and robust housing design provide sufficient durability for daily use. However, long-term failure rate data is limited, preventing it from reaching the highest level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The adoption of hybrid driver configuration and digital crossover is technically rational, but the actual sound quality tuning is severely problematic. The massive 12kHz peak requiring 13dB correction represents a fundamental tuning failure that contradicts the Hi-Res Audio certification purpose. This level of frequency response distortion indicates poor engineering judgment and quality control failures. While prioritizing ANC performance is rational, the inability to achieve basic frequency response accuracy undermines the product's core function. The design philosophy shows significant irrationality in execution.

## Advice

The Edifier NeoBuds Pro 2 cannot be recommended due to severe frequency response issues that fundamentally compromise sound quality. The 12kHz peak requiring 13dB correction makes this product unsuitable for critical listening despite its advanced codec support. While the ANC performance is advertised as 50dB, actual measurements show 38dB maximum, indicating marketing claims exceed actual performance. Users seeking quality audio reproduction should avoid this product due to its documented measurement failures. The VGP2024 Gold Award appears inconsistent with the actual measured performance of this product.
