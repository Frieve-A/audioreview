## Overview

The Edifier MR4 is an entry-level active studio monitor developed by Chinese audio equipment manufacturer Edifier. It features a 4-inch woofer and 1-inch silk dome tweeter with 42W (21W×2) output in a 2-way design. Priced around 115 USD, it includes monitor mode and music mode switching functionality, designed for home studios and small production environments. The MDF cabinet construction suppresses resonance, and it is equipped with balanced XLR/TRS inputs and RCA inputs.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

According to measurement data, THD+N is below 0.2%, and the system's overall S/N ratio is specified as ≥85dB(A) with SNR up to 99dB under specific measurement conditions according to official specifications, but these figures do not reach transparent levels. The particular issue is frequency response, which is limited to the 60Hz-20kHz range and does not fully cover the human audible range of 20Hz-20kHz. The lack of sub-bass reproduction capability below 60Hz makes accurate low-frequency reproduction difficult. THD+N of 0.2% is a standard level for speakers, but it falls significantly short of the transparent level of 0.01%. Based on these measurement results, the audible improvement effects are judged to be limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design employs TI's digital amplifier TAS5713, and the combination of 4-inch woofer and 1-inch silk dome tweeter represents industry-standard design. The resonance suppression through MDF cabinet construction and the monitor/music mode switching functionality are practical technical implementations. However, these technologies are combinations of existing designs, with limited originality and innovation. The adoption of Class D amplification circuits is modern, but does not significantly contribute to measurement performance improvement. Overall, this can be evaluated as industry-average technical level, though it does not reach the highest standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The MR4 is priced at approximately 115 USD in the current market. To evaluate its cost-performance, it is necessary to find the cheapest alternative among active studio monitors with equivalent or superior basic performance, specifically those equipped with a 4-inch woofer. Based on market research as of 2025, the MR4 is effectively one of the most affordable options in this category. Cheaper products typically have smaller woofers or are otherwise inferior in basic performance, making them unsuitable for comparison. Since no cheaper alternative with comparable performance can be found, the cost-performance is rated 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Edifier maintains consistent product quality and warranty systems as a globally expanding audio equipment manufacturer. They provide standard warranty periods and repair support, with easy product availability through global distribution networks. However, they do not offer industry-leading warranty periods or special support systems, and there are no notable advantages in reliability. Detailed data on product failure rates and long-term durability are not publicly available, but standard reliability can be expected under normal usage conditions.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design as an entry-level studio monitor is fundamentally rational, but has several limitations. The limitation of sub-bass reproduction capability below 60Hz can be understood as a physical constraint of small speakers, but it affects accurate acoustic monitoring. The monitor mode and music mode switching functionality is practical, but considering the original purpose as a studio monitor, maintaining flat characteristics is important. The adoption of MDF cabinet construction and appropriate input terminal placement are rational design decisions. However, considering that products with superior measurement performance exist in the same price range, the rationality of the design philosophy is evaluated as moderate.

## Advice

When considering purchasing the MR4, it is important to first clarify the intended use. For serious music production or accurate monitoring requirements, the limitations of sub-bass reproduction capability below 60Hz and the THD+N figure of 0.2% may pose constraints. As alternatives, comparison with other entry-level studio monitors with equivalent basic functions is necessary. Additionally, if the budget can be extended to around 150 USD, higher-performance options can also be considered. The advantages of choosing the MR4 are the slightly superior low-frequency reproduction capability through the 4-inch driver and mode switching functionality, but whether these added values justify the price difference depends on individual usage. For beginner home studio applications, it provides sufficient performance, but for those aiming for higher levels of music production, consideration of higher-end models is recommended.
