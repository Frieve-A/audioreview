## Overview

The Edifier S300 is a premium tabletop Bluetooth speaker that combines retro aesthetics with advanced wireless connectivity. Launched in 2025, it features 80W RMS output power through a configuration of dual 1.25-inch titanium dome tweeters and a 5.5-inch aluminum diaphragm mid-bass driver. The speaker stands out for its dual wireless protocol support, offering both Bluetooth 5.4 with LDAC codec and Apple AirPlay 2 connectivity. With Hi-Res Audio and Hi-Res Audio Wireless certification, the S300 targets audiophiles seeking high-quality wireless audio reproduction. The MDF enclosure design incorporates digital signal processing and two-way active crossover, positioning it as a premium desktop audio solution.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The S300's scientific validity evaluation is limited by conflicting manufacturer specifications and absence of credible third-party measurements. Official specifications list frequency response as 48Hz-40kHz, which represents good extension, but no deviation measurements (±dB) are provided to assess actual performance. Signal-to-noise ratio specifications show discrepancy between official Edifier documentation stating ≥85dB(A) [1][2] and third-party sources claiming 110dB(A) [3]. The official manufacturer specifications from Edifier's global and US websites are considered more credible, suggesting actual S/N performance of ≥85dB(A). The 80W RMS output appears adequate for intended desktop use, supported by TI TAS5822M digital amplifier chips. However, critical measurements including harmonic distortion (THD), intermodulation distortion (IMD), and crosstalk data are unavailable. The 24-bit/96kHz digital signal processing represents contemporary standards, but without independent verification of implementation quality. Due to insufficient measurement data for proper scientific evaluation, this receives the framework's default score for unmeasurable products.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The S300 demonstrates solid contemporary technology adoption with several notable implementations. Bluetooth 5.4 represents current-generation wireless connectivity, while LDAC codec support enables high-quality wireless transmission. The integration of Apple AirPlay 2 alongside LDAC creates broad compatibility across both Android and iOS ecosystems, demonstrating thoughtful technology selection. The dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz/5GHz) implementation supports AirPlay 2's requirements effectively. TI TAS5822M digital amplifier chips represent established, reliable technology rather than cutting-edge innovation. The combination of titanium dome tweeters with neodymium magnets and aluminum diaphragm drivers shows appropriate material selection. End-to-end 24-bit/96kHz digital signal processing with analog-to-digital conversion maintains signal integrity. While the technology implementation is competent and contemporary, it primarily uses established components rather than proprietary innovations, limiting advancement beyond industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 240 USD, the S300 represents the world's cheapest product with equivalent-or-better performance, featuring 48Hz-40kHz frequency response, 80W RMS output, S/N ratio ≥85dB(A), and both LDAC and AirPlay 2 connectivity protocols. Investigation revealed no products meeting all these specifications while being available for less than 240 USD. The Anker Soundcore Motion X600 at 199.99 USD offers LDAC support but lacks AirPlay 2, making it functionally incomplete for users requiring both Android (LDAC) and Apple (AirPlay 2) ecosystem compatibility. This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The S300 provides excellent cost-performance value as the world's cheapest product with equivalent-or-better performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Edifier provides standard industry support with a 2-year warranty for home speakers, meeting typical consumer expectations. The company's 28-year history since founding in 1996 demonstrates sustained market presence and accumulated expertise in audio equipment manufacturing. The MDF enclosure construction suggests robust design resistant to resonance and distortion, contributing to long-term reliability. Support infrastructure includes manufacturer-direct service through email (support@edifier.com) and phone (1-877-EDIFIER), providing multiple contact options. Warranty terms cover defects in materials and workmanship, with repair or replacement services using new or refurbished components. The relatively simple electronic design utilizing established TI amplifier chips should contribute to reliability, as digital amplification typically exhibits fewer failure modes than complex analog circuitry. Global warranty policies vary by region, with customers directed to local service centers for support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Edifier demonstrates rational design philosophy emphasizing technological excellence and functional integration. The focus on digital signal processing and measurement-based design aligns with scientific audio development principles. Integration of both LDAC and AirPlay 2 protocols shows practical recognition of market requirements rather than platform exclusivity. The adoption of contemporary wireless technologies (Bluetooth 5.4, dual-band Wi-Fi) and digital amplification represents forward-thinking approaches to audio reproduction. The company's stated commitment to "technological excellence" and "functional simplicity" reflects rational priorities emphasizing performance over marketing superficialities. Use of established components like TI amplifier chips demonstrates cost-effective engineering rather than expensive proprietary solutions that may not improve actual performance. The Hi-Res Audio certification pursuit indicates commitment to measurable audio quality standards. However, the emphasis on "unique sensory and emotional products" alongside technical specifications suggests some consideration of subjective factors beyond pure measurement optimization.

## Advice

The Edifier S300 offers comprehensive wireless protocol support combining both LDAC and AirPlay 2 connectivity with 80W RMS output power at 240 USD. The speaker's dual-protocol advantage makes it valuable for mixed-device households or users frequently switching between Android and iOS devices. The Anker Soundcore Motion X600 at 199.99 USD provides LDAC support only, suitable for Android-only users but inadequate for Apple device integration. Detailed measurement data remains unavailable, limiting scientific performance verification. The S300 suits users prioritizing maximum wireless protocol compatibility as the world's cheapest product with equivalent-or-better performance. With 48Hz-40kHz frequency response, 80W RMS output, and S/N ratio ≥85dB(A), it provides excellent cost-performance value for users seeking comprehensive wireless connectivity.
