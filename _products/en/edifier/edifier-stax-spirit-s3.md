## Overview

The Edifier STAX Spirit S3 represents a mature wireless planar-magnetic implementation. It uses 89×70 mm planar drivers with EqualMass™ diaphragm technology and Snapdragon Sound–enabled Bluetooth 5.2 with multipoint. Rated battery life is 80 h; weight is 329 g; rated response is 20 Hz–40 kHz.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent measurements (GRAS 43AG/RA0402 with KB5000/KB5001; Audiomatica Clio 12 QC) show very low distortion, typical closed-back isolation, ~215 ms Bluetooth latency (aptX path, MEE Connect), and ~6.6 kΩ effective impedance in powered-analog mode; ~28 ms internal-DSP latency is present even wired. A left/right level mismatch was observed on the measured unit. Battery testing elsewhere reported **93 h 2 m**. Manufacturer literature cites Uniforce™ diaphragm distortion around **0.5%**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

EqualMass™ integrates licensed Audeze technologies (Fluxor™, Fazor™, Uniforce™). Wireless stack: Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX Adaptive/aptX HD/aptX/SBC under Snapdragon Sound; aptX Voice supports 32 kHz call quality. Pad options with in-app pad compensation and a low-latency “gaming mode” indicate an engineering-first design among wireless planars.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

At **379.99 USD**, S3 competes with **Audeze Maxwell** at **299–329 USD** (official; min **299 USD**). Maxwell offers equal-or-greater capability: 90 mm planar drivers, >80 h battery, Bluetooth 5.3 with **LE Audio/LC3plus/LDAC**, and high-resolution up to **24-bit/96 kHz** over its wireless/USB paths. With comparable or superior functionality at a lower official entry price, the price ratio **299 / 379.99 ≈ 0.79** (→ **0.8**) reduces S3's value.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Warranty reference: headphones **12 months** (region-dependent). Documented issues include unreliable power-off behavior of the multifunction button, earpad-selection not working on iOS in the app, and no audio while charging (no USB audio pass-through). Wired listening still requires power.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Resource allocation favors driver physics and wireless signal integrity (Audeze-licensed components, measurement-coherent tuning, Snapdragon Sound) over ancillary features—consistent with a measurement-driven design.

## Advice

Choose S3 for wireless planar performance with measurement-backed tuning if you can accept the control/app limitations. For price-to-capability, Audeze Maxwell undercuts S3 while matching or exceeding functionality.
