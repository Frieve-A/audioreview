## Overview

The Edifier S880DB MKII represents a comprehensive upgrade from the original S880DB, featuring enhanced drivers, improved digital processing, and modern connectivity options while maintaining the compact bookshelf speaker format. This 2.0 active Hi-Fi speaker system incorporates a 1.25-inch titanium dome tweeter (upgraded from 1 inch) with 25mm voice coil, a 3.75-inch redesigned aluminum alloy mid-bass driver, and delivers 88 watts RMS total output power. The system supports Hi-Res Audio certification with 24bit/96kHz analog processing and up to 24bit/192kHz digital resolution, while offering comprehensive connectivity including USB-C, optical, coaxial, dual RCA inputs, and Bluetooth 5.3 with LDAC codec support.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity assessment relies on available manufacturer specifications due to absence of credible third-party measurement data. Frequency response extends 50Hz-20kHz (improved from original 55Hz-20kHz). Signal-to-noise ratio specifications are not disclosed by manufacturer for the MKII model. The system achieves Hi-Res Audio certification supporting 24bit/96kHz analog and up to 24bit/192kHz digital resolution. Total harmonic distortion specifications are not disclosed by manufacturer. Without verified technical specifications or independent measurements, and applying conservative evaluation guidelines for products relying solely on manufacturer claims, the scientific validity remains uncertain.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The S880DB MKII demonstrates solid technical implementation with contemporary technologies including high-performance XMOS XU216 processor (2,000 MIPS computational power) and Texas Instruments chipsets for advanced digital audio processing. Technology integration appropriately combines digital processing capabilities with comprehensive connectivity options (USB-C, optical, coaxial, Bluetooth 5.3 with LDAC). Edifier implemented proprietary driver improvements including upgraded tweeter size and redesigned mid-bass drivers. Current-generation technologies like Bluetooth 5.3 and LDAC codec reflect contemporary implementation. However, the system relies on standard industry chipsets without breakthrough proprietary patent technology, limiting technical differentiation from competitors.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

At 399.99 USD, the S880DB MKII provides 88W RMS power, USB-C connectivity, OLED display, Bluetooth 5.3 with LDAC codec, and comprehensive digital/analog inputs. The Edifier MR5 at 349.99 USD provides equivalent-or-better functionality with 110W RMS tri-amped system, USB-C connectivity, Bluetooth 6.0 with LDAC support, XLR/TRS/RCA inputs, and Hi-Res Audio certification. Equipped with equivalent modern connectivity (USB-C, LDAC), superior power output (110W vs 88W), and equivalent Hi-Res Audio capabilities. CP = 349.99 USD รท 399.99 USD = 0.9

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The S880DB MKII follows standard industry reliability and support practices with a 2-year warranty period covering defects in materials and workmanship. Active speaker design presents moderate complexity with neither exceptional robustness nor particular failure susceptibility. Edifier provides global manufacturer support through established dealer networks with standard repair processes for warranty-covered defects. As a recent release, long-term reliability data remains limited, though Edifier maintains an established presence in the audio market. Overall reliability and support represent average levels typical of consumer active speakers in this price category without exceptional advantages or disadvantages.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The S880DB MKII demonstrates rational design philosophy focused on measurable improvements and functional integration. Hi-Res Audio certification supports scientifically verifiable high-resolution audio formats (24bit/192kHz), while comprehensive connectivity and digital processing capabilities contribute directly to functional performance. Advanced integration including OLED display, wireless remote, and smartphone app control addresses modern user requirements. Contemporary technology adoption (XMOS processor, Bluetooth 5.3, LDAC) provides measurable performance contributions. The MKII shows clear progression over the original S880DB with improved frequency response (50Hz vs 55Hz), enhanced tweeter specifications, and expanded wireless capabilities. However, the approach represents evolutionary rather than revolutionary advancement, following established active speaker design patterns without breakthrough innovation.

## Advice

The Edifier S880DB MKII targets users seeking Hi-Res Audio certified active bookshelf speakers with comprehensive modern connectivity at an accessible price point. The system particularly suits desktop setups, small to medium rooms, and applications requiring multiple input options including USB-C and high-quality Bluetooth LDAC streaming. Prospective buyers should consider that while manufacturer specifications suggest competent performance, the absence of independent third-party measurements creates uncertainty about actual acoustic performance compared to measured alternatives. The 88W power output and 50Hz low-frequency extension may limit suitability for large rooms or bass-heavy applications without external subwoofer supplementation. Users prioritizing verified acoustic performance should await independent measurements or consider alternatives with published third-party test results.
