## Overview

The Tempotec Sonata BHD Pro is a compact USB-C dongle DAC/amp built around dual Cirrus Logic CS43131 DACs with both 4.4 mm balanced and 3.5 mm single-ended outputs. It supports PCM up to 32-bit/384 kHz, DSD256, and (per manufacturer) up to 8× MQA rendering. It targets users who want near-desktop transparency in a pocketable form, and enough output for most IEMs and many portable headphones.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio Science Review measured the Sonata BHD Pro with a **balanced SINAD of ~105 dB**, placing it within transparent territory for a portable DAC. Load-independent linearity and noise are competitive, and output levels meet common 2 Vrms (3.5 mm) / 4 Vrms (4.4 mm) norms for dongles [1]. Manufacturer specs list **THD+N 0.00012 %** and **SNR 131 dB**, and **4.4 mm power up to 280 mW @32 Ω** (catalog values) [2]. Together these indicate audibly transparent conversion with adequate headroom for typical IEMs and many efficient over-ears.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design uses a contemporary dual-CS43131 architecture with asynchronous USB, an FPGA for clock/data handling, and **three oscillators** to minimize jitter (per manufacturer). Balanced topology, hardware controls, and indicator LEDs are well-implemented but not unique in 2024–2025; overall sophistication is solid rather than novel [2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Review target price:** 70 USD.  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative found:** **Moondrop Dawn Pro** with **both 3.5 mm & 4.4 mm**, 2/4 Vrms line levels, and similarly low THD+N (catalog **0.00014 %**) at **50.99 USD** street price [3][4].  
**Equivalence note:** Same user-facing outputs (3.5 mm + 4.4 mm) and comparable measured specs (Vrms, THD+N/SNR class).  
**Calculation:** 50.99 USD ÷ 70 USD = **0.728… → 0.7** (rounded to first decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Tempotec provides a **12-month** warranty for DAC/AMP products [5]. Build is simple (no moving parts) and third-party distribution is broad, but extended support/firmware expectations are minimal for this category. Overall, average reliability/support with standard coverage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Engineering choices (dual CS43131, proper output stages, balanced topology) target measurable fidelity and practical drive capability. The emphasis is on transparent conversion and sufficient power rather than cosmetic add-ons. Claimed high-res/MQA support does not itself guarantee audible benefits, but does not detract from the core, measurement-driven design.

## Advice

If you need **both 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm** in one dongle with transparent conversion and enough power for IEMs and many portable headphones, the BHD Pro is a safe recommendation. If price sensitivity is high and you don’t need extras beyond dual outputs and clean measurements, **Moondrop Dawn Pro** offers equivalent functionality at a lower price; if you need screens or DSP, look to higher-feature models (often at higher prices).
