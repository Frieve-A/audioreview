## Overview

Volumio Preciso is a standalone dual-mono DAC from Italy’s Volumio. It uses two ESS ES9039Q2M chips in a mirrored dual-mono layout, offers balanced XLR (4 Vrms) and RCA (2 Vrms) outputs, supports up to PCM 768kHz/32-bit and DSD512, adds a hardware gain control (0.0 to −99.0 dB in 0.5 dB steps), and includes a NOS mode. List price is 899 USD. These are manufacturer specifications. [1] The ES9039Q2M itself is specified at 130 dB DNR and −120 dB THD+N per channel. [2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent third-party lab measurements of Preciso were not found at the time of writing. Volumio specifies THD+N of −122.5 dB, high-rate format support (PCM 768kHz/32-bit, DSD512), balanced 4 Vrms and unbalanced 2 Vrms outputs, and NOS mode. [1] A major retailer further lists S/N ratio of 128 dB (manufacturer data). [5] If achieved in the finished product, these figures are within transparent thresholds for DACs; in the absence of independent data we treat them as provisional and set Scientific Validity to 0.8.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design combines dual ES9039Q2M in true dual-mono topology, a single high-accuracy MEMS clock driving both DACs, dual internal linear power supplies (separate analog/digital regulation), a dedicated ASIC USB interface, NOS mode, and integrated hardware gain control usable as a basic preamp. [1] The core converter (ES9039Q2M, HyperStream IV) is a current-generation device specified at 130 dB DNR/−120 dB THD+N per channel. [2] This is modern and above commodity single-chip layouts, though not groundbreaking.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Cheapest equivalent-or-better option (global market): **Topping DX5 II** at **299 USD**. It uses **dual ES9039Q2M**, supports **PCM 768kHz/32-bit and DSD512**, and the manufacturer publishes **THD+N < 0.00006% (A-wt)** and **SNR/DNR 133 dB**—equal-or-better on-paper performance; it also adds a powerful headphone amp and Bluetooth. [3][4]  
**CP calculation (USD):** 299 USD ÷ 899 USD = **0.33** → **0.3** (rounded to one decimal). [3][1]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Warranty is listed as 12 months via a major retailer. [5] Volumio provides help resources and a community forum; Preciso is externally powered (5V/2A) with internal linear regulation, a sensible, serviceable approach. No long-term failure-rate data is available.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The engineering focus—dual-mono architecture, precise MEMS clocking, clean power, and transparency-oriented specs (−122.5 dB THD+N)—is rational and measurement-oriented. [1][2] However, when products with effectively equivalent user-facing performance exist at one-third the price, pricing undermines overall rationality for most buyers.

## Advice

Preciso suits buyers who want a dedicated, minimalist DAC with balanced outputs, NOS mode, and an integrated hardware gain control, and who value the brand’s industrial design. If your goal is transparent conversion at the lowest cost, the **Topping DX5 II (299 USD)** delivers the same core functions (and more) with equal-or-better catalog performance, so it is the rational choice on value. [3][4] If independent measurements later confirm Preciso exceeding peers, this recommendation may change; for now it is a luxury-leaning purchase.
