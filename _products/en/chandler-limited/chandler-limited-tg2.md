## Overview

The Chandler Limited TG2 is a faithful recreation of the rare EMI TG12428 preamp used in EMI/Abbey Road recording consoles from the late 1960s to early 1970s. It brings back the historic sound used in countless legendary recordings including The Beatles' Abbey Road album and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. Through discrete transformer-based circuitry and strict reproduction based on original schematics, it achieves the distinctive creamy, smooth tone characteristic of that era.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comprehensive manufacturer measurement data (THD/THD+N/EIN, etc.) is not publicly available. Published information indicates a largely flat response from roughly 20Hz to around 3kHz with an approximate +1.8dB lift near 16kHz, maximum output around +28dBu, and noise around −85dBm [1]. Third-party reviews also describe a lifted top-end character consistent with intentional coloration [2]. Due to limited systematic transparency metrics, policy defaults to 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 100% discrete component construction and custom-wound transformers faithfully recreate 1970s technology levels. The design based on original circuit diagrams and PCB layouts provided by EMI and Abbey Road is commendable for technical authenticity. However, by modern standards, equivalent functionality can be achieved with superior performance using contemporary technology, limiting its technological advantage.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Per policy, we compare against the world-cheapest option that is equal-or-better in core functions and measured transparency. Against TG2’s domestic street price (~¥470,800 tax-in) [1], a transparent modern alternative with equal core functions—Focusrite ISA Two (dual-channel, DI, 48V, phase reverse, variable input impedance)—is widely available around 999 USD internationally (domestically ~¥150,000). Ratio ≈ 150,000 ÷ 470,800 ≈ 0.32 → rounded to 0.3. TG2’s niche summing option is easily substituted, so price efficiency on core preamp functions is unfavorable.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While Chandler Limited has earned recognition as a specialized pro audio manufacturer, its limited scale creates uncertainty regarding long-term parts supply and support systems. The separate PSU-1 dedicated power supply unit requirement also presents maintenance challenges for the overall system. Information regarding warranty periods and specific support details is limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The concept of faithfully recreating 1970s vintage sound is understandable, but from modern acoustic transparency standards, it appears irrational. The intentional sonic coloration for added "character" represents a regressive approach from the perspective of faithful source reproduction. However, it maintains certain validity as a means to achieve specific sonic characteristics demanded by particular music genres and production styles.

## Advice

The TG2 is a niche choice for engineers seeking a specific historic character. If your aim is to recreate the Abbey Road-era tone, it delivers that value. If you prioritize transparency and price efficiency for core preamp duties, consider modern low-distortion alternatives such as the Focusrite ISA Two [3].
