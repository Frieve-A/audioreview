## Overview

The DEQX Pre-4 Digital Preamp Processor represents the fourth generation of DEQX's pioneering digital speaker correction technology. Founded in Sydney, Australia in the mid-1990s, DEQX has established itself as a world leader in digital signal processing with unique measurement and calibration algorithms. The Pre-4 features advanced ESS Sabre Pro ADC/DAC components, a hexacore ARM processor capable of 2GHz 64-bit convolution processing, and DEQX's proprietary "speaker first, then room" correction methodology. This approach measures each speaker's native impulse response errors and generates precise correction filters through their DEQX Cloud platform, aiming to deliver transparent audio processing with claimed THD+N performance of -115 dB.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The DEQX Pre-4 demonstrates excellent preliminary specifications with THD+N of -115 dB (0.00018%), significantly exceeding the transparent level criteria of 0.01% for harmonic distortion. The -140 dB digital processing noise floor indicates exceptional digital signal processing capabilities. ESS Sabre Pro DAC/ADC components are professional-grade and well-regarded in the industry, while the 2GHz 64-bit convolution processing represents advanced digital signal processing capabilities. However, all specifications remain preliminary manufacturer claims without third-party verification. Following conservative evaluation principles for non-verified measurements, the score reflects excellent claimed performance adjusted for lack of independent confirmation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

DEQX demonstrates world-leading technology in speaker correction with proprietary algorithms developed over decades. The Pre-4 incorporates cutting-edge hardware including a hexacore ARM processor, advanced 64-bit convolution processing at 2GHz, and sophisticated DEQX Cloud integration for calibration filter generation. The company's proprietary impulse response correction with low-latency implementation represents technology that other companies would want to adopt, requiring years for competitors to develop similar capabilities. The sophisticated time/phase alignment capabilities and "speaker first, then room" methodology are unique in the market, representing advanced integration of digital, software, and cloud technologies that demonstrate exceptional technical sophistication and originality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

CP = 1,299 USD รท 17,560 USD = 0.1

The miniDSP SHD is equipped with room correction (Dirac Live 3.x), multiple digital and analog inputs, and measured THD+N (0.0003%) and dynamic range (120dB) that are equivalent-or-better than the DEQX Pre-4's preliminary specifications [3]. Both products provide comprehensive digital preamp functions, volume control, network streaming capabilities, and professional room correction functionality. The miniDSP SHD's performance has been independently verified by Audio Science Review with SINAD measurements reaching 112 dB [6], while offering equivalent user-facing functionality at a substantially lower price point of 1,299 USD compared to the Pre-4's estimated 17,560 USD (converted from UK pricing as official US pricing is not available).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

DEQX demonstrates exceptional long-term support commitment, with software compatibility extending back to original processors from decades ago and many units remaining in use for over twenty years. The company provides comprehensive support infrastructure including a Beta Customer Service Desk for Gen-4 products, DEQXpert remote setup service via computer connection, and DEQX Cloud integration for ongoing calibration support. Response time commitment of three business days and the digital equipment's inherently reliable construction with few moving parts contribute to high reliability expectations. The established company history since the mid-1990s and proven track record of long-term product support demonstrate excellent reliability and support capabilities.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

DEQX demonstrates strong scientific rationality with their measurement-based approach to speaker correction, using real anechoic measurements for filter generation and "speaker first, then room" methodology. The company's focus on digital signal processing, cloud integration, and measurement-based correction aligns with scientifically rational approaches to audio improvement. Claims are backed by listening tests comparing direct wire connections versus processed signal paths, supporting their transparency assertions. The advancement from previous generations shows clear progression in function and measurement performance, and their pioneering of low-latency impulse response correction represents genuine innovation. However, the high price relative to alternatives with equivalent measured performance raises concerns about cost optimization relative to function and measurement performance.

## Advice

The DEQX Pre-4 offers cutting-edge speaker correction technology with sophisticated digital signal processing capabilities that represent the state-of-the-art in audio processor design. Potential purchasers should consider this product if they require the most advanced speaker correction algorithms available and are willing to invest significantly for proprietary technology advantages. However, those prioritizing cost-effectiveness should carefully evaluate alternatives like the miniDSP SHD, which offers equivalent room correction functionality and verified measured performance at approximately one-thirteenth the cost. The Pre-4 is best suited for users who specifically value DEQX's unique correction methodology and are less concerned with cost-performance ratios, particularly those with high-end systems where the premium investment aligns with overall system value.
