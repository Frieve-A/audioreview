## Overview

The Musikelectronic Geithain RL904 is a 2-way coaxial active studio monitor developed by the German audio equipment manufacturer Musikelectronic Geithain. The company was founded in 1960 and has been producing high-quality studio monitors for professional use since the 1980s. The RL904 is designed for small to medium-scale audio, video, and film production studios, featuring acoustic characteristics close to a point source due to its coaxial driver configuration. It employs a bass-reflex design to achieve low-frequency reproduction down to 40Hz and is driven by two internal power amplifiers (LF 150W, HF 100W).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The RL904 has nominal specifications of a frequency response from 40Hz to 20kHz (±3dB). However, detailed measurement data, such as frequency response, total harmonic distortion (THD), and directivity, from independent third-party sources are not publicly available. The lack of objective performance verification beyond the manufacturer's own data limits its scientific validity score. While the design philosophy of coaxial drivers and active crossovers is theoretically sound, the inability to confirm its implementation with objective data is a significant drawback.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The coaxial driver configuration is an advanced design, and the intentional slight offset of the tweeter from the woofer's central axis is a clever solution to mitigate intermodulation distortion, a common issue in coaxial designs. It includes features required for professional use, such as active crossovers powered by MOSFET amplifiers, a clipping warning LED for overload indication, and an automatic protection limiter for input overload. The in-house developed drivers and cabinet design show originality. However, it lacks features that are becoming standard in modern studio monitors, such as DSP for acoustic correction, more efficient Class-D amplifiers, or network audio capabilities, making its technological approach relatively conventional.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The price for a pair of RL904 monitors is 7,480 EUR. In contrast, competing products with equivalent or superior measured performance are available for a fraction of the price. For example, a pair of Neumann KH120A monitors costs 1,400 EUR, delivering comparable or higher fidelity for about 19% of the RL904's price (Calculation: 1,400 EUR / 7,480 EUR ≈ 0.187). Even lower-priced options like the Yamaha HS7 (450 EUR per pair) provide practical performance for basic monitoring needs. The pricing of the RL904 must be evaluated as highly uncompetitive for its performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Musikelectronic Geithain has a long history of supplying products to the professional audio industry. Its products are developed and manufactured in Germany and have a reputation for robust construction. As professional equipment, it is designed with an expectation of low failure rates and long-term use. However, its global service network and the responsiveness of its support system may be more limited compared to larger manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The RL904's design philosophy demonstrates a rational approach to professional studio monitoring through its coaxial driver configuration and active crossover design. The coaxial layout provides consistent directivity and phase coherence, which are essential for accurate monitoring. The active crossover and built-in amplification ensure optimal driver control and eliminate external amplifier matching issues. However, the lack of modern features like DSP room correction and the high price point relative to performance raise questions about the rationality of the current design approach in today's market.

## Advice

The RL904 is difficult to recommend to anyone other than users with a specific preference for coaxial designs. Modern alternatives like the Neumann KH 120 II, which are less expensive, come with publicly available detailed measurement data, and include DSP-based room correction, represent a far better choice. Considering the balance of price and performance, it is hard to find a compelling reason to choose the RL904. For any new purchase, we strongly recommend considering other options that offer better cost-performance and objective validation.
