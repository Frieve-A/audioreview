## Overview

The Fosi Audio ZA3 is a balanced dual-mode Class-D amplifier featuring TPA3255 chip with swappable op-amps. Pre-order shipping began from at least 28 January 2024 [6]; third-party reviews were published by March 2024. Priced 109.99-149.99 USD depending on PSU configuration. Features balanced XLR inputs, dual-mode stereo/mono operation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specifications cite THD &lt;0.006%, SINAD 89dB, SNR ≥106dB, and frequency response 20Hz–20kHz ±0.1dB [2]. Third-party testing reports that under 4Ω stereo loading the unit does not reach rated output and enters protection [1]. Evaluation is conservative, reflecting both manufacturer specs and third-party measurement results.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Uses established TPA3255 Class-D chip with premium Japanese/German capacitors [2]. Five socketed op-amps enable customization. Balanced XLR inputs provide professional connectivity. Technologies are proven but represent incremental improvements rather than innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

CP = 1.0 (no cheaper equivalent-or-better product exists)

No products found offering equivalent measured performance and functions at lower cost [3]. AIYIMA A70 shows SINAD ~95dB vs 89dB but costs 189 USD versus 109.99-149.99 USD range. ZA3 represents most cost-effective option in its class.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

24-month warranty with global support availability [4]. Responsive customer service via email and WhatsApp. User-replaceable op-amps extend serviceability. Some reported mono mode issues addressed through manufacturer support with replacement parts.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Demonstrates measurement-focused approach with Class-D efficiency and scientific specifications [5]. Power output with 48V PSU (155W×2 stereo, 235W mono) and 32V PSU (95W×2 stereo, 110W mono) shows PSU-dependent design. Some discrepancies between claimed and measured performance slightly undermine scientific approach.

## Advice

Suits users requiring balanced inputs and dual-mode flexibility at cost-effective pricing. Strong measured performance suitable for moderate-power applications. Op-amp rolling appeals to enthusiasts. Consider PSU selection for maximum performance. Be aware of power limitations versus claims for high-power applications.
