## Overview

The Roland MA-8 Stereo Micro Monitor was a discontinued computer speaker system designed specifically for computer applications. Released by the Japanese manufacturer Roland Corporation, this compact 2-way powered monitor featured a 10cm woofer and 4.7cm tweeter configuration with 8W + 8W amplification. The system included multiple connectivity options with two stereo line inputs, microphone input, and headphone output, along with individual bass/treble controls. Positioned as a dedicated stereo speaker system for computer users, the MA-8 was designed with magnetic shielding for monitor placement and marketed as delivering "CD-quality audio" in a compact form factor suitable for desktop environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. The Roland MA-8 provides only basic manufacturer specifications including frequency response range of 80Hz-18kHz and 8W + 8W power output, but lacks critical audio quality metrics. No deviation data (Â±dB) for frequency response, total harmonic distortion measurements, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, crosstalk, or other performance indicators are available from official sources. No credible third-party measurements were found for this discontinued product. Per evaluation framework guidelines, when comprehensive measurement data is unavailable for sound quality assessment, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 as the product cannot be properly evaluated against transparent performance criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The MA-8 represents a conventional approach using mature amplification technology without significant innovation. While benefiting from Roland's established audio expertise and in-house design capabilities, the product relies on basic analog amplification without advanced digital signal processing, software integration, or cutting-edge technologies. As a discontinued product, it employed technology that was already mature at its time of release, offering no significant technical differentiation in the competitive computer speaker market. The simple 2-way driver configuration and analog amplifier topology, while functional, provide no competitive advantage that other manufacturers would want to adopt, reflecting a conservative rather than innovative technical approach.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At approximately 100 USD, the MA-8's cost-performance is evaluated against equivalent alternatives. The Mackie CR3-X, with an MSRP of approximately 100 USD, provides equivalent functionality with superior 28W RMS total power output versus MA-8's 16W total, equivalent inputs (stereo line, microphone), comparable control set (bass/treble controls), and equivalent-or-better frequency response (80Hz-20kHz vs 80Hz-18kHz). Equipped with matching essential functions and equivalent-or-better performance specifications including higher power output and same frequency response range, the Mackie CR3-X represents equivalent functionality at the same price point. Since no cheaper equivalent-or-better alternatives exist, the MA-8 achieves the maximum cost-performance score of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The MA-8 benefits from Roland's established reliability track record and global support infrastructure. All Roland products include a standard 2-year warranty period, which meets average industry standards. The simple construction with basic amplification components and minimal moving parts contributes to inherent reliability, reducing potential failure points compared to more complex designs. However, as a discontinued product, long-term parts availability and repair support may become increasingly limited over time. Roland maintains comprehensive support documentation and service networks globally.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates concerning aspects regarding scientific rationality. While appropriately targeted for computer applications with practical features like magnetic shielding and multiple inputs, the product makes unsubstantiated claims including "CD-quality audio" without measurement backing or scientific validation. The conservative approach relies entirely on mature analog technology without innovation in digital signal processing, software integration, or measurement-based optimization that could meaningfully improve performance. Claims of audio quality improvements lack scientific substantiation through blind testing or objective measurements. The design represents a conventional approach that fails to leverage scientific methods for performance validation or adopt cutting-edge technologies that could provide actual audible benefits to users.

## Advice

For users seeking computer speakers in this discontinued product's former price range, superior alternatives exist with better performance specifications. The Mackie CR3-X provides equivalent functionality at the same price point with superior power output, while products like the PreSonus Eris E3.5 offer measurably better performance specifications including higher power output and wider frequency response. Potential buyers should prioritize products with available third-party measurement data to make informed decisions based on objective performance criteria. Given the lack of measurement data and availability of better-performing alternatives, this discontinued product cannot be recommended for purchase even in secondary markets.
