## Overview

The JC-120 Jazz Chorus is a 120-watt (2 × 60 W) solid-state 2×12 combo that delivers Roland’s true stereo chorus, plus vibrato, spring-style reverb and a dual-channel front end. It has remained in continuous production since 1975 and is widely positioned by Roland as a clean-tone reference in its own lineup [1][2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

From a transparency standpoint, key metrics (THD/THD+N, frequency response curves, SNR, crosstalk) are not published in Roland’s official materials; available documents confirm power, speakers, I/O and controls but omit fidelity measurements [1][2]. Given the lack of independent third-party lab data and the product’s design intent (integrated chorus/vibrato/distortion stages), we start from the 0.5 baseline for unknowns and adjust downward. Until quantified transparency data appears, a conservative scientific-validity score of 0.4 is appropriate.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Roland’s integrated true-stereo amplification and onboard analog modulation were technically notable at launch and remain distinctive today. The design is in-house and long-lived, but largely analog-only and matured rather than cutting-edge (no DSP, digital I/O, or modern integration). Netting these factors yields a solid but not bleeding-edge 0.6 [1][3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Denominator (review target market price, US):** 1,399.99 USD (major US retailers) [4][5].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better option:** **Two Boss Katana-100 Gen 3** combos linked via **Stereo Expand** (true stereo effects across two amps). Each unit is 100 W with onboard effects; Stereo Expand is documented on Roland/BOSS support and product materials [6][7][5].  
**Price of comparator (US):** 449.99 USD × 2 = **899.98 USD** [6].  
**Calculation (display rule):** 899.98 ÷ 1,399.99 = **0.64** → round to one decimal → **0.6**.

Short rationale for equivalence (user perspective): Provides stereo chorus/reverb operation across two cabinets at equal-or-higher clean headroom (two 100 W power sections) with comparable user-facing functions (clean tones, modulation, reverb, line/headphone outs). Therefore, CP = 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Roland/BOSS provide a global network and a standard two-year warranty for products in scope in the US, with additional regional policies; repair infrastructure and parts availability are well-established [8][9]. The JC-120’s simple solid-state architecture and decades-long production track record support high reliability expectations. Given warranty period (average) but strong field longevity and support footprint, 0.8 is justified.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This score evaluates development direction—not data disclosure. The JC-120 pursues an **unchanged analog** architecture focused on a specific chorus-forward aesthetic rather than measured transparency or modern integration. Deductions are applied for **long-term stagnation in measurable advancement** and **analog-only** implementation without DSP/digital features that could advance objective control and repeatability. Positively, it makes **no non-scientific claims** and its integrated stereo chorus with dual power sections serves a legitimate, purpose-built musical use case. Net: conservative but non-occult design direction → 0.3.

## Advice

Choose the JC-120 if you explicitly want its **true stereo chorus** and enduring clean voicing in a single, road-proven combo. If your priority is **price-to-function** for clean headroom and stereo ambience, two Katana-100 Gen 3 amps in Stereo Expand achieve similar or greater practical capability at a lower combined US price (CP basis above). If you require documented transparency metrics (THD/FR/SNR), shortlist products that publish third-party measurements or provide detailed manufacturer test conditions.
