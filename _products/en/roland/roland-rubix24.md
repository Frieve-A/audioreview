## Overview

The Roland Rubix24 is a 2-in/4-out USB audio interface supporting up to 24-bit/192kHz audio. It includes two low-noise mic pres, a Hi-Z input, **hardware compressor/limiter**, MIDI I/O, ground lift, and a shielded metal chassis[2]. While practical, it competes with numerous alternatives that match or exceed its specs at lower prices.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs list **dynamic range of 104dB (A/D) and 109dB (D/A)** plus **residual noise of −94 dBu (IHF-A)**[1]. 24-bit/192kHz support is standard today and suggests adequate transparency for typical recording tasks. However, we have not found comprehensive independent measurements (THD+N/IMD/FR), so we cannot confirm transparent-level thresholds; this score remains provisional.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This is a conventional USB interface design. The onboard comp/limiter and shielding are practical but not technologically novel versus peers. Without standout measured advances or technical papers, we rate it around industry-average implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Review target price: 284.99 USD**[3]. The **Behringer U-Phoria UMC204HD** offers equivalent **2-in/4-out**, **24-bit/192kHz** capability and similar dynamic-range class for **109 USD**[4][5].  
**109 USD ÷ 284.99 USD = 0.382** → round to one decimal place → **0.4**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Roland’s global support footprint and warranty are solid. Class-compliant operation and the metal build generally translate to dependable day-to-day use. Some Windows setup reports exist, so we stop short of a perfect score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The I/O, practical hardware processing, and live/streaming-friendly touches are sensible[2]. Pricing is the sticking point: multiple products deliver equivalent functionality at far lower cost.

## Advice

Choose Rubix24 if you specifically want **hardware comp/limiter** and **ground-lift** on a compact 2x4 box. If you prioritize the **lowest price for similar capability**, UMC204HD at **109 USD** is compelling[4][5]. If you value **higher measured headroom/low EIN**, consider **MOTU M4** (120dB output DR, −129 dBu EIN)[6][7].
