## Overview

Roland’s Quad-Capture UA-55 (2011, discontinued) is a compact USB 2.0 interface marketed as “4-in/4-out,” realized as **two analog inputs with VS preamps plus coaxial S/PDIF I/O**[1]. It supports 24-bit/192 kHz (note: **192 kHz operates at 2-in/2-out**) and includes AUTO-SENS auto gain, VS Streaming low-latency drivers, USB bus power, and **MIDI I/O**[1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs report **104 dB A/D** and **109 dB D/A dynamic range**, reaching a transparent baseline for project-studio work. Frequency response is **20 Hz–22 kHz (+0/−2 dB) at 48 kHz** and **20 Hz–90 kHz (+0/−8 dB; +0/−2 dB to 60 kHz) at 192 kHz**[1]. Independent, comprehensive third-party benches (THD+N, crosstalk) are limited, so this is a **provisional** assessment based mainly on catalog data[1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Solid for its era (VS preamps, AUTO-SENS, stable low-latency drivers) but ordinary by today’s standards where USB-C, built-in loopback, and higher converter performance are common. Still, **packing S/PDIF and MIDI in a small bus-powered chassis** remains practical[1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Using **349 USD** as the UA-55 price basis, we select **PreSonus Studio 1810c** as the **cheapest equal-or-better** current comparator: it provides **stereo S/PDIF I/O, MIDI I/O, four mic preamps, 24-bit/192 kHz**, and specs of **110 dB (mic pre DR) / 112 dB (line DR)**[3][5]. Official store price is **299.99 USD**[4].  
**CP = 299.99 USD ÷ 349 USD = 0.86 → 0.9** (rounded to one decimal). **As a pure price-for-capability metric this is strong**, even though **its measured performance trails recent interfaces**[1][5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Build quality and driver stability were historical strengths, but support is limited now that it’s discontinued. Roland’s page indicates Intel-only macOS coverage (**Apple Silicon not supported**), constraining long-term usability on modern Macs[2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A rational focus on measurable transparency (flat FR, adequate DR, stable drivers) is evident[1]. The “Quad-Capture” name can mislead buyers into expecting four **analog** inputs; the fourth pair is via S/PDIF—worth clarifying at purchase time[1].

## Advice

If you **need S/PDIF and MIDI** in a compact unit, the UA-55 still works; for new purchases, **Studio 1810c** offers better value and current support with **equal-or-better specs**[3][4][5]. Existing UA-55 owners can keep using it on compatible systems and plan an upgrade if moving to Apple Silicon Macs[2].
