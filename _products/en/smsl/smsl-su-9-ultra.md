## Overview

SU-9 Ultra is a balanced desktop DAC built around AKM’s AK4191 + AK4499EX with XMOS XU-316. It offers USB/optical/coaxial inputs, balanced XLR and single-ended RCA outputs, LDAC-capable Bluetooth, and MQA/MQA-CD decoding over both USB and S/PDIF. It supports PCM up to 32-bit/768kHz and DSD512, positioning it among today’s transparent DACs in practical use [1][6].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The published numbers—THD+N 0.00006% (-124dB), SNR 132dB (XLR), XLR 5Vrms / RCA 2.5Vrms—are comfortably below audibility thresholds, i.e., in the “transparent” region. As of this writing, no comprehensive third-party lab suite for SU-9 Ultra was located, so this is a **provisional** assessment based on manufacturer specifications and established engineering context; we will incorporate independent data when available [1][6].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The architecture (AK4499EX+AK4191 with separated digital/analog domains, XU-316 true 32-bit USB, CK-03 clocking, discrete linear regulation) reflects competent, modern implementation. While proprietary disclosures are limited, the integration is coherent and technically sound [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Reviewed unit price (denominator)**: **499 USD** [4].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator**: **Topping E70V (E70 Velvet)** with LDAC Bluetooth, balanced XLR/RCA, PCM768/DSD512; third-party measurements show **transparent-class** performance (≈121dB SINAD) [2]. **Current new price** observed at **349 USD (Amazon)** [3].

**Computation**: 349 USD ÷ 499 USD = **0.70** → rounded to **0.7**.  
**Equivalence note**: LDAC BT, balanced outputs, PCM768/DSD512, and transparent-region THD+N/SINAD qualify it as equal-or-better from the user’s perspective [2][3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer warranty is commonly **1 year** globally (EU regions may see 2 years; some retailers advertise extended coverage). SMSL maintains download/support portals for drivers/firmware. Net: average to slightly positive outlook on reliability/support [5][7][4].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Resources are directed toward measurable transparency and user-facing functionality (LDAC BT, MQA, balanced outputs) without conspicuous non-scientific claims. It’s a pragmatic, measurement-aligned design approach rather than a marketing-driven one [1].

## Advice

If you need a **transparent desktop DAC** with flexible inputs (USB, TV/coax, optical) and balanced outputs, SU-9 Ultra is a safe pick. XLR 5Vrms plays nicely with active speakers or external preamps, and XU-316 ensures robust USB behavior. If MQA isn’t critical and budget matters, note that **E70V** achieves a comparable transparent endpoint at a **lower price** today [2][3][4].
