## Overview

The SMSL DA-8S was a budget integrated amplifier that offered 80 watts per channel into 4 ohms using Infineon Class-D technology. It featured Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity with aptX support, a balanced stereo XLR input alongside single-ended RCA, and a front display with remote control [1][2]. Retailer listing indicates the unit is discontinued [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are no credible third-party measurement reports confirmed for DA-8S as of the review date. Manufacturer/retailer specifications document output power 2×80W @ 4Ω, 2×40W @ 8Ω, efficiency >92%, inputs (balanced XLR, RCA, Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX) [2]. In the absence of independent THD+N, SNR, FR and crosstalk data, the score is kept at the policy baseline with manufacturer figures clearly labeled and cited, to be revised if third-party data appears [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

DA-8S employs established components such as an Infineon MA12070 Class‑D stage and NJW1194 volume control IC, with balanced XLR input and Bluetooth 5.0 (aptX) [1][2]. These are competent but conventional choices without evident innovation beyond contemporary norms, warranting a slightly-below-average score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Comparison target selection follows the “cheapest equivalent-or-better” rule. We require an integrated amplifier with both a balanced input and integrated aptX Bluetooth. The cheapest such product found is AIYIMA A80 (balanced TRS input, Bluetooth 5.x with aptX family) at 206.99 USD (current Amazon list) [3]. No cheaper integrated alternative with both balanced input and aptX Bluetooth was confirmed as of the review date. Therefore, by definition, CP is clamped at 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Retailer status shows DA-8S as discontinued [2], which typically reduces parts availability and official support compared to active models. Warranty only applied during its sales period; ongoing firmware support is not applicable here. Thus, the score remains below average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design uses rational, proven building blocks (efficient Class‑D, NJW1194, balanced input, Bluetooth with aptX) to meet common use‑cases at low cost [1][2]. There are no non‑scientific claims. Overall, the approach is reasonable but not notably advanced, leading to a mid score.

## Advice

Given its discontinued status [2], DA-8S is not recommended for new purchases. For similar functionality in current production, consider AIYIMA A80 (balanced input plus Bluetooth) [3], or pair a current integrated/power amplifier with an external aptX Bluetooth receiver if balanced input is not required.
