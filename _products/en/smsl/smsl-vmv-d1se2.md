## Overview

The SMSL VMV D1se2 is a flagship desktop DAC built around ESS’s ES9039MSPRO. Compared to the original D1se, it adds MQA-CD decoding and updates the USB interface to XMOS XU-316. Connectivity includes USB, optical, coaxial, I²S (HDMI), and balanced XLR/RCA outputs, plus Bluetooth 5.0 with LDAC/aptX-HD. Independent measurements confirm top-tier objective performance (SINAD 123 dB, Audio Science Review list, May 2023) alongside comprehensive format support. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Audio Science Review reports SINAD of **123 dB** for the D1se2, placing it in the transparent performance tier with vast headroom against audibility thresholds. Manufacturer specifications quote **THD+N 0.00005% (-125 dB)**, **SNR 133 dB (XLR)**, and **dynamic range 133 dB (XLR) / 128 dB (RCA)**; all exceed the transparent targets (e.g., THD+N ≤0.01%, SNR ≥105 dB, DR ≥105 dB). These results indicate fidelity limited by the recording/playback chain rather than the DAC itself. [1][2][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Key technologies include the **ES9039MSPRO** (8-channel HyperStream IV architecture used in parallel for lower noise), **XMOS XU-316** USB interface (PCM 32-bit/768 kHz, DSD512), and full **MQA/MQA-CD** decoding over USB/SPDIF. Wireless input supports **Bluetooth 5.0** with **LDAC/aptX-HD/aptX/SBC/AAC**. Balanced XLR outputs deliver 5.2 Vrms; RCA 2.5 Vrms. The feature set and interface breadth are state-of-the-art for a desktop DAC. [1][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better): SMSL DO300** — balanced XLR/RCA, USB/optical/coaxial/I²S/AES, Bluetooth 5.x with LDAC, full **MQA & MQA-CD**, and **SINAD 123 dB** (ASR). Current market price confirmed at **529 USD** (Amazon US). Therefore:

**529 USD ÷ 720 USD = 0.73 → score 0.7**

*Equivalence note:* DO300 matches user-visible functions (balanced I/O, BT with modern codecs, I²S, MQA/MQA-CD) and equals measured transparency (SINAD), thus qualifying as equal-or-better from a user perspective. [2][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Retailers (e.g., ShenzhenAudio) indicate a **two-year warranty** for the VMV D1se2. Real-world support experience varies by seller and region; buyers should confirm local warranty handling and service channels prior to purchase. Build quality and thermals are typical for modern desktop DACs with low idle power draw (<10 W). [3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The product prioritizes measured transparency via modern ICs and careful I/O implementation. Engineering choices (multi-DAC summing, robust USB interface, balanced topology) map directly to lower noise/distortion, aligning with evidence-based high-fidelity goals. Investments target performance and usability rather than non-audible cosmetics.

## Advice

If you want **flagship-class measurements plus full format coverage including MQA-CD**, the D1se2 delivers. However, the **DO300** provides essentially the **same measured class and features for less money**, improving objective value. Choose the D1se2 if you specifically prefer its VMV styling/UX or find a favorable price; otherwise, the DO300 is the rational buy on pure function-per-dollar. [2][4]
