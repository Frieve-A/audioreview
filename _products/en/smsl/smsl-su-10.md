## Overview

The SMSL SU-10 is a flagship desktop DAC built around dual ESS ES9038PRO converters with a 16-channel summing architecture, XMOS XU316 USB, and a fully regulated dual-linear power supply (separate rails for digital/analog). It supports PCM 32-bit/768 kHz, native DSD512, MQA/MQA-CD, and Bluetooth with LDAC. Connectivity includes USB, optical, coaxial, AES/EBU, I2S (HDMI), and BT. At 900 USD, it targets users seeking transparent, measurement-driven performance with modern I/O [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Manufacturer-stated measurements: THD+N 0.00005% (−126 dB), dynamic range 135 dB (XLR), and S/N ratio 135 dB (XLR) [1]. Third-party testing at Audio Science Review characterizes SU-10 performance as “state of the art,” with results approaching the analyzer noise floor on XLR, i.e., effectively transparent for human hearing under controlled conditions [3]. Output levels are specified at ≈5.1 Vrms (XLR) and ≈2.6 Vrms (RCA), ensuring full-scale headroom into downstream gear [4]. These figures comfortably exceed transparency thresholds for DACs (e.g., S/N ≥105 dB, THD+N ≤0.01%).

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design uses two ES9038PRO chips in a parallel-channel topology, a third-generation USB interface (XMOS XU316), 21 OPA1612 op-amps in the analog stage, clock management, and extensive local regulation with dual linear supplies [1][2]. While execution quality is high, most building blocks are proven off-the-shelf rather than proprietary innovation, so the score reflects excellent implementation over novelty.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Comparator selection (equivalent-or-better):** TOPPING D90 III SABRE — dual ES9039SPRO, XMOS XU316, LDAC BT, I2S/AES, MQA, and manufacturer specs at or above SU-10 (e.g., THD+N <0.000041%, DR up to ≈135 dB) [5][6][7]. Representative market price: **899 USD** [6][8].  
**Calculation (class-agnostic, cheapest equivalent-or-better):** 899 USD ÷ 900 USD = **0.999** ⇒ **1.0** after rounding.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

CNC aluminum chassis and tempered-glass display imply robust mechanics. SMSL offers standard distributor-backed warranty (commonly 2 years via major retailers) and has issued firmware updates for recent platforms; however, long-term failure-rate data remain limited relative to legacy high-end brands [2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Engineering choices (dual-mono DAC summing, dual linear PSU, regulated rails, modern USB and BT stack) directly target measurable transparency and usability. Inclusion of MQA/MQA-CD adds cost without consensus evidence of audible improvement over lossless PCM; otherwise the feature set aligns with rational, measurement-centric design [1][2].

## Advice

If your downstream chain is already transparent, the SU-10’s measurable performance ensures audibly transparent conversion while adding broad input coverage (USB/I2S/AES/BT with LDAC). Balanced 5.1 Vrms output eases gain staging into active speakers and balanced headphone chains. If you do not need I2S/MQA/BT or the extra I/O, check whether an equivalently measuring DAC (e.g., D90 III SABRE) at a similar or slightly lower price better fits your budget [5][6][8].
