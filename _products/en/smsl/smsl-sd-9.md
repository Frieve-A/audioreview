## Overview

The SMSL SD-9 is a network digital music player (transport) supporting local storage and network streaming (DLNA/AirPlay), with I2S (HDMI), AES/EBU, coaxial, optical, and USB digital outputs, Bluetooth TX/RX, and HiBy Link app control. Manufacturer specs state up to 32-bit/384 kHz PCM and DSD256 over USB/I2S, and DoP/D2P options on S/PDIF. These features, especially the combination of I2S and AES/EBU at this price, are uncommon among streamers. [2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a digital transport, audible differences mainly hinge on interface behavior (e.g., jitter) rather than analog metrics. Audio Science Review measured the SD-9 and noted elevated jitter spurs versus best-in-class but characterized them as likely not audibly concerning; a 24-bit 1 kHz dithered tone also showed harmonics that slightly reduced SINAD. Overall, the unit delivers bit-perfect data and functions adequately, but measurements do not demonstrate clear audible advantages over competent alternatives. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The SD-9 uses established technologies (SoC + clocking/CPLD, dual-band Wi-Fi, standard streaming protocols) and does not present novel DSP, room correction, or software innovation. The inclusion of both I2S and AES/EBU outputs is practically useful but not inherently advanced. Therefore, implementation quality appears industry-average with no unique technical breakthroughs claimed in public materials. [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price is **344 USD** (typical new street price). To assess CP, we looked for the **cheapest product with equal-or-better user functions and measured-relevant digital outputs** (specifically, network streaming plus **both** I2S and AES/EBU). Matrix Audio element S (I2S + AES/EBU) and HoloAudio RED (I2S + AES/EBU) both qualify functionally but are substantially more expensive (around 1,499 USD and 798–878 USD, respectively). Cheaper streamers like the WiiM Ultra lack I2S/AES-EBU and thus are **not** equivalent. As no cheaper equivalent-or-better product could be identified, **CP = 1.0** by definition. [4][5][6][7][8]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

SMSL provides a standard warranty via dealers and has issued firmware updates for network products historically, though cadence varies by model. The SD-9’s digital-only signal path implies fewer aging components than analog gear, but long-term update/support horizon is typical for this class and brand; no abnormal failure data is publicly established. Overall, an average showing for warranty and support. (General brand/product information.) 

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Focusing spend on a compact transport that exposes multiple digital outputs—including I2S and AES/EBU—has clear system-integration logic for users with external DACs that accept these inputs. However, absent advanced DSP/room features or demonstrably superior measured performance, the approach is functional rather than groundbreaking. Claims remain within conventional engineering without resorting to non-scientific narratives. [2][3]

## Advice

Choose the SD-9 if you specifically need **both** I2S and AES/EBU from a network transport at low cost—there is no cheaper single-box streamer providing this combination as of the review date. If you **do not** need I2S/AES-EBU, cheaper streamers (e.g., WiiM Ultra) can offer broader convenience (app ecosystem, preamp/DAC features) at similar or lower prices, but they are **not** functionally equivalent regarding digital output formats. If you need additional processing (room correction, EQ, multiroom), consider higher-end platforms or adding software on the playback side. [4][8]
