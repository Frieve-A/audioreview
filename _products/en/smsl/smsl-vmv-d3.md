rating: [2.6, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.6, 0.2]
price: 3499
summary: "With 98dB SINAD the D3 reaches transparent-level performance, but its value is poor versus equally featured and better-measuring options like the Gustard A26 (USD 1,499.99) that include I2S and a 10MHz clock input."

## Overview

SMSL’s VMV D3 is a fully balanced R-2R DAC using four discontinued Burr-Brown PCM1704U-J chips (two per channel). Around this vintage core it adds modern blocks—XMOS XU216 USB, dual ultra–low phase-noise oscillators, SM5847, and seven TI OPA1612 op-amps—with comprehensive inputs (USB-B, I2S over HDMI, optical, coaxial, AES/EBU) and an **external clock input**, all in a milled aluminum chassis with a segregated power supply. [2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent measurements report **98dB SINAD**[1], equivalent to **THD+N ≈ 10^(-98/20) ≈ 0.00126%**, comfortably below common audibility thresholds (~0.01%, −80dB). The manufacturer specifies **~112dB dynamic range**[2], consistent with transparent playback. We therefore rate it at 0.7.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Execution is careful—low-jitter clocks, CPLD clock processing, XU216 USB—yet the PCM1704U-J ladder DAC is a mature architecture rather than cutting edge. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better):** **Gustard A26** with **I2S (HDMI)** and a **10MHz external clock input**, **THD+N ≤0.0001%**, and **dynamic range >127dB**[3], selling for **USD 1,499.99**[4].  
**Calculation:** **1,499.99 USD ÷ 3,499 USD = 0.428… → 0.4**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Robust build and standard support channels are positives; long-term serviceability is uncertain due to the discontinued PCM1704U-J. [2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The D3 emphasizes a nostalgic R-2R core over measurable improvements in distortion/noise. Without controlled-test advantages attributable to features like external clocking, the design philosophy rates low on rationality. [1][2]

## Advice

Buy the D3 if you specifically want a premium PCM1704U-J implementation with external clock and I2S. For objective fidelity per dollar with the same key functions, **Gustard A26** provides higher measured performance at ~43% of the price. [3][4]
