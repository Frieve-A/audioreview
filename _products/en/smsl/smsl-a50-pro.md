## Overview

The SMSL A50 Pro is a 2.1-channel Class D amplifier featuring dual Infineon MA12070P chips. It delivers 2x70W @ 4Ω + 100W @ 2Ω power output and offers comprehensive connectivity including HDMI ARC, Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C, optical digital, and 3.5mm AUX inputs. The design specializes in 2.1ch system construction with dedicated subwoofer volume control and high-pass/low-pass filter adjustment functions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

According to official specifications, the amplifier demonstrates excellent measurement values of THD+N 0.005%, an S/N ratio of 105dB, and channel separation of 95dB. The THD+N clears the 0.01% transparency level, and the S/N ratio reaches the 105dB transparency threshold. Although detailed frequency response deviation data is not publicly available, the key specifications confirm its scientific validity for improving audible sound quality. As a Class D amplifier, it achieves measurement performance that is transparent on nearly all metrics.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The MA12070P chip provides efficient and stable Class D amplification through a standard industry solution. While the 2.1ch dedicated design and crossover adjustment functions are practical, technical uniqueness and advancement remain limited. The circuit design is solid but stays within industry-average technology levels. Modern approaches such as digital signal processing or AI utilization are not employed, positioning this as an extension of conventional amplifier design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

With a market price of approximately 87 USD, this amplifier offers HDMI ARC, 2.1-channel output, subwoofer crossover adjustment, and sufficient power. As of 2025, it is difficult to find an alternative product that provides all these features at a lower price. Therefore, it is effectively the world's most affordable option for its feature set, earning it the highest cost-performance rating of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

SMSL has an established market presence as a Chinese audio manufacturer, though detailed long-term failure rate data and information on repair infrastructure remain limited. Standard warranty periods are provided, but the support infrastructure represents an average level for an overseas brand. Initial defect rates are estimated to be at industry-average levels, while long-term reliability data remains unknown.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The 2.1ch system-dedicated design approach is a rational direction premised on subwoofer integration. HDMI ARC implementation simplifies television connectivity and enhances usability. Class D amplification represents a scientifically rational choice from efficiency and miniaturization perspectives. The crossover frequency adjustment functionality is a practical design for accommodating different speaker combinations. Achieving near-transparent measurement performance at this price point demonstrates a highly rational overall design philosophy.

## Advice

The SMSL A50 Pro is an excellent choice for users building a 2.1ch system, especially those looking to easily improve their television audio system. The installation and operational convenience offered by the HDMI ARC function is a significant value, and if this feature is required, the product boasts extremely high cost-performance. While more affordable amplifiers exist if HDMI ARC is not needed, the balance of functionality and price in this product is outstanding. Given its excellent measurement performance, this product can deliver high satisfaction when obtained at an appropriate price.
