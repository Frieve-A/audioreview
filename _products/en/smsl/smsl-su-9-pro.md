## Overview

The SMSL SU-9 Pro is a compact balanced desktop DAC built around ESS’s ES9039MS Pro D/A converter. It adds third-generation XMOS XU-316 USB processing, up to eleven OPA1612A op-amps in the analog stage, and full high-res support (PCM up to 768kHz/32-bit, DSD512). Notably, **both USB and S/PDIF inputs support MQA and MQA-CD decoding**, and Bluetooth 5.0 includes LDAC/aptX HD. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Independent lab measurements are available and confirm transparency-level performance. L7Audiolab provides a full test suite (including dashboards, linearity, multitone) for SU-9 Pro; their notes also flag minor digital-domain artifacts around certain jitter/12k tests. Reference Audio Analyzer (RAA) hosts a professional report with interactive plots covering FR, crosstalk, spectra, and more. Together these third-party sources substantiate that the SU-9 Pro performs audibly transparent within modern DAC limits. [2][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

ES9039MS Pro is a current-generation ESS part; SMSL couples it with the XU-316 USB interface (true 32-bit path), their CK-03 clocking, and an expanded OPA1612A output stage. Feature coverage is complete for a desktop DAC in 2025: balanced/unbalanced outputs, USB/optical/coaxial with DoP/DSD, LDAC Bluetooth, and a remote UI. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better): SMSL DO200 MKII — 469 USD.**  
Reason: balanced/unbalanced outputs, **MQA/MQA-CD on both USB and S/PDIF**, LDAC Bluetooth, and equivalent transparency-class performance; adds extra I/O (I²S, AES/EBU). [4][5]

**CP calculation (policy formula):**  
CP = min(1.0, 469 USD / 499 USD) = 0.94 → **0.9**

This score is adopted as the Cost-Performance evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Warranty and support remain limited compared to major brands. SMSL’s official shop references a **one-year** factory warranty and retailer-mediated service; third-party retailer pages in the U.S. likewise list **one-year** coverage. Community reports indicate mixed experiences with RMA handling and regional support availability. [6][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

SMSL pursues measurable transparency via modern ESS silicon, clean USB implementation, disciplined clocking, and a straightforward analog stage. Features like MQA on **both** USB and S/PDIF and LDAC BT serve practical use cases; there is no reliance on unverifiable or occult claims. [1][2][3]

## Advice

If you specifically need **MQA on S/PDIF as well as USB** in a compact, remote-operated desktop DAC, the SU-9 Pro fits well. If value is paramount and you can accommodate a slightly larger unit with more I/O, the **DO200 MKII at 469 USD** undercuts the SU-9 Pro while meeting or exceeding its functional set. [4][5]
