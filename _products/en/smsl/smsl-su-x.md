summary: "Flagship desktop DAC with dual ES9039MSPRO chips. Excellent specs and full connectivity (USB/optical/coax/AES/I2S, LDAC Bluetooth, MQA), but objective value is limited when an equivalent-function, transparent alternative like SMSL DO200 MKII sells for 469 USD."

## Overview

The SMSL **SU-X** is a flagship balanced desktop DAC introduced in **2024**. It uses **dual ESS ES9039MSPRO** in an 8-channel mono configuration and an **XMOS XU-316** USB interface. Connectivity is comprehensive: **USB, optical, coaxial, AES/EBU, and I2S** digital inputs, **Bluetooth (Qualcomm; LDAC up to 24-bit/96 kHz plus aptX/HD, AAC, SBC)**, and balanced **XLR** / unbalanced **RCA** outputs. SMSL cites **THD+N 0.00004% (-128 dB)**, CK-03 clock processing, and a **second PLL** with **two independent linear power supplies** for digital/analog sections [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As of the review date, **independent third-party bench measurements of SU-X are not yet available**. Manufacturer specifications indicate audibly transparent performance (**THD+N 0.00004% (-128 dB); PCM up to 32-bit/768 kHz; DSD512**) [1]. These are **catalog specs**; we treat them as provisional until verified by trusted measurement labs. No claims beyond transparency are made.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Dual ES9039MSPRO with channel summing, XU-316 USB, **CK-03** clocking and **2nd-stage PLL**, **I2S and AES/EBU inputs**, LDAC-capable Bluetooth, and dual linear power supplies reflect a modern, technically ambitious implementation that goes beyond baseline DAC designs [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Comparator:** **SMSL DO200 MKII** — chosen because it offers **balanced XLR/RCA outputs; USB/optical/coaxial/**AES/EBU**/**I2S** inputs; **Bluetooth with LDAC**; and **transparent measured performance** reported by Audio Science Review. Its feature set is **equivalent from a user perspective**, and published measurements indicate transparency at **~120 dB-class SINAD** (balanced) [3][4][5].

- **Prices used (representative, non-sale):** SU-X **999 USD** [2]; DO200 MKII **469 USD** [4].  
- **Calculation (policy formula):** CP = min(1.0, 469 USD ÷ 999 USD) = 0.469 → **0.5**.

**Equivalence note (minimal requirement):** DO200 MKII is **equipped with balanced outputs and USB/optical/coax/AES/I2S**, and its **SINAD and dynamic range are at transparent levels**, so **functions and audible performance are equivalent** for users [3][4][5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Typical **warranty coverage is 1 year** via authorized dealers; return/after-sales terms depend on the retailer [6][7]. Build quality appears solid, but reports note the unit **runs warm** under load, typical for dual-DAC linear-supply designs [2]. With standard warranty length and no systemic reliability data, we keep the score neutral.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design prioritizes **measurable transparency** using robust clocking and power. That is rational. However, given that **audibly transparent DACs with the same user-facing functions** are available for **roughly half the price**, the SU-X’s premium mainly buys construction/feature polish rather than clearly audible improvements.

## Advice

If you specifically need **I2S and AES/EBU, LDAC Bluetooth, balanced outputs**, and prefer the SU-X form factor or matching **SH-X** stack, the SU-X will satisfy. If you prioritize **objective value at transparent performance**, **SMSL DO200 MKII** achieves **equivalent user-facing functionality and transparency** for **469 USD**, yielding a much higher performance-per-dollar [4][5].
