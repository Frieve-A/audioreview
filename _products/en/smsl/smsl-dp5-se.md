## Overview

The SMSL DP5-SE is a network music player/DAC released in 2024 using ESS’s ES9039Q2M. It offers Wi-Fi/Ethernet streaming, local playback (microSD/USB/NAS), Bluetooth in/out, and wide connectivity: RCA/XLR analog outs, AES/EBU, optical/coaxial, USB audio out, I²S, plus a 6.35 mm headphone jack. USB audio out supports up to 32-bit/768 kHz PCM and DSD512; built-in playback supports up to 32-bit/384 kHz and DSD256 (manufacturer/retailer). [3][5]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specifications list THD+N at **0.00009 %** and dynamic range/SNR at **126 dB (A-wtd)** for the DP5-SE’s line outputs—well inside transparency thresholds. Headphone output power is **89 mW (32 Ω)** / **64 mW (64 Ω)** / **27 mW (150 Ω)** / **14 mW (300 Ω)**, with line-out levels **2.1 Vrms (RCA)** and **5.2 Vrms (XLR)**. USB audio out supports up to **32-bit/768 kHz** PCM and **DSD512**. (All manufacturer figures.) [3][5]

Independent third-party lab measurements specific to DP5-SE were not found at the time of writing. Given this, the score is conservatively set at **0.6** based on the clearly stated, transparent-level manufacturer numbers. We will incorporate credible third-party data once available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The DP5-SE employs ESS’s latest ES9039Q2M (HyperStream IV). Datasheet figures show **130 dB** dynamic range and **–120 dB THD+N**, a modest step over the older ES9038Q2M (**129 dB DNR**). Independent tests of ES9039Q2M-based devices also show improved low-level behavior. [1][2] SMSL’s implementation adds balanced XLR, AES/EBU, I²S, USB audio out, and a basic head-amp; otherwise it follows conventional reference approaches, so we keep Technology Level at **0.6**.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Price used (review target): 379 USD** (official store). [4]

**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **FiiO R7** desktop streaming DAC/amp with balanced XLR/RCA line outs, integrated streamer OS, and high-power headphone outputs; published DAC-stage specs meet transparent thresholds. **Market price: 699 USD**. [8]  
Since **no cheaper product** with **equal-or-better user-facing functions** (balanced analog outs + streamer + head-amp) and **transparent-class performance** was found, DP5-SE is currently the least-cost option among equivalents → **CP = 1.0**.

*Note:* If you **don’t need balanced analog or I²S**, the **WiiM Ultra (329 USD)** is an excellent alternative with HDMI ARC and a touchscreen, but it lacks balanced analog outputs and I²S—hence not used for CP. [6][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The official shop indicates a **one-year warranty**. [4] The original **DP5** platform (ES9038PRO) drew reports of firmware/software issues and subsequent fixes; while DP5-SE ships with an updated UI, we found **no robust field-failure statistics** yet for this model. Given streamers’ reliance on firmware/app maintenance and limited transparency on update cadence, Reliability & Support is kept at an average **0.5**. [10][11]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The DP5-SE prioritizes measurable fidelity (modern ESS DAC) and **practical connectivity** (balanced XLR, AES/EBU, I²S, USB out). As a dedicated streamer/DAC it improves convenience versus a PC+DAC chain, but introduces no notably novel DSP/software features. The choices are sound and user-oriented rather than innovative, so **0.6**.

## Advice

Need **balanced analog outs + I²S + streamer** at the **lowest price** with a basic head-amp? The **DP5-SE** is compelling. Prefer richer UI/HDMI ARC and don’t need balanced? Consider **WiiM Ultra (329 USD)**. Want a **stronger head-amp** with balanced outs in one box? The **FiiO R7 (699 USD)** is the next step up—at a higher price. [4][6][7][8]
