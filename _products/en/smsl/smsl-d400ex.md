## Overview

The SMSL D400EX is a flagship desktop DAC using **dual AK4499EX** in true dual-mono with an **AK4191** modulator front-end. USB input is **XMOS XU-316**. It supports PCM up to **32-bit/768 kHz**, native **DSD512**, and **MQA/MQA-CD** decoding. Inputs include **USB, Optical, Coaxial, Bluetooth, I2S, and AES/EBU**; outputs are balanced XLR and single-ended RCA[2][3].  
**Street price** at writing: **959.99 USD** (official shop)[7]. We also confirmed availability on Amazon Japan[8].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

- **Published specs**: **THD+N 0.00006% (-124 dB, A-wtd)**, **Dynamic Range 133 dB (XLR) / 128 dB (RCA)**, **SNR 133 dB**[3]—well within transparent territory.  
- **Independent data**: L7Audiolab measured **~120 dB SINAD (SE/RCA)**, confirming transparency[4].  
- **Additional notes**: ASR observed **perfect USB jitter**, a **tiny Toslink jitter spur**, and a small **mid-level IMD hump**[1], with overall excellent linearity and top-tier performance[1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Modern flagship AKM stack (AK4499EX×2 + AK4191, XU-316 USB), **nine high-grade dual op-amps**, **CK-03 clocking**, and **two-stage SPDIF PLL**—solid, best-practice engineering rather than a novel architecture[2][3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The **cheapest equivalent** rival is **SMSL SU-10** (dual ES9038PRO, **AES** and **MQA/MQA-CD** feature parity) at **899.99 USD**[5][6].  
**Computation**: 899.99 ÷ 959.99 = **0.94** → cost-performance **0.9**.  
If you don’t specifically prefer the AKM implementation, the SU-10 is the value pick.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

- **Warranty**: Typically **1-year manufacturer** warranty. Some retailers add an extra year (Apos **One-Year Transferable Warranty**)[9], while others have their own policies (Shenzhenaudio; SMSL.shop)[10][11]. Verify with your seller.  
- **Usability**: ASR notes the **front rotary control is stiff/hard to push**; using the included remote is preferable[1].  
- **Firmware/Functions**: Rich feature set including **DSD Direct / “FIXED DSD BYPASS”**[3].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

A pragmatic design focused on **transparent measurements** and **comprehensive connectivity**: dual-mono AKM path plus jitter-reduction (CK-03, dual-stage SPDIF PLL)[2][3]. Minor quirks (tiny Toslink jitter, IMD hump) don’t affect its core value when used via USB[1]. For AKM-centric systems or AES/MQA use-cases, pricing is sensible.

## Advice

- Pick **D400EX** if you want AKM voicing, **AES**, and **MQA/MQA-CD** support[2][3].  
- Pick **SU-10 (899.99 USD)** for the **cheapest** unit with **equal features and measurement class**[5][6].  
- Compare **warranty terms** across retailers[9][10][11].
