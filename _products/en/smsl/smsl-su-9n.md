## Overview

The SMSL SU-9N is a balanced desktop DAC using ESS’s ES9038PRO. Introduced in 2021 as a lower-cost variant of the SU-9, it drops MQA/UAT while retaining high performance, USB (XMOS), optical/coaxial inputs, Bluetooth (LDAC/aptX HD/AAC/SBC), and both XLR and RCA outputs. It supports PCM up to 768 kHz/32-bit and DSD512. [2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Third-party measurements show the SU-9N reaches ≈121 dB SINAD from its balanced outputs, placing it among the top-measuring DACs on Audio Science Review. Frequency response is effectively flat, noise/distortion are well below audibility, and transparency to the source is achieved. [1]  
Manufacturer data (fixed line out): XLR 4.3 Vrms / RCA 2.0 Vrms; THD+N as low as 0.000055% (A-weighted). These figures comfortably exceed audibility thresholds for electronics. [3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design combines a flagship ES9038PRO with an XMOS XU208 USB interface and an optimized low-phase-noise clock implementation. Power is via discrete linear regulation and low-noise rails; Bluetooth supports LDAC at 24-bit/96 kHz. The approach is contemporary and competent, prioritizing measurable performance over boutique features. [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

We compare against the **cheapest product that matches functions (balanced XLR, Bluetooth with LDAC, USB/optical/coax) and transparent measured performance**:

- **Comparator:** SMSL **DO100 PRO** (balanced XLR/RCA, Bluetooth 5.1 with **LDAC**, USB/optical/coax/HDMI-ARC). Street price **219 USD**. [4][6]  
  *Equivalence note:* Same user-facing functions (incl. LDAC BT, balanced outputs) and transparent performance. For measured context, the closely related **DO100** (non-PRO) has been independently tested around the ~120 dB SINAD class on balanced out, i.e., audibly transparent. [5]

**CP = 219 ÷ 399 = 0.55 → 0.6** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Warranty is generally **1 year** on SMSL products. Implementation is retailer-centric (e.g., Parts Express PDF; SMSL web warranty/returns page). SMSL does not indicate a dedicated US repair center; forum reports on after-sales experiences are mixed, so buyers should prefer reputable sellers with clear return handling. Hardware itself is simple (few moving parts). [6][7][8]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Removing MQA/UAT while preserving core fidelity (very low THD+N, wide dynamic range) is a rational, measurement-first cost optimization. The feature set (balanced I/O, LDAC BT, robust USB) aligns with transparent playback requirements rather than marketing flourishes. [1][2][3]

## Advice

If you want **the best measurements at this price**, the SU-9N delivers bona fide transparency with balanced outputs and LDAC Bluetooth. If you prioritize **value with the same functions**, the **DO100 PRO at 219 USD** undercuts it substantially while keeping LDAC and XLR; measured data for the closely related DO100 indicate transparency in practice. [4][5][6]
