## Overview

The SMSL DO100 Pro is a desktop DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) released by Chinese manufacturer SMSL in 2023. Featuring dual ESS ES9039Q2M chips, it achieves world-class measurement performance with a THD+N of 0.00008% (-122dB) and an SNR of 131dB. Supporting PCM 768kHz/32-bit, DSD512, and MQA, plus Bluetooth 5.1 (with LDAC and aptX HD support) and an HDMI ARC input, this comprehensive functionality is offered at approximately 219 USD, embodying the company's design philosophy of "achieving the highest performance at the lowest cost."

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The DO100 Pro's measurement performance is impeccable. With a THD+N of 0.00008% (-122dB), an SNR of 131dB (XLR output), and a dynamic range of 131dB, these values significantly exceed the transparent levels in measurement benchmark tables, achieving completely transparent signal conversion for human hearing. The frequency response is also excellent, staying within ±0.1dB from 20Hz-20kHz, and IMD distortion is kept at a sufficiently low level. Audio Science Review praised it for its "flawless performance" and ranked it among the "top 20 DACs ever measured," warranting an extremely high evaluation for scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The DO100 Pro demonstrates advanced implementation technology with dual ESS ES9039Q2M high-performance DAC chips, a 3rd generation XMOS XU316 USB controller, and six OPA1612 op-amps. Achieving the catalog specifications of chips in an actual product is far from simple, requiring sophisticated technical know-how in power supply design, circuit layout, and ground processing. The fact that the company delivers such performance at this price point proves its excellent implementation technology. However, since it doesn't involve proprietary DAC architecture development, the technology level is rated 0.8.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The DO100 Pro's cost-performance receives a perfect score. Searching worldwide for products with equivalent functionality and performance reveals no cheaper alternatives. As a DAC with a comprehensive feature set including Bluetooth 5.1 (LDAC, aptX HD support), HDMI ARC input, XLR balanced output, MQA support, and DSD512 support, the DO100 Pro is effectively the world's least expensive product. Competitors like the Schiit Modi+ (129 USD), Topping E30 II (149 USD), and FiiO K11 (129 USD) all lack one or more of these key features—such as Bluetooth, HDMI ARC, or XLR balanced output—making them unsuitable as true alternatives. Therefore, the rating is a 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A common issue across SMSL products is concern about reliability and the support infrastructure. Reports of initial firmware bugs (such as pop noises when switching between PCM and DSD) and early failures due to unit variations are sometimes observed. While the warranty period is standard, repairs may require returning the unit to China, with time and costs potentially borne by the user. Compared to traditional brands with domestic support networks, this is a clear weakness, necessitating a low evaluation. A choice must be made between performance and price versus peace of mind.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The DO100 Pro's design philosophy is extremely rational. Its approach of efficiently utilizing the latest components to achieve the clear goal of "transparent measurement performance" while thoroughly eliminating decorative elements that don't contribute to performance is a perfect strategy from a scientific perspective. Beyond its essential DAC functions, the practical feature selection—including Bluetooth connectivity for modern digital audio environments and HDMI ARC input for TV integration—is highly commendable. The pursuit of engineering rationality rather than emotional added value deserves a perfect score.

## Advice

If you want to achieve the highest level of audio quality at the minimum cost in a desktop audio system, the DO100 Pro is currently the most sensible choice. It will demonstrate its true worth to the fullest, particularly in modern listening environments centered on PC audio that also value wireless connectivity and TV integration. Its Bluetooth 5.1 LDAC support enables high-quality wireless playback from smartphones, while the HDMI ARC input allows for high-quality enjoyment of TV audio.

However, there are risks to understand before purchasing. In the event of a malfunction or firmware trouble, comprehensive domestic support cannot be expected. Additionally, firmware instability may be reported in initial production lots. Whether to accept these risks for overwhelming performance and functionality or to choose a more expensive brand with enhanced support depends on your individual values and usage environment. However, when purely weighing audio quality, functionality, and cost, the reality is that no choice surpassing the DO100 Pro currently exists.
