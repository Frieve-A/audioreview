## Overview

The miniDSP UMIK-1 is an omnidirectional USB condenser microphone designed specifically for acoustic measurement. Available since the early 2010s, it has been adopted by a wide range of users from home audio enthusiasts to measurement professionals through integration with measurement software such as Room EQ Wizard (REW) and Dirac Live. With individual calibration file provision and plug-and-play compatibility, it has established itself as a product that meets entry-level to mid-class demands in acoustic measurement.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The UMIK-1 achieves Â±1dB frequency response across the 20Hz-20kHz range with measurement accuracy ensured through individual calibration. The low-noise design of -74dB FS via 24bit/48kHz ADC achieves performance close to transparency levels. However, self-distortion tends to increase above 90dB SPL, and the maximum SPL limitation of 133dB (1% THD) constrains scientific validity in high sound pressure measurements. The automatic recognition function in REW reduces human error in measurement environments, and its contribution to actual acoustic improvement has been confirmed through numerous practical measurement examples.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design using a 6mm electret capsule with USB Audio Class 1 compatibility was advanced for the 2010s era, but is now considered industry-standard configuration. The individual calibration file serial number management system is commendable from a quality control perspective. However, the gap with latest technologies is clear, including improvements in distortion characteristics at high SPL, adoption of higher resolution ADCs (32bit support, etc.), and advanced correction functions through digital signal processing. While the basic design is solid, there is a certain distance from technological innovation and industry-leading standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The miniDSP UMIK-1 is priced at 87 USD. For a calibrated measurement microphone, this is an outstanding price. Comparable products from other manufacturers, such as the Dayton Audio UMM-6 (107 USD) or the Behringer ECM8000 (which requires a separate calibration service for equivalent accuracy), are more expensive. Therefore, the UMIK-1 offers the best cost-performance in its category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

miniDSP has over 10 years of experience as a specialist acoustic measurement equipment manufacturer, and the UMIK-1's quality stability has been proven through long-term continuous sales. Broad OS compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux) via USB Audio Class 1 and official support in major measurement software (REW, Dirac Live) provide high-level usability. However, domestic repair support systems in Japan and firmware update functionality provision have limitations compared to higher-priced products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Ensuring accuracy through individual calibration files and simple measurement environment construction via USB connection represents a rational approach aligned with scientific measurement principles. The design philosophy of achieving low-cost, high-precision acoustic measurement environments through integration with free software like REW is commendable. However, there is room for improvement in addressing the latest measurement technology standards, including limitations during high SPL measurements and non-adoption of higher resolution ADCs. The justification for existence as dedicated equipment is sufficiently proven by performance differences from smartphone built-in microphones and general-purpose USB microphones.

## Advice

The UMIK-1 is a recommendable product for a wide range of applications from individual users starting acoustic measurement to small-to-medium scale professional use. Particularly when considering room correction using REW or Dirac Live, plug-and-play compatibility and individual calibration can achieve both measurement accuracy and convenience. However, for concert hall-level high sound pressure measurements or research applications requiring the highest precision, consider higher-end products like the Earthworks M23. When purchasing, confirming calibration file downloads and REW settings in advance will ensure smooth initial setup.
