summary: "Innovative multichannel measurement microphone array system with advanced A2B technology. However, its 66 dB(A) SNR MEMS capsules sit well below professional measurement expectations; choose it for convenience rather than ultimate precision."

## Overview

The MiniDSP UMIK-X is a USB multichannel measurement microphone array system designed for acoustic measurements and room equalization. Packages include the USB-A2B interface **and** either two or four UMA-4/UMA-XL microphone modules (8–16 mics total), sampling at 24-bit/44.1–48 kHz over Analog Devices A2B. The base package price is **575 USD** for an 8-mic set, with options to expand to 16 channels. A single twisted-pair cable carries audio **and** power up to 40 m. It is UAC-2 compliant and **includes** a Room EQ Wizard (REW) multichannel license with purchase.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The UMIK-X’s microphone modules are specified with **66 dB(A) SNR** and **132.5 dB SPL AOP**. While the high AOP provides ample headroom, a 66 dB(A) SNR falls well below the problematic threshold (≈80 dB) for precision measurement of low-level signals. No third-party comprehensive measurement set (e.g., THD vs SPL) is publicly available for the array as a system, so conclusions rely on manufacturer specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

A2B enables 16-channel audio and power over one twisted pair up to 40 m with daisy-chain topology. Combined with UAC-2, cross-platform support, and native **REW v5.20+ multichannel** compatibility (license included), UMIK-X delivers a forward-looking, highly integrated workflow for distributed measurements that are impractical with single-mic repositioning.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Cost-performance is computed against the **cheapest product that offers equal or better functionality and measurement performance**. We could not identify any cheaper multichannel **measurement** microphone array (4+ calibrated channels, integrated multichannel capture, REW-ready workflow) providing equivalent or better capability. With a base package at **575 USD** for 8 channels, UMIK-X is effectively the floor price for this capability set; therefore CP = **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

MiniDSP provides a one-year warranty. Documentation and community resources are extensive. Historical forum posts show some prior UMIK-1 connectivity failures; while not directly about UMIK-X, they indicate potential variability in user experience. Overall, warranty terms are standard and support channels are established.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design targets objective, repeatable room/acoustic analysis across multiple positions in one pass, minimizing operator error from repositioning. A2B distribution, matched capsules, and REW integration are rational choices that directly improve measurement throughput and usability.

## Advice

Choose UMIK-X when multichannel convenience and repeatability outweigh ultimate low-noise precision. It suits distributed sound-field and multi-sub optimization tasks. For critical low-level work, a higher-SNR single-mic chain may still be preferable; for complex spatial work, UMIK-X’s time savings can dominate.
