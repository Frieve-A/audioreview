## Overview

The MiniDSP SHD Power is a compact Roon Ready streaming integrated amplifier that combines multiple audio functions in a single unit: 2×120W Class D amplification, Dirac Live room correction, DSP processing, and network streaming. Launched by MiniDSP, a company specializing in digital signal processing solutions since 2009, the SHD Power represents an integrated approach to modern audio systems. The unit features a 32-bit floating-point SHARC DSP processor, PCM1795 DAC implementation, and a TPA3255-based Class D amplifier, all housed in a compact 70 × 215 × 225 mm enclosure. 

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Measured performance shows a mix of strengths and limitations. Manufacturer specifications state **THD+N < 0.03% (4Ω)** and **< 0.07% (8Ω)** from 60 mW to 100 W, **SNR > 110 dB** (A-wtd, 1 kHz, 120 W/8Ω), and **crosstalk < −95 dB (1 kHz)**. Independent bench tests (SoundStage! Lab) measured **130 W/8Ω @1% THD**, **149 W/4Ω @1% THD**, **THD+N 0.002–0.008% (100 Hz, 1–100 W)**, and **<0.05% THD+N from 20 Hz–6 kHz (0.6–100 W)**, with frequency response 10 Hz–30 kHz (−0.15/+0.7 dB) and crosstalk −97.1 dB (1 kHz). The DAC path is excellent (manufacturer: **0.0007% THD+N, 120 dB SNR**), while the **<0.07% THD+N (8Ω)** amplifier spec exceeds a **0.01%** transparency threshold, indicating residual distortion above fully transparent levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Integration is the main technical achievement: a 450 MHz SHARC DSP executes mixed-phase **Dirac Live** correction and flexible crossover/matrix processing; a quad-core network platform provides Roon Ready/Volumio streaming; and the on-board 2×120 W power stage eliminates the need for a separate amplifier. The design leverages proven commodity parts (PCM1795 DAC, TPA3255 power stage) rather than novel silicon, keeping the technology level contemporary but not bleeding-edge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Among integrated amplifiers that deliver **Dirac Live**, **network streaming**, and **≥120 W/8Ω continuous two-channel power** without measured-performance inferiority, the **SHD Power is the lowest general-retail price at 1,549 USD**. The closest non-inferior alternative we confirmed is the **Arcam SA35** (Class G, **120 W/8Ω**, Dirac Live, streaming), which typically retails around **3,299 USD**, so SHD Power is normalized to **1.0**.

> Note: Lower-priced AVRs with Dirac Live exist, but they are multichannel products that do not meet our **two-channel non-inferiority** criterion in measured linearity/power relative to SHD Power, so they are excluded as baselines.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

MiniDSP provides a **one-year warranty**. The official support portal handles tickets and RMA; customers are responsible for taxes/duties and, in practice, shipping to the service point. The no-returns policy (“All sales are final”) is stricter than typical hi-fi vendors. Documentation and firmware/Device Console/Dirac Live support mitigate risk for technically confident users, but policy rigidity keeps the score modest.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The product embodies a rational, measurement-driven approach: consolidate streaming, DSP, room correction, and amplification; expose flexible routing/crossover for subwoofer integration; and rely on objective optimization via Dirac Live rather than subjective tuning. The choices clearly trade boutique analog topology for transparent DSP features and setup repeatability.

## Advice

If you specifically need **≥120 W/8Ω** two-channel power and **Dirac Live** in a single streaming chassis, SHD Power offers uniquely strong value at this price. Accept that the amplifier distortion is above a strict transparency cutoff, but note that overall SNR and frequency response are solid, and third-party tests corroborate the rated output. If you do not require 120 W or Dirac, many cheaper streaming amps exist, but they are **not** non-inferior for this target use.
