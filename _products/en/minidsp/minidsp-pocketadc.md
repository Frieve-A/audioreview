## Overview

The miniDSP PocketADC is an extremely compact high-resolution analog-to-digital converter that accepts stereo analog input via RCA connectors and converts to SPDIF coaxial and TOSLINK optical digital outputs. Selectable sample rates of **48/96/192 kHz** are configured via DIP switches, and the unit utilizes an ESS converter chipset with official specifications of **118 dB SNR** and **−114 dB THD+N**. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Measured performance significantly exceeds transparent thresholds across key specifications. S/N ratio of 118 dB substantially surpasses the ~105 dB transparent level, while THD+N of −114 dB (0.0002%) far exceeds the 0.01% threshold. The device supports the full 20 Hz–20 kHz audio band at 24-bit with selectable **48/96/192 kHz** operation, as documented by the manufacturer. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Employs an ESS SABRE converter chipset featuring HyperStream-II–class modulation intended to push timing jitter out of the audio band. Implementation demonstrates competent engineering with appropriate analog–digital integration and a compact form factor—modern and proven rather than bleeding-edge. [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Against the **cheapest product with equal-or-better functionality and measured performance**, the PocketADC offers outstanding value. For a concrete benchmark, **Lynx Hilo 2** provides line-in **THD+N −117 dB** and **122 dB** dynamic range and includes **coax and optical S/PDIF I/O**—meeting or exceeding PocketADC’s role—at an official **3,999 USD** SRP, far above the PocketADC’s price. This satisfies the policy requirement to compare across classes using USD with an equal-or-better alternative. [4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Standard one-year warranty provides basic coverage. The simple, solid-state construction is inherently reliable; miniDSP’s support materials and portal are readily available, though terms are conventional with no extended coverage as standard. [5]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Demonstrates a measurement-driven approach with clearly stated specifications and a practical feature set focused on S/PDIF/TOSLINK digitization without requiring a computer, packaged in a compact enclosure aligned with the performance objective. [1][2]

## Advice

For users requiring verified high-performance analog-to-digital conversion with professional-grade specifications, the PocketADC delivers excellent measured results in a convenient form factor. However, users with basic digitization needs should consider whether the performance premium over generic converters is justified for their use; such devices typically lack the PocketADC’s bandwidth and noise/distortion margins and are **not** equal-or-better substitutes.
