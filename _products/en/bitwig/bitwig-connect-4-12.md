## Overview

Bitwig’s first hardware device, **Connect 4/12**, targets hybrid/modular setups and Bitwig Studio users. It combines a **4-in/12-out** USB interface with **front-panel DC-coupled CV I/O** (2 in / 4 out), **six balanced line outs** plus headphones, and a **360° touch-sensitive dial** with dedicated monitor/transport controls. It records up to **24-bit/192 kHz**, uses **AKM converters**, is **bus-powered** over USB-C (USB 2.0 class-compliant; ASIO for Windows), and weighs about **1.45 kg** [1][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent lab data is limited so far, but manufacturer specs indicate near-transparent performance. Key figures (A-weighted): **Input 1** dynamic range **113 dB**, **THD+N 0.001%**, FR **20 Hz–20 kHz ±0.1 dB**; **Input 2** 112 dB/0.001%; **Inputs 3/4 (CV)** 101 dB/0.007%. **Outputs 1–6** achieve **116 dB** dynamic range with **0.0006% THD+N** and **±0.05 dB** FR; **headphones** 110 dB; **Outputs 9–12 (CV)** 104 dB [3]. With Bitwig devices, CV pitch outs auto-conform to **1 V/Oct** without manual tuning [3]. Overall, on-paper fidelity is strong for its class and use case.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The value lies in workflow integration rather than new conversion tech: front-panel DC-coupled I/O with auto 1 V/Oct range, **Bitwig Mode** (hover-to-control, double-tap to lock), MCU transport, monitor control, and cross-platform class-compliance [1][3]. Lack of ADAT/SPDIF limits channel expansion; otherwise it thoughtfully combines proven technologies to solve hybrid-studio pain points.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

As of Aug 2025, we find **no cheaper finished product** that matches **both** the **functions** (notably **bidirectional CV: 2 DC-coupled inputs + 4 DC-coupled outputs** and integrated monitor/DAW control) **and** the **measured performance**. SSL **12** is cheaper but omits **DC-coupled inputs** and doesn’t reach 12 outputs [4][5]. MOTU **UltraLite-mk5** offers ten DC-coupled outputs and strong measurements but **no DC-coupled inputs** and currently sells for **699.95 USD**, above Connect’s **599 USD** [2][6][7]. Therefore, CP is set to **1.0** (no cheaper equivalent).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This is Bitwig’s first hardware, so long-term field data is pending. Still, the steel chassis, bus-powered design, class-compliance, and an official ASIO driver for Windows are encouraging [1]. Warranty/support routes are documented in the user guide [3]. Compared with long-established interface makers, future repair logistics remain to be proven.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Rather than chasing sheer I/O counts, Connect 4/12 focuses on **hybrid DAW–hardware** realities: **front CV I/O**, **monitor/transport control**, and tight **Bitwig integration**. It’s a coherent solution for its target users, even if it won’t replace expandable multi-preamp recorders.

## Advice

Choose Connect 4/12 if you routinely **send and receive CV** and want integrated **DAW/monitor control** in a single desktop unit. If you need many mic preamps and digital expansion, consider **MOTU UltraLite-mk5** (lots of DC-coupled outs and DSP mixer—but **no CV inputs** and higher price) [6][7]. For CV-centric rigs in Eurorack, **Expert Sleepers** modules (ES-8/ES-9) paired with a standard interface are powerful, though they’re **not** one-box desktop replacements. US street price for Connect is **599 USD** [2]; Japan pricing commonly sits around **99,000円** tax-in [8][9].
