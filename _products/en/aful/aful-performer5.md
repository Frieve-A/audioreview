## Overview

AFUL Performer5 is a 5-driver hybrid in-ear monitor (1DD+4BA) launched in late 2022. It combines AFUL’s RLC Network Frequency Division, a high-precision 3D-printed acoustic tube structure, and a high-damping air-pressure balance system to pursue a smooth, balanced presentation around the 220 USD price point [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specs list **35 Ω impedance**, **110 dB@1 kHz sensitivity**, a **5 Hz–35 kHz** rated bandwidth, and **~26 dB** passive isolation [1]. Independent IEC-711–based measurements show a generally smooth frequency response with modest deviations from strict neutrality and the usual uncertainty above ~8 kHz inherent to coupler measurements [2]. Some third-party commentary notes non-trivial distortion behavior in parts of the midrange, but robust, comparable THD datasets remain limited [3]. Taken together—solid isolation, sensible FR, and sparse THD evidence—the overall measured performance lands at a moderate level for this class.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design employs in-house **RLC frequency-division and correction**, plus a **high-precision 3D-printed multi-tube system** (including an ultra-long bass tube and mid-bass duct) aimed at phase/response control. The **air-pressure balance** scheme targets comfort while preserving bass texture. These mechanisms go beyond typical passive crossovers and generic bores seen at this price [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better option):** **7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2** — detachable **0.78 mm 2-pin** wired IEM with neutral-adjacent tuning and IEC-711 FR traces aligning closely to a modern reference target; user-visible functions match, and measured tonality is not inferior [4][5].  
**Prices (current market):** Performer5 **219.99 USD** (official store) [1]; Zero:2 **24.99 USD** (official retailer) [4].  
**Calculation:** **24.99 USD ÷ 219.99 USD = 0.1136 → 0.1** (rounded to the first decimal place).  
Performer5 may justify a premium for build/fit and its proprietary acoustic engineering, but strictly by “what percent of the price buys equivalent user-relevant performance,” Zero:2 is the lowest-cost qualifying alternative.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

No widespread reliability defects are documented. AFUL lists the Performer5 on its official store and routes practical support through sellers; typical warranty terms for IEMs are **1 year** at major retailers [1]. Build quality (resin shells, 0.78 mm 2-pin) appears competent; long-term failure-rate data remain limited given product age.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AFUL’s approach—electrical correction (RLC), controlled acoustic path lengths via 3D-printed tubes, and pressure management—directly targets common hybrid pitfalls (phase integration, nozzle resonances, comfort). The emphasis on a smooth, peak-controlled response is consistent with evidence-based tuning priorities [1][2].

## Advice

Performer5 suits listeners prioritizing a cohesive, fatigue-free tonality with strong isolation and who value AFUL’s engineering approach. If your goal is maximum performance-per-dollar with equivalent user-facing functions and neutral-adjacent FR, **7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2** is the cheapest proven alternative and drives the CP score.
