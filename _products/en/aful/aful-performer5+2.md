## Overview

AFUL Performer5+2 (also referred to by the brand as “Performer 7”) is a 7-driver tribrid IEM: dual 6 mm dynamic drivers, four balanced-armature drivers, and one micro planar driver. It was introduced in 2024 and targets the 239 USD segment with AFUL’s RLC crossover and 3D-printed acoustic structures; the company highlights independent lab work and patents behind these designs [2][4]. AFUL states its S&E-Math approach has been recognized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, alongside local government R&D support [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Key published specifications are 15 Ω impedance, 109 dB @ 1 kHz sensitivity, and a stated 10 Hz–35 kHz response band (manufacturer data) [2]. Independent 5128 measurements show a modern, target-adjacent frequency response with a controlled sub-bass lift and restrained upper-mid/treble energy, consistent with balanced tonality for general listening [1]. Public THD data for this exact model are not available at time of writing; given the solid third-party FR evidence but incomplete distortion/isolation data, we assess scientific validity at 0.7.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The 7-driver tribrid topology with an RLC-based crossover network and 3D-printed Y-shaped acoustic tubing is advanced for the price and is documented by the manufacturer [2]. AFUL also documents in-house measurement capability and an R&D program (“S&E-Math”) that has received recognition and funding support [3]. The micro planar super-tweeter alongside dual DD bass and BA mids is a technically ambitious arrangement for this bracket.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** TRUTHEAR HEXA, 89.99 USD (major retailer) [6].  
**Why equivalent-or-better:** wired IEM with detachable cable (same user-facing function set), and third-party lab testing reports neutral/accurate frequency response with low distortion and good channel matching—meeting or exceeding core audible measurements relevant to fidelity [5].

**Calculation (USD basis, current product price 239 USD):**

Cost-Performance = 89.99 / 239 = 0.376 → score 0.4

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

AFUL has an increasing track record since 2018 with global retail distribution. For this passive IEM there is no firmware aspect. Warranty terms and service channels are handled via AFUL and retailers; specific international warranty duration is not clearly stated on the product page [2], so we provisionally score support at 0.5 pending broader longitudinal data.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AFUL positions engineering-led, measurable improvements (multi-driver division with RLC integration, acoustic tubing, and documented R&D) rather than unverifiable claims [2][3]. The design choices map to measurable axes (FR shaping/driver integration) and are aligned with objective high-fidelity goals, warranting a high rationality score.

## Advice

Choose Performer5+2 if you want an objectively balanced, sub-bass-supported tuning delivered by a sophisticated tribrid architecture and are comfortable paying a premium for AFUL’s engineering package. If your priority is **value at similar measured fidelity**, consider **TRUTHEAR HEXA (89.99 USD)** as a strong alternative grounded in third-party measurement [5][6].
