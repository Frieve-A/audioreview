## Overview

The AFUL MagicOne is an in-ear monitor developed by AFUL, a Chinese audio manufacturer established in 2018. This product is a technical-challenge piece that utilizes the company's proprietary SE-Math electro-acoustic intermodulation technology and Nautilus acoustic labyrinth technology to achieve full-range reproduction from 5Hz-25kHz with a single custom balanced armature (BA) driver. The transparent 3D-printed resin shell allows a view of the internal structure, which features a distinctive acoustic design with a 77mm ultra-thin acoustic tube. It is positioned as a model that showcases AFUL's technical capabilities.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The MagicOne receives a moderate rating for its measured performance. The nominal specifications—a frequency response of 5Hz-25kHz, an impedance of 32Ω, and a sensitivity of 103dB/mW—are reasonable, but crucial third-party measurement data for THD, SNR, and crosstalk are limited. The claimed passive noise isolation of 26dB does not reach the policy's excellent level (30dB or higher) but surpasses the problematic level (10dB or lower), indicating intermediate performance. While the concept of full-range reproduction with a single BA driver is technically interesting, the lack of data to objectively assess its acoustic transparency limits its score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The MagicOne demonstrates noteworthy technical innovation. Its SE-Math electro-acoustic intermodulation technology is a proprietary approach that compensates for discrepancies between the driver and acoustic output using an RLC electro-acoustic network. The Nautilus acoustic labyrinth technology, inspired by renowned loudspeakers, employs a 77mm ultra-thin acoustic tube designed to extend low-frequency response. The combination of a custom-designed wide-range BA driver and a precision 3D-printed acoustic structure is a rational and highly commendable engineering solution to the technical challenge of single-driver full-range reproduction.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At its current market price of 140 USD, multiple alternatives offer comparable or superior acoustic performance at a lower cost. As a comparison with a single product could be skewed, we calculate an average based on several well-regarded, high-value products with different configurations. These include the Moondrop Chu II (18 USD), Truthear Hexa (71 USD), and KZ ZSN Pro X (22 USD). Their respective CP values are `18/140=0.13`, `71/140=0.51`, and `22/140=0.16`. The average of these values is approximately 0.27, which rounds to a score of 0.3. While its innovative technology is recognized, its price competitiveness is a significant issue.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

AFUL, established in 2018, is a relatively new manufacturer but has a track record of systematic technical development and patent acquisition. It offers a standard 1-year manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials, components, and workmanship. Support is primarily provided through distributors, and a global direct support system is limited. Due to its emerging status, long-term reliability data is scarce, leading to an industry-average rating.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The MagicOne's design approach is scientifically rational. It pursues acoustic engineering solutions to address the technical constraints of full-range reproduction using a single BA driver. The SE-Math technology is an electro-acoustic compensation system with a theoretical basis, and the Nautilus acoustic labyrinth is an application of proven acoustic principles. The use of precision 3D printing and patented technologies represents a rational investment in measurable acoustic improvement. Its development approach, which avoids unscientific claims, is commendable, but demonstrating a clear advantage over multi-driver designs remains a future challenge.

## Advice

The MagicOne is a product for audio enthusiasts who are fascinated by its technical background. It can be recommended if you are interested in the acoustic engineering challenge of a single BA driver, but for users focused on cost-performance, considering alternatives is strongly advised. More practical choices include the Truthear Hexa (71 USD) for proven performance, or the Moondrop Chu II (18 USD) for those on a tighter budget. For those seeking pure acoustic performance for the price, selecting a more established alternative would be the rational decision.
