## Overview

The Avantgarde Acoustic META PRIMO represents a single-box all-horn speaker system from the German manufacturer specializing in high-efficiency horn loudspeaker technology. Originally priced at 65,000 USD, this model featured a configuration of one tweeter horn, one midrange horn with Alnico magnets, and two active bass horns in an integrated design. The product aimed to deliver "ideal low frequencies in limited space" with an "elegant single form" that challenged traditional horn speaker concepts. The system operated on 100V power specification and included premium accessories such as FURUTECH JumperCable Set and MITSUBISHI PC-1 PowerCable. However, this model has since been discontinued and is no longer in production.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. No credible third-party measurements for frequency response deviation, THD, S/N ratio, or other key performance indicators were found for the META PRIMO model specifically. While general Avantgarde specifications indicate sensitivity exceeding 107 dB and frequency range of 18-22,000 Hz for similar models, and related products show typical impedance of 18ฮฉ, no specific measurement data exists for the META PRIMO's frequency response, harmonic distortion, or signal-to-noise ratio. Following framework guidelines for products with unavailable credible measurement data, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 with explicit notation that evaluation cannot be completed due to insufficient data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The META PRIMO demonstrates high technology level through several advanced implementations. The product incorporates proprietary iTRON technology with patented voltage/current converter systems, representing novel approaches subject to multiple US and German patents. The in-house design by Avantgarde Acoustic showcases specialized expertise in spherical horn design and coplanar alignment technology. The horn technology with high efficiency is technically desirable and followed by other manufacturers, while the specialized know-how in horn acoustics and patented iTRON system creates competitive advantages requiring years for competitors to replicate. The modular design allows future technological upgrades, demonstrating forward-thinking engineering. The appropriate combination of digital signal processing with traditional horn acoustics represents sophisticated technology integration, though the approach remains primarily analog/mechanical rather than incorporating cutting-edge digital integration.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The META PRIMO at 65,000 USD provides single-box speaker system with active bass horn amplification and high-efficiency design. The closest equivalent-or-better product identified is the Klipsch Jubilee at 39,600 USD (pair). Equipped with active DSP crossover and sensitivity 105dB are equivalent-or-better. CP = 39,600 USD รท 65,000 USD = 0.6. The Klipsch system provides comparable functionality through active DSP crossover, matching the META PRIMO's core capabilities at a significantly lower price point.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Horn speakers demonstrate inherently simple, robust design with fewer failure-prone components compared to conventional multi-driver systems. Avantgarde Acoustic maintains a global support system as a German manufacturer with established high-end audio track record. North American distribution operates through Audio Pathways Inc. in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada. The modular design allows future technological upgrades and facilitates easier service access. However, the META PRIMO appears to be discontinued, potentially limiting future support and parts availability. While the company continues operations with current product lines, discontinued model status reduces long-term service prospects. The manufacturer provides product identification guidance, downloadable manuals, warranty extension through registration, and maintains support contact methods including phone and email channels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Avantgarde Acoustic's design philosophy demonstrates rational approach through integration of measurement-based optimization via DSP and digital crossover technology. The coplanar alignment system ensures precise sound reproduction by maintaining identical acoustic center distances to listeners. Advanced integration combines traditional horn acoustics with modern digital signal processing, while proprietary iTRON voltage/current converter technology represents meaningful innovation. The spherical horn design with modular technology enabling future upgrades shows innovative attitude toward long-term product evolution. However, the high price point of 65,000 USD shows unclear direct correlation between costs and measurable performance improvements. The company's motto "Purity meets Performance" aligns with measurement-focused approaches, though the extreme pricing suggests significant costs unrelated to function and measurement performance. DSP integration and patented technologies contribute directly to performance capabilities, supporting rational engineering direction.

## Advice

For potential purchasers, the META PRIMO is no longer available as it has been discontinued. Those interested in similar horn speaker technology should consider current Avantgarde Acoustic models such as the ZERO iTRON or investigate the recommended alternative Klipsch Jubilee, which provides equivalent functionality at significantly lower cost. Given the high price point and discontinued status, prospective buyers might explore other high-efficiency horn systems from active manufacturers. The lack of third-party measurement data makes objective performance comparison difficult, emphasizing the importance of audition before purchase for any high-end horn system. Consider ongoing support requirements and parts availability when evaluating discontinued high-end audio products.
