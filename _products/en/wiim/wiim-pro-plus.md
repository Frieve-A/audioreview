## Overview

WiiM Pro Plus is an intermediate music streamer from WiiM brand under China's LinkPlay Technology. At 219 USD, it incorporates AKM4493SEQ Velvet Sound DAC, achieving transparency-level measurements of SNR 120dB, THD+N -110dB (0.00032%). Supporting 32bit/768kHz PCM and DSD512, with Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, and Room Correction functionality. This product completely revolutionized the entry-level music streamer market by delivering high-performance DAC integration previously impossible at this price point.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

WiiM Pro Plus achieves transparency-level measurement performance. The AKM4493SEQ DAC realizes SNR 120dB, THD+N -110dB (0.00032%), achieving distortion rates well below audible thresholds. Supporting 32bit/768kHz PCM and DSD512 completely covers the human auditory range, with frequency response achieving flatness within ±0.1dB across 44.1kHz-192kHz. These figures are equivalent to products in 5x+ price ranges, providing scientifically clear benefits. However, the maximum 2V RMS analog output may present limitations when connecting to some high-end equipment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

WiiM Pro Plus technical level is extremely high considering its price point. The AKM4493SEQ DAC employs the latest Velvet Sound technology from Asahi Kasei Electronics, offering six selectable digital filter types. Ultra-low noise clock circuitry and improved power supply design achieve low distortion rates previously impossible in this price category. Wi-Fi 6 support and Room Correction function implementation are also technically excellent. However, it fundamentally depends on AKM DAC chip performance, with no proprietary analog circuit design or innovative technology development evident.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

WiiM Pro Plus cost performance is at an abnormal level. At 219 USD with AKM4493SEQ DAC, SNR 120dB, THD+N -110dB performance, equivalent standalone DACs alone cost 400 USD+, making this price including streamer functionality exceptional. Compared to closest competitor Cambridge Audio MXN10 (399 USD), it offers superior measurement performance while being 45% cheaper. At 80 USD less than Bluesound Node Nano (299 USD) while significantly exceeding DAC performance. Price realization through Chinese manufacturing and LinkPlay mass production technology represents levels impossible for traditional manufacturers.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

WiiM Pro Plus reliability is good for a Chinese manufacturer product. Quality control is stable through LinkPlay's OEM experience with major manufacturers, with high third-party evaluations including What Hi-Fi Awards 2024 winner, and low initial failure rates. Firmware updates are provided monthly with continuous feature improvements. The 1-year warranty is brief but reasonable considering the 219 USD price. However, long-term parts supply and support continuity remain unclear aspects of an emerging brand.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

WiiM Pro Plus design philosophy is extremely rational. By adopting high-performance AKM DAC chip and achieving transparency levels through measurements, it scientifically guarantees sound quality. At 219 USD price achieving 32bit/768kHz and DSD512 support provides sufficient necessity as dedicated equipment. Integration of analog/digital inputs/outputs, Room Correction functionality, and multi-room support offers functions difficult to achieve with standalone DAC plus PC connection. The cost-focused design without compromising measurement performance is particularly rational.

## Advice

WiiM Pro Plus is the most recommendable product in the current entry-level streamer market. No other product exists offering AKM4493SEQ DAC with transparency-level measurements at 219 USD. For purchase consideration, it should be viewed as the only technically irreplaceable choice at this price point. However, with maximum analog output of 2V RMS, volume insufficiency may occur when paired with some high-end preamplifiers. Additionally, as an emerging brand, support continuity after 5 years is uncertain, but considering current performance and price, this remains an extremely excellent choice even accounting for that concern. Particularly for measurement-focused users seeking cost performance, there is no need to consider other options.
