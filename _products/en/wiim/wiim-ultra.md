## Overview

WiiM Ultra is the flagship integrated streamer-preamp from WiiM brand under China's LinkPlay Technology. At 329 USD, it combines ES9038Q2M DAC achieving transparency-level measurements of SNR 121dB, THD+N -116dB (0.00018%) with 3.5-inch touchscreen, HDMI ARC, MM phono input, subwoofer output, and headphone output integration. Featuring Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, and Room Correction functionality, it represents an innovative product realizing all necessary functions for dedicated audio equipment in a single unit.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

WiiM Ultra measurement performance significantly exceeds transparency levels. The ES9038Q2M DAC achieves SNR 121dB, THD+N -116dB (0.00018%), and frequency response Â±0.05dB, realizing distortion rates far below human auditory limits. Headphone output also delivers excellent SNR 119dB, THD+N -99dB, with 32bit/384kHz PCM support completely covering the audible range. These figures are equivalent to or better than dedicated DACs in 10x+ price ranges, providing scientifically clear and measurable benefits. Particularly excellent is maintaining high measurement performance across all multiple inputs and outputs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

WiiM Ultra technical level is very high for an integrated product. The combination of ES9038Q2M DAC and TPA6120A2 headphone amplifier represents industry-standard implementation. System integration technology including 3.5-inch touchscreen integration, HDMI ARC support, Room Correction functionality, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 wireless implementation is extremely high-level. Particularly, built-in phono preamplifier and complete digital/analog input/output integration solves technically challenging problems. However, the DAC chip itself is off-the-shelf, with limited proprietary circuit design technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

WiiM Ultra cost performance is extremely high with abnormal pricing for an integrated product. No other product exists at 329 USD integrating ES9038Q2M DAC, preamplifier, phono preamplifier, headphone amplifier, touchscreen, and Room Correction functionality. Assembling equivalent functionality separately requires: Cambridge Audio MXN10 (399 USD) + phono preamplifier (200 USD) + headphone amplifier (200 USD) for minimum 800 USD+, making Ultra's functional integration overwhelmingly superior in cost performance. Price setting maximally leverages Chinese manufacturing cost reduction benefits.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

WiiM Ultra reliability is good for an integrated product. Despite complex functional integration, quality remains stable through LinkPlay manufacturing experience, with high evaluations from What Hi-Fi Awards supporting reliability. While failure risk increases with additional components like touchscreen, no significant quality issues are currently reported. Firmware updates are active with continuous feature improvements. However, 1-year warranty is brief, and long-term reliability of complex systems remains unclear for an emerging brand.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

WiiM Ultra design philosophy is extremely rational, realizing the ideal form of dedicated audio equipment. It perfectly integrates elements necessary for modern audio systems: ensuring transparency-level measurement performance, integrating all required functions, intuitive touchscreen operation, and TV integration through HDMI ARC support. Room Correction functionality solves acoustic problems, phono input accommodates analog records, and headphone output enables personal listening. Integrating all these at 329 USD completely establishes necessity as dedicated equipment. Functional integration impossible with general-purpose equipment makes the design philosophy ideal.

## Advice

WiiM Ultra is the most recommendable product in the current streamer-preamp market. No other product exists at 329 USD achieving transparency-level measurement performance, perfect functional integration, and touchscreen operation, with overwhelming cost performance. Particularly, integrating streaming, preamplifier, phono preamplifier, headphone amplifier, and Room Correction functionality in a single device realizes significant cost reduction and convenience improvement compared to traditional separate component combinations. For purchase consideration, this is the only technically irreplaceable choice at this price point. Even considering emerging brand support continuity risks, current functional, performance, and price advantages are overwhelming, making this an unhesitatingly recommendable product.
