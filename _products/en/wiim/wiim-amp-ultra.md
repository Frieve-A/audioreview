## Overview

The WiiM Amp Ultra is a streaming integrated amplifier delivering 100W per channel at 8Ω with ESS ES9039Q2M SABRE DAC and dual TI TPA3255 Class-D amplifiers. Features include a 3.5-inch glass touchscreen, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, HDMI ARC support, and proprietary Post Filter Feedback technology for load-independent performance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third-party measurements from Erin's Audio Corner [1] show SINAD of approximately 87dB at 5W/4Ω, corresponding to THD+N of approximately 0.0044%, demonstrating excellent distortion performance at practical output levels. Frequency response deviation ≤0.10dB shows excellent load stability. Dynamic range measures approximately 100dB, and damping factor is 94. Manufacturer-specified S/N ratio is ≥120dB [2]. Key distortion and frequency response metrics achieve transparent-level performance, while dynamic range and damping factor approach but do not fully reach transparent thresholds.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Amp Ultra demonstrates competent system integration using standard licensed components. ESS ES9039Q2M DAC provides 32-bit/384kHz capability, while dual TI TPA3255 amplifiers deliver 100W/200W output at 8Ω/4Ω respectively. Proprietary PFFB implementation and advanced streaming integration show engineering capability, though core technologies offer limited competitive differentiation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The WiiM Amp Ultra is currently available at 529 USD [3]. CP = 1.0 (no cheaper equivalent-or-better product exists). After comprehensive search across streaming integrated amplifier candidates, no products were found with equivalent-or-better measured performance and user-facing functions at lower price. The WiiM Amp Ultra represents the best available option combining touchscreen interface, RoomFit EQ, and 100W power output in its performance class.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Global manufacturer support available through multiple channels with regular firmware updates addressing connectivity and playback issues. Standard 1-year warranty extends to 2 years in EU markets. Complex design with multiple electronic components balanced by active support infrastructure and documented issue resolution history through firmware improvements.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

WiiM demonstrates exemplary measurement-focused scientific approach, explicitly stating "extremely rational" philosophy of "achieving transparency levels through measurement values." Cost allocation prioritizes performance components (premium ESS DAC, dual amplifiers, PFFB technology) over aesthetics. Modern efficient design with DSP room correction, advanced wireless standards, and demonstrable load-independent performance benefits.

## Advice

The WiiM Amp Ultra suits users seeking a measurement-focused streaming amplifier with modern connectivity features. Excellent choice for digital sources requiring touchscreen control and room correction. Strong consideration for those prioritizing objective performance metrics. Users requiring analog inputs or higher power output should consider alternatives. The combination of features and measured performance represents exceptional value in the streaming amplifier category.
