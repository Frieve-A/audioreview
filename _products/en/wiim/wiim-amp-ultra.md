## Overview

WiiM Amp Ultra is a streaming amplifier launched in June 2025, combining 200W at 4Ω Class-D amplification with an ESS ES9039Q2M SABRE DAC and a 3.5-inch touchscreen. It’s built on dual TI TPA3255 with post-filter feedback (PFFB), and integrates HDMI ARC, multi-room, Room EQ/PEQ, and **Roon Ready** support in a compact aluminum chassis. [2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Third-party measurements show transparent-class results at typical listening power: at 5W into 4Ω, SINAD ≈ **87 dB** (THD+N ≈ **0.0044%**), with flat frequency response (≈ **±0.1 dB** 20 Hz–20 kHz). Continuous power meets **~100 W/8Ω** and **~200 W/4Ω** ratings. Manufacturer lists **SNR 120 dB (A-weighted)** and **impedance range 2–8Ω**; treat these as specs until independently verified. Overall, distortion and linearity clear the transparency thresholds; noise/crosstalk data are adequate in practice but less completely documented than distortion/power. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Premium ESS ES9039Q2M DAC, dual TPA3255 with PFFB, and multiple OPA1612 stages deliver modern, load-independent behavior. Software features include 24 preset EQs, 10-band PEQ, room correction, and broad protocol support, presented via a responsive 3.5-inch capacitive touchscreen with a customizable UI.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Using the policy’s “cheapest equivalent-or-better” rule: the lowest-cost way to obtain the same **functions** (streaming with HDMI ARC, PEQ/room correction, touchscreen control) and **measured performance** (≥200 W/4Ω, THD+N ≤0.01%) is **AIYIMA A70 (199 USD, manufacturer PFFB amp ≥200 W/4Ω)** + **WiiM Ultra (329 USD, streamer with HDMI ARC, PEQ/room correction, touchscreen)** = **528 USD**. Against the review target **529 USD**, the ratio is **528 USD ÷ 529 USD = 0.998 → round to 1.0**. Rationale: Ultra supplies the identical user-facing streaming/ARC/EQ/touchscreen set; A70 meets or exceeds output power and distortion specs. [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Warranty is **region-dependent (~1–2 years)**; firmware cadence is active with ongoing feature and stability updates across WiiM devices. Simple Class-D power stage and solid enclosure aid durability; software support history is favorable. [6][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Design choices (PFFB, high-performance DAC, integrated DSP/room EQ) directly target measured transparency while consolidating use-case friction (HDMI ARC, app control, touchscreen). Cost is focused on functions that move the measurement needle; no reliance on non-auditable “tweaks.”

## Advice

Choose WiiM Amp Ultra when you want a **single-box** streamer/amp with HDMI ARC, room correction, and a front-panel touchscreen. If you’re comfortable with two boxes, **WiiM Ultra + AIYIMA A70** achieves equivalent user functions and equal-or-better core measurements at essentially the same cost, trading integration for flexibility.
