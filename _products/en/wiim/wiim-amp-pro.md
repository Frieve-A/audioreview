## Overview

WiiM Amp Pro (2024) is a compact all-in-one streaming amplifier that integrates TI's TPA3255 power stage, an ESS ES9038Q2M DAC, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, HDMI ARC, sub out, and app-based room correction. The aluminum chassis measures 8.54" × 7.48" × 2.60" (217 × 190 × 66 mm). [2][4][5]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent community measurements report roughly **~100 dB SINAD around 5 W**, with distortion rising at very high frequencies and near full power yet remaining transparent in normal use. [1]  
Manufacturer specifications list **SNR 120 dB (A-weighted)** and **THD+N -105 dB (0.0005%) @ 5 W**, plus PFFB and room correction. These specs exceed common transparency thresholds but are treated as manufacturer data. [2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Modern wireless (Wi-Fi 6E, BT 5.3), HDMI ARC, in-app room correction, and a PFFB implementation on a TPA3255 platform constitute a current, practical design using proven silicon rather than proprietary architectures. [2][5]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Current market price: 379 USD.** [3][10]

We sought the **cheapest product with equal-or-better user-facing functions (HDMI ARC, integrated streaming with multi-room, app EQ/room correction) *and* comparable transparent measured performance (~100 dB SINAD class)**. As of 2025-09-01, none cheaper than the review target was found:

- **Bluesound Powernode Edge** (streaming amp with HDMI eARC): **649 USD MSRP**. Not cheaper. [7]  
- **Sonos Amp** (streaming amp with HDMI ARC): **699 USD**. Not cheaper. [8]

We also checked entry AVRs that include **eARC + integrated streaming + room correction** (e.g., **Denon AVR-S660H**; general retail often **339-499 USD**), but **independent transparency data at the ~100 dB SINAD level is not established**, so they do not qualify as "not inferior" in measured performance for this comparison. [11][12]

Therefore CP remains **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Warranty coverage via an official Canadian distributor shows **1-year** as typical; policies vary by region/retailer. Firmware activity and an active community are positives, but long-term failure statistics for this model are limited. Score anchored at average (0.5) with +0.1 for simple, low-wear Class-D design. [9][5]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Design choices target audible transparency and practicality: PFFB to reduce load interaction, software EQ/room correction, and comprehensive streaming/ARC integration in one box. This is a measurement-first, user-centric approach. [2][5]

## Advice

If you want a tidy, **single-box** solution to power passive speakers with modern streaming, HDMI ARC, and room correction, Amp Pro is an easy recommendation at **379 USD**. Alternatives with the same feature scope are significantly pricier and do not offer clearly superior measured transparency. [3][7][8]
