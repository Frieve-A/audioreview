## Overview

WiiM Pro is an entry-level network audio streamer positioned as a budget gateway to hi-res streaming at **149 USD**. It supports **AirPlay 2, Google Cast (Chromecast built-in), Spotify Connect, TIDAL Connect, Alexa Cast, DLNA and Roon Ready**, and offers **optical/coaxial in/out and analog in/out** with **bit-perfect 24-bit/192 kHz** on digital outputs [1]. 

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent measurements reported **~85.4 dB SINAD** for the analog line out (≈**0.005% THD+N** derived from SINAD), placing the analog stage **right around the audibility/“transparent” border by distortion**; as a **digital transport** the unit is effectively transparent [3]. Manufacturer specs list **THD+N −92 dB (0.0025%)** and **SNR 106 dB** for analog out, digital I/O up to **192 kHz/24-bit**, and ADC on line-in fixed at **48 kHz/16-bit** [1]. In practice, using the Pro’s digital outputs into a competent external DAC yields transparent playback; its internal DAC is serviceable but not state-of-the-art.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design uses a **TI PCM5121** DAC and a mainstream streaming SoC with extensive protocol support (AirPlay 2, Chromecast, Roon Ready, Alexa/Google/Siri voice hooks, multi-room, EQ/room correction) [1][4]. The feature set is strong for the price but not novel enough to merit a higher technology score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At **149 USD** (current U.S. market price) [2], **no single cheaper product matches the same user-facing functions**—**AirPlay 2 + Google Cast + Roon Ready**—with **both optical/coaxial digital outputs and inputs** and **bit-perfect 24/192** capability [1][4]. For example, **Arylic LP10** is cheaper at **99 USD** but **lacks Roon Ready** and therefore is **not equivalent** in functions despite having AirPlay 2/Chromecast and digital out [5]. Accordingly, CP is set to **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

WiiM provides ongoing firmware updates via the WiiM Home app and maintains active documentation/community support, which is typical at this price level [1]. Long-term field reliability data are still limited for the brand.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing protocol breadth, stable software, and wide I/O while keeping costs low is a rational approach. WiiM Pro offers transparent digital transport performance and “good-enough” analog for budget systems without paying for boutique hardware that yields no measurable benefit.

## Advice

Use **digital out (optical/coax)** to an external DAC if your system prioritizes measured transparency. Take advantage of the extensive **native casting (AirPlay 2/Chromecast/Spotify/TIDAL)** and **Roon Ready** support. Note that **line-in is converted at 48 kHz/16-bit**—fine for casual sources but not ideal for archival-grade digitization [1].
