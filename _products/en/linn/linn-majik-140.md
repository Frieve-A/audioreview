## Overview

The Linn Majik 140 is a four-way, ported floorstanding loudspeaker featuring a 0.75" fabric-dome supertweeter, 1.17" polyurethane elastomer-dome tweeter, and dual 6.5" drivers in separate enclosures. Introduced at 2,995 USD per pair, it represents Linn's mid-tier offering with the company's 2K tweeter-supertweeter array technology. The speaker can be configured for single-, bi-, tri-, or quad-wiring/amping configurations.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Third-party measurements reveal significant performance limitations. Stereophile measurements show voltage sensitivity of 88.1 dB/2.83 V/m, conforming to specifications [1]. However, impedance drops to a problematic 2.5 Ω minimum around 138 Hz with challenging phase angles, requiring amplifiers rated for 4 Ω loads. The frequency response exhibits a concerning suckout in the tweeter's in-band behavior, described as worse than the smaller Majik 109 with suboptimal crossover integration [1]. A high-Q cabinet resonance near 453 Hz was detected on all panels. While bass extension reaches ~40 Hz with useful output near 32 Hz and woofer distortion remains low, the midrange/treble anomalies keep performance below transparent levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Majik 140 employs a conventional four-way layout with Linn’s 2K tweeter–supertweeter array covering 1.5–6 kHz and >6 kHz respectively. The polyurethane-elastomer dome tweeter and separate sealed/ported mid-bass chambers are competent but not cutting-edge. Contemporary advances such as metamaterial absorption, next-gen motor topology, or integrated DSP are absent.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Per policy, cost-performance must compare against the **cheapest** product that is **equal or better** in features and **measured** performance, regardless of brand/class. As of August 24, 2025, the **Klipsch RP-6000F II** is widely available at **699.99 USD each** (1,399.98 USD per pair) from multiple U.S. retailers, with independent Klippel NFS data demonstrating good linearity and bass extension (-6 dB ≈ 45 Hz) [2][3][4]. This meets the “not inferior” criterion versus the Majik 140 on core metrics while providing equivalent user-facing function (passive floorstanding stereo).  
**CP = 1,399.98 USD ÷ 2,995 USD = 0.5.**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Linn offers standard warranty terms and a global dealer network. The straightforward passive design with discrete driver chambers suggests good long-term reliability. Availability appears limited in some regions, which may affect future serviceability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The 4-way architecture and complex wiring options aren’t justified by the measured outcomes. Given modern 2-/3-way designs achieving higher objective performance at lower prices, the added complexity yields little real-world benefit here.

## Advice

If you’re shopping in this category, prioritize models with published, independent NFS/CTA-2034 data. A clear example is the **Klipsch RP-6000F II (1,399.98 USD/pair)**, which delivers equal-or-better measured performance and broader availability at far lower cost [2][3][4]. For greater output while retaining strong measurements, the **Klipsch RP-8000F II** is another option, though typically priced slightly higher per pair.
