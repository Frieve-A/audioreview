## Overview

The Allen & Heath WZ4 14:4:2 is a professional 14-channel analog mixer specialized for live sound applications. Designed to handle both FOH (Front of House) and monitor duties, it features 10 mic/line inputs and 2 stereo channels. With 4 group buses and 2 matrix outputs, plus 6 auxiliary sends for flexible routing capabilities, it's part of the company's MixWizard4 series, emphasizing reliability and build quality for professional environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measurement performance is extremely excellent. The THD is 0.004% (10dBu, 1kHz), and the frequency response is ±0.5dB over 20Hz-50kHz, both of which achieve a transparent level that completely exceeds the human audible range. Specifications such as a microphone preamp EIN of -127dB, an overall mixer noise floor below -96dBu, and crosstalk exceeding 90dB (1kHz) also meet ideal values from an acoustic engineering perspective, ensuring the highest level of fidelity to the sound source. The maximum output level of +26dBu provides ample headroom, and there are no factors that would become a bottleneck in sound quality from a scientific viewpoint.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design incorporates practical audio processing features including a 4-band EQ with 2 sweepable mid-bands and an 80Hz high-pass filter at 12dB/octave. Low-noise microphone preamps and the QCC (Quick Connection Console) system offer flexible installation options, representing solid technical implementation. However, the approach remains a fundamentally traditional analog circuit combination without revolutionary technical elements. The optional USB board for multi-channel recording is contemporary but represents an industry-standard level of technology. Overall, it maintains a competent technical standard but lacks cutting-edge innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At a market price of 1,653 USD (as of July 2025), there are more capable and less expensive digital mixers available. For example, the Behringer X AIR XR18 features 18 inputs, 6 AUX buses, built-in effects, and USB multitrack recording capabilities for a price of 563 USD. The calculation is: 563 USD ÷ 1,653 USD = 0.34. This means a functionally superior product can be obtained for about 34% of the cost. The absence of physical faders is a difference in operational style, not a functional inferiority. Unless one finds specific value in the analog feel, digital mixers are overwhelmingly superior in terms of performance-to-price ratio, leading to a low cost-performance rating for this product.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Allen & Heath is a respected British manufacturer with over 50 years of history and a proven reputation for reliability in professional environments. The MixWizard4 series is widely deployed in live venues globally, demonstrating robust construction and long-term stability. The company provides a 3-year product warranty and a worldwide support network, with authorized repair services available in Japan through official distributors. Product failure rates are below the industry average, with many units demonstrating 10+ years of operation under proper maintenance. The analog design eliminates firmware update requirements, avoiding long-term compatibility issues.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The FOH/monitor dual-purpose design concept aligns with practical field requirements, representing a rational approach. The low-noise design and ample headroom, which contribute to its measurement performance, demonstrate a scientifically sound direction. However, the utilization of digital technology is limited, and it lacks modern approaches like DSP for advanced signal processing or wireless control. While the direction of achieving transparent sound quality through analog circuitry is rational, its necessity as a dedicated analog machine is diminishing, as digital mixers at or below the same price point offer more functionality at a lower cost. The design philosophy is generally rational but lacks price-disrupting innovation.

## Advice

This product offers top-tier measurement performance and high reliability, making it suitable for professional environments where the physical, tactile control of an analog mixer is desired. However, from a cost-performance perspective, it is not a rational choice. For the same price or less, digital mixers like the Behringer X AIR XR18 offer far more channels, powerful built-in effects, wireless control, and multitrack recording capabilities. Unless there is an absolute requirement for the intuitive hands-on control of physical faders and knobs, or a specific need to integrate with an existing analog system, we strongly recommend prioritizing a digital mixer that excels in both functionality and cost.
