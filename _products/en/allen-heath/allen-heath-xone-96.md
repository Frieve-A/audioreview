## Overview

The Allen & Heath Xone 96 is a 6+2 channel professional DJ mixer, developed as the successor to the company's legendary Xone:92. This product represents a fusion of the analog circuit design technology cultivated by UK-based Allen & Heath since its 1969 founding, combined with modern digital connectivity. It features a built-in dual 32-bit/96kHz USB audio interface, the traditional 4-band EQ, and VCF filters. The robust design is intended for use in clubs and live venues. The mixer continues the sound characteristics that have been appreciated in the pro DJ industry for many years while adopting a design philosophy adapted to modern digital DJ environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measured performance is excellent, achieving values close to transparency levels. Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is 0.03%, which is well below the audible threshold and approaches the transparency level (0.01% or below). The frequency response measures within Â±0.5dB from 20Hz-30kHz, which achieves the transparency level. The dynamic range is recorded at 104dB, falling just short of the transparency level (105dB or above) but significantly exceeding the problematic level (90dB or below). Channel-to-channel crosstalk is -85dB, sufficiently clearing the transparency level (-70dB or below). The EIN is also an excellent -120dB. The 96kHz/32-bit processing minimizes sound quality degradation in the digital domain.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design leverages Allen & Heath's technical expertise through custom-designed 60mm VCA linear faders and proprietary VCF filter circuits. The dual 96kHz/32-bit USB audio interface provides modern digital connectivity with good integration with DJ software like Traktor and Serato. The 4-band EQ inherits the company's traditional design while incorporating improvements. The CRUNCH harmonic distortion function is a proprietary technology that achieves controlled distortion effects upstream of the filter. The adoption of an InnoFader Mini crossfader ensures operability for scratching applications. However, the technical innovation remains at the industry average level and does not show outstanding advantages compared to the latest digital technologies from other manufacturers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The current market price is approximately 330,000 JPY. Cost-performance is evaluated by the price ratio against the world's cheapest product with equivalent or superior "functions" and "measured performance." The main specifications of the Xone:96 are its features, such as 6-channel input, a dual USB audio interface, and a 4-band EQ, combined with high measured performance, typified by a 104dB dynamic range. While cheaper 6-channel mixers exist on the market, they are significantly inferior in measured performance (especially S/N ratio and distortion) or lack advanced features like a dual USB interface. Consequently, no cheaper alternative exists in the current market that combines equivalent or superior functions and measured performance. Therefore, the cost-performance is rated as 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As a veteran professional audio manufacturer founded in 1969, Allen & Heath has established reliability in the industry. The Xone series has a track record of long-term use in clubs worldwide and has a reputation for durability. In Japan, a 3-year warranty is provided by authorized dealers, and repair systems are well-established. Firmware updates are provided as needed, and long-term support can be expected. However, Allen & Heath's market share in Japan is not as large as Pioneer DJ's, which could potentially lead to some concerns regarding parts procurement and service response speed in emergencies. The product's failure rate remains at a good level, below the industry average, ensuring sufficient reliability for professional use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy of integrating digital interfaces while being based on analog circuits is rational for DJ applications. The circuit design, aimed at improving measured performance and achieving sound quality close to transparency levels, is commendable. The VCF filters and CRUNCH distortion function are not merely decorative features but are designed to actually affect acoustic characteristics, contributing to enhanced DJ expressive capabilities. The adoption of a dual USB interface significantly improves convenience for back-to-back (B2B) performances. On the other hand, the absence of built-in digital effects may limit its adaptability to diverse modern DJ styles and constrain its functional versatility and future expandability.

## Advice

The Allen & Heath Xone 96 is an excellent choice for professional DJs who prioritize sound quality. It is particularly suitable for those seeking to balance the warmth of an analog mixer with the accurate sound reproduction required by modern audio interfaces. DJs who value the distinctive sound of the Xone series' VCF filter and its musical 4-band EQ are strongly recommended to consider this mixer. As the cost-performance rating indicates, the price is justified for a 6-channel professional mixer, and it offers substantial value. However, you should carefully consider whether you truly need 6 channels and can work without built-in effects. If 4 channels are sufficient, other more affordable options from competitors may be worth considering.
