## Overview

The Wharfedale Diamond 220 is a 2-way bookshelf speaker from Wharfedale, a historic British audio manufacturer established in 1932. It features a 5-inch Kevlar woofer and a 1-inch dome tweeter, with a bottom-ported design that enhances placement flexibility. The Diamond series is positioned as the company's entry-level model, marketed as an affordable audio introduction for budget-conscious consumers. With the brand's heritage and tradition as a foundation, it's known as a product that aims for the calm sound signature characteristic of British audio design.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

According to measurements by Sound & Vision magazine, the frequency response is within ±2.5 dB from 200Hz to 10kHz. While this is within the problematic level (±3.0 dB) by policy standards, it does not reach the ideal transparent level (±0.5 dB). Particularly, response irregularities off-axis have been noted in other reviews, suggesting a relatively narrow sweet spot. The nominal minimum frequency response is 56Hz, which is somewhat modest in bass extension compared to competing products in the same price range. Sensitivity is average at 86dB/W/m, but with limited data on THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and S/N ratio, it cannot be concluded that its overall sonic transparency is at the highest level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 2-way configuration with a 5-inch Kevlar woofer and a 1-inch dome tweeter is a standard design for speakers in this class. The slot-loaded port at the bottom is a commendable feature that reduces port noise when placed near a wall, increasing placement flexibility. However, this technology does not dramatically improve fundamental acoustic performance, especially in terms of frequency response flatness or low-frequency extension. The overall technical approach is conservative, without adopting more advanced acoustic designs like coaxial drivers or specialized waveguides. It remains at an industry-average technical level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At the time of this review, its market price is 41,100 yen. A competing product with equivalent or superior performance, the ELAC Debut B5.2, is available for about 39,800 yen. The ELAC Debut B5.2 boasts a nominal frequency response of 46Hz-35kHz, offering a wider playback range. Comparing the performance and price of both, the cost-performance of the Diamond 220 is at a very high level. The calculation is: 39,800 yen ÷ 41,100 yen = 0.97, which results in a score of 1.0. It is one of the most affordable options among products with comparable acoustic performance in this price range, possessing a competitive edge that justifies its purchase. It excels in the pure function-and-performance-to-price ratio.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While Wharfedale, founded in 1932, has a certain reliability as a long-standing manufacturer, it is now manufactured under the umbrella of the large Chinese audio conglomerate IAG. Therefore, the quality control may differ from its past British production era. The warranty period and repair system are at an industry-average level, with no notable advantages. Long-term durability is commensurate with its price, and the robustness of higher-end models should not be expected. As a passive speaker, it requires no firmware updates, so this does not affect the evaluation in this category.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The basic design as a traditional 2-way bookshelf speaker is rational. There is a practical design philosophy, such as considering the user's placement environment by adopting a bottom port while keeping the price down. However, an aggressive stance on scientifically pursuing measured performance, such as flattening the frequency response and reducing distortion to aim for transparent sound quality, is limited. Considering that competitors are achieving wider playback capabilities and superior measurement values at equivalent or lower prices, the design approach must be described as somewhat conservative. While there are no unscientific claims, it does not go as far as to achieve both groundbreaking performance and affordability through an advanced, rational approach.

## Advice

The Wharfedale Diamond 220 is a bookshelf speaker with excellent cost-performance. For around 40,000 yen, it offers stable performance and a touch of the traditional sound character of a British brand, making it a strong contender as an entry-level choice in this price range. However, if you seek deeper bass and a wider frequency response, it is advisable to compare it with products like the ELAC Debut B5.2 (46Hz-35kHz), which is available at almost the same price. It is wise to make a choice based on an objective judgment of sound quality performance through specifications and considering your personal preferences.
