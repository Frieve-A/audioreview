## Overview

The Grado SR-325x is an open-back headphone from Grado Labs, an American company founded in 1953 and based in Brooklyn. Positioned as an upper model in the company's Prestige series, it features aluminum housing and 4th generation X-series drivers. The headphones are characterized by traditional hand assembly and have received recognition including the What Hi-Fi? Awards 2024, earning appreciation from music enthusiasts. With specifications of 18-24,000Hz frequency response, 38-ohm impedance, and 99.8dB@1mW sensitivity, it offers a relatively easy-to-drive design.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The SR-325x has limited measurement data available, with important performance indicators such as THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) not publicly disclosed. While the 18-24,000Hz frequency response covers a standard range, third-party measurements show non-flat characteristics with high-frequency boost and low-frequency roll-off, and detailed results for flatness are insufficient. The driver matching precision of 0.05dB is an excellent figure, but objective data demonstrating overall acoustic performance transparency is lacking. From a scientific perspective, measurement-based validation is crucial. Compared to competitors like the Sennheiser HD560S, it falls short in the degree of objective performance data disclosure, but considering data limitations, it is evaluated at average level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 4th generation X-series driver incorporates a redesigned diaphragm and powerful magnetic circuit, with technical improvements aimed at achieving low distortion. The aluminum housing for resonance control is also a technically rational approach. Hand assembly and quality control also represent technical value. However, it fundamentally remains within the scope of conventional dynamic driver design, with no industry-leading innovative technologies evident. Compared to competing products in the same price range, clear elements demonstrating technical superiority are limited. From current technical standards, it appears to remain at the level of solid improvements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Against the SR-325x's price of 295 USD, the Sennheiser HD560S with equivalent or superior performance is available for 200 USD. The HD560S achieves 120-ohm impedance, excellent measurement results (THD<0.05%, frequency response within ±1dB), and flat frequency response, making it a product judged to have equivalent or superior objective performance. Cost-performance calculation: 200 USD ÷ 295 USD ≈ 0.678, which rounds to 0.7 when rounded to the nearest 0.1 unit. With equivalent function and measurement performance products available at lower prices, cost-performance is evaluated to be at an above-average level.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Grado Labs has established credentials as a veteran manufacturer founded in 1953, with a quality control system in place through hand assembly in Brooklyn. Product durability generally receives good evaluations, and after-service systems meet standard levels. Warranty period is 1 year, and repair support is at industry average levels. Some emerging manufacturers provide more comprehensive support. Overall, it can be evaluated as having reliability above industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The SR-325x's design philosophy emphasizes traditional analog approaches, showing a tendency to prioritize subjective "musicality" over objective sound quality improvement based on measurement results. This policy diverges somewhat from scientific sound quality improvement approaches and does not actively incorporate modern measurement technology or digital processing-based sound quality optimization methods. While competing manufacturers focus on publishing measurement data and objective performance improvement, Grado continues to depend on conventional methods. It cannot be said to fully adopt rational approaches for achieving high-transparency sound reproduction, and the rationality of design from a scientific perspective is at average level.

## Advice

The SR-325x is an attractive choice for music enthusiasts who prefer traditional Grado sound, but cannot be recommended for buyers who prioritize objective performance and price. Many alternatives exist in the same price range with superior measurement performance like the Sennheiser HD560S, or options achieving higher cost-performance. Particularly for those purchasing open-back headphones for the first time or seeking objective sound quality improvement, we recommend selecting products with comprehensive measurement data and scientifically-based design. When prioritizing transparent and accurate sound reproduction over brand history or subjective sound characteristics, it is rational to consider other alternatives.
