## Overview

The Grado GW100x continues the GW100 line that introduced the first open-back Bluetooth headphones, combining Grado Labs’ 70+ years of audiophile expertise with modern wireless technology. Featuring newly developed 4th-generation 44mm drivers tuned for wireless use, the GW100x delivers the Grado sound via Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC support. With a claimed 46-hour battery life and a Grado claim of up to 60% reduction in sound leakage versus their wired models, these headphones target audiophiles seeking untethered listening in quiet environments while maintaining the open-back soundstage and natural presentation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent third-party measurements for the GW100x remain limited, constraining objective evaluation. Manufacturer specifications list Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX Adaptive, nominal impedance of 38 Ω, and drivers matched to 0.1 dB, but there are no published tolerances for frequency response or verified third-party THD/linearity data. Given the absence of comprehensive measurements, the score is set at a neutral baseline.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The GW100x shows solid implementation through Grado’s 4th-generation “X” drivers (redesigned magnetic circuit, lower effective voice-coil mass, optimized diaphragm) and modern wireless integration (Bluetooth 5.2, aptX Adaptive). Achieving a quoted 46-hour battery life is notable for an open-back wireless design. Innovation is meaningful within Grado’s acoustic philosophy, even if not a category-wide technological leap.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

At 275 USD, the GW100x faces competition from HIFIMAN’s DEVA Pro (with the Bluemini R2R wireless module) at 199 USD official pricing. Both deliver open-back wireless listening, microphone support, and wired/wireless flexibility. The GW100x offers far longer battery life (46 h vs 6–7 h on Bluemini R2R) and Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX Adaptive, while the DEVA Pro’s Bluemini supports LDAC/aptX-HD. Cost-performance ratio: **0.72**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Grado offers a **1-year** U.S. manufacturer warranty (coverage outside the U.S. is via local distributors). This is serviceable but not generous. No widespread, verifiable defect patterns have been established from primary sources. The score reflects the short warranty length and otherwise standard support posture.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Grado’s engineering-first iteration from GW100 to GW100x—driver updates, Bluetooth 5.2, and long battery life—fits the intended niche: stationary, private listening that values an open-back soundstage over isolation. The concept executes well within that use case.

## Advice

For listeners who want open-back spaciousness without a cable in quiet home settings, the GW100x is compelling. Alternatives are few, but options like the HIFIMAN DEVA Pro exist if you prefer LDAC and can live with much shorter wireless battery life. If you often listen near others, remember that even with Grado’s leakage-reduction claim, open-back designs still leak sound and are best used privately.
