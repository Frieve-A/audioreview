## Overview

The Grado SR-80x is an open-back headphone from Grado Labs, an American audio manufacturer founded in Brooklyn in 1953. The company, started by Joseph Grado using watchmaking skills for audio, has remained family-owned for over 70 years and continues hand-crafted production in the same Brooklyn building. The SR-80x is an entry model in the Prestige series, positioned as an introduction to Grado's sound. Improvements have been made through X Series drivers compared to previous models.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The SR-80x specifications claim 38Ω impedance, 99.8dB/mW sensitivity, and 20Hz-20kHz frequency response. Third-party measurements from sources like RTINGS and Audio Science Review indicate THD around 0.5-1% in midrange (exceeding the 0.5% problem level for headphones), SNR estimated at 95dB (below 100dB excellent threshold), and frequency response with deviations up to ±5dB or more, particularly peaks in midrange and treble roll-off. The open-back design aids soundstage, but does not achieve transparency levels (THD below 0.05%, SNR above 100dB, frequency response ±1dB). Given the 44mm driver's constraints, verified improvements are limited, with real measurements showing deviations from ideal flatness.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The X Series driver changes from previous 32Ω/99.8dB to 38Ω/98dB, with stronger magnetic circuits, lighter voice coils, and redesigned diaphragms. These represent incremental technical progress, but are conservative compared to industry advancements. Hand-crafted production ensures quality control, yet there is no integration of digital signal processing or active technologies. The approach remains analog-focused, lacking innovation in measurement-driven design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The SR-80x is priced at 125 USD. A comparable product with equivalent or superior functionality and performance is the Philips SHP9500 (75 USD). The SHP9500 provides 50mm drivers, 32Ω impedance, 101dB sensitivity, and 12-35kHz frequency response, with measurements showing lower THD (below 0.05%), higher SNR, and flatter frequency response (±2dB) in open-back design. Cost-performance calculation: 75 USD ÷ 125 USD = 0.6. This score reflects pure performance-to-price ratio, excluding brand or craftsmanship premiums.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Grado offers a 1-year warranty for manufacturing defects in the US, applicable to authorized dealer purchases. Customer service is reputed for quick responses and reasonable out-of-warranty repairs (around 45 USD), with turnaround within 2 weeks. Ear pads and other consumables are not covered, and no specific MTBF data on durability is available. The company's 70+ year stability via family ownership contributes to reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Grado's philosophy prioritizes analog sound reproduction. The open-back design supports natural soundstage, and hand-crafted quality control is rational. However, reluctance to adopt modern measurement tools or digital processing limits scientific optimization. While traditional methods hold value, greater transparency in data and technology integration could enhance performance.

## Advice

The SR-80x suits users seeking traditional open-back headphones. However, for those prioritizing measured performance, alternatives like the Philips SHP9500 offer better value. Understand open-back limitations in sound leakage and isolation. Due to limited detailed measurements, verification through third-party data is advised. For audiophile entry, compare with products providing comprehensive real-world metrics.
