## Overview

The Grado RS2x represents the latest iteration in Grado's Reference Series, featuring a distinctive dual-wood construction that marries maple sleeve rings with hemp wood cores. Built around Grado's 4th-generation X Driver technology with 44mm custom drivers, the RS2x maintains the company's traditional hand-assembly approach in their Brooklyn facility. The headphones feature an open-back dynamic design with 38-ohm impedance, 99.8 dB sensitivity, and frequency response spanning 14-28,000 Hz according to manufacturer specifications. This model incorporates design improvements including increased magnetic circuit power, decreased voice coil effective mass, and a reconfigured diaphragm compared to its predecessor.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Multiple measurement sources reveal significant performance issues that place the RS2x below acceptable standards for transparent audio reproduction. SoundStage Network measurements using GRAS Model 43AG ear/cheek simulator show unusual frequency response peaks at 2.2 kHz and 4 kHz, with a broad lift between 7-10 kHz that deviates substantially from ideal response [1]. Most concerning is the "very high distortion in the bass" measured at 90-100 dBA listening levels, placing harmonic distortion performance at problematic levels that compromise transparent audio reproduction [1]. While measured sensitivity of 107.1 dB (300Hz-3kHz average) exceeds specifications, and driver matching within 0.5 dB meets excellent standards, these positive aspects are overshadowed by fundamental frequency response and distortion issues. Super Best Audio Friends measurements confirm improvement in second harmonic distortion over the previous RS2e model, but performance remains insufficient for transparent reproduction [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Grado demonstrates substantial technical achievement through their extensive patent portfolio of 48+ patents and proprietary 4th-generation X Driver technology featuring increased magnetic speaker power and decreased voice coil effective mass [3]. The company maintains complete design ownership with in-house development and hand assembly in their Brooklyn facility, representing high technical expertise accumulated over 70+ years of audio manufacturing [4]. The dual-wood construction approach using maple and hemp materials shows sophisticated material engineering, while the super annealed copper 8-conductor cable design reflects advanced cable technology compared to entry-level 4-conductor designs [5]. However, the purely analog/mechanical approach without digital integration or cutting-edge technologies limits advancement potential. The traditional dynamic driver technology, while refined, represents contemporary rather than leading-edge implementation that other manufacturers would seek to adopt.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. At 550 USD, the RS2x provides basic open-back stereo headphone functionality with problematic frequency response characteristics and high bass distortion [6]. The HiFiMan Sundara at 279 USD offers equivalent stereo functionality with superior measured performance, including flat response from 20Hz-600Hz, controlled 10-13dB peak at 3.3kHz, and excellent THD performance below problematic levels in low frequencies [7][8]. Equipped with equivalent open-back design, similar impedance characteristics (32-37 ohm vs 38 ohm), and comparable sensitivity ratings, the Sundara's frequency response linearity and distortion performance are demonstrably superior to the RS2x's irregular peaks and "very high" bass distortion. CP = 279 USD ÷ 550 USD = 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Grado provides a 1-year US manufacturer warranty covering factory defects, which falls below the industry average of 2 years [9]. The warranty requires purchase from authorized dealers and excludes consumable items like eartips and cushions. Support infrastructure includes direct manufacturer service with repair costs ranging from 45-75 USD and turnaround times of 1-2 weeks based on user reports [10]. The company maintains its original Brooklyn manufacturing facility with established repair capabilities, and products must be serviced in the country of original purchase. While Grado has a strong reliability track record as an established manufacturer since 1953, the shorter warranty period and traditional construction without modern reliability enhancements limit the overall reliability proposition. No specific failure rate data is publicly available for assessment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Grado's design philosophy emphasizes "analog reproduction" and "trial and error" approaches that prioritize subjective listening over measurement-focused optimization [11]. The company explicitly states they are "trial and error types of designers" who focus on recreating "the sound of live music" rather than achieving transparent reproduction [11]. This subjective approach results in measurably problematic frequency response and distortion performance that contradicts scientific audio reproduction principles. The high manufacturing costs associated with hand assembly and premium material choices are not justified by corresponding improvements in measured performance. While the company shows some performance progression with noted improvements over the RS2e model, the conservative evolutionary approach explicitly "refuses to chase flashy revolutions" in favor of traditional methods [12]. The emphasis on craftsmanship and heritage over objective performance optimization represents an irrational approach to audio equipment design that prioritizes subjective preferences over scientifically meaningful improvements.

## Advice

The RS2x is suitable for users who prioritize Grado's distinctive aesthetic and traditional craftsmanship over measured audio performance. The handmade Brooklyn construction and dual-wood materials appeal to those valuing artisanal manufacturing approaches. However, prospective buyers should be aware that multiple measurement sources document significant frequency response irregularities and high bass distortion that compromise transparent audio reproduction. For users seeking optimal measured performance at this price point, alternatives like the HiFiMan Sundara provide superior frequency response linearity and lower distortion at approximately half the cost. The short 1-year warranty and comfort limitations reported by users should also factor into purchasing decisions. The RS2x represents a lifestyle choice for Grado enthusiasts rather than an optimal technical solution for transparent audio reproduction.
