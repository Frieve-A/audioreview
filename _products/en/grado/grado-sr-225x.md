## Overview

The Grado SR-225x is a mid-range model in the Prestige X series, handcrafted in Brooklyn, New York. It features 44mm fourth-generation X Drivers and is priced at 225 USD. Founded in 1953, the company is known for its unique acoustic traits and artisanal production. The open-back design provides a spacious soundstage, and its 38-ohm impedance allows driving by portable devices.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Official specs list frequency response as 20-22kHz, SPL 99.8dB@1mW, and driver matching 0.05dB. However, third-party measurements show FR deviations exceeding ±3dB in midrange, THD around 0.1-0.5% in bass, and SNR below 100dB. Crosstalk is -50dB, below transparent levels. IMD and dynamic range data are limited. Open-back isolation is under 10dB, at problem level. Overall, it fails to meet headphone criteria for transparency, with verifiable data indicating subpar performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The fourth-generation drivers aim for better efficiency and lower distortion, but details on innovations like magnetic circuits or coil reductions are vague and standard industry-wise. Handcrafted methods question consistency versus modern precision manufacturing. No advanced materials or driver tech seen in competitors. It represents average technical progress, lacking standout advancements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At 225 USD, competitors like Philips SHP9500 (79 USD) offer equivalent or better FR flatness and lower THD via dynamic drivers. 79 USD ÷ 225 USD = 0.35, rounded to 0.4. Other options: HiFiMan HE400se (129 USD, planar for lower distortion), Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X (199 USD, studio-grade crosstalk), Audio-Technica ATH-AD700X (129 USD, wide soundstage). Single lowest equivalent used for CP; multiples confirm similar ratio without averaging due to SHP9500 as clear baseline.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a 70+ year manufacturer, Grado has established reliability, but specific failure rates or MTBF are undisclosed. Warranty is 1 year, with Brooklyn-based repairs available, but support details are limited. It meets industry averages but lacks modern enhancements like extended warranties seen in competitors.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Open-back for soundstage is rational, but limited data disclosure hinders verification of transparent performance. Handcrafting may compromise consistency versus precision methods. No scientific evidence for superiority over competitors' planar or high-precision approaches. Needs better data transparency and evidence-based improvements.

## Advice

For those prioritizing scientific metrics and value, consider alternatives. Philips SHP9500 (79 USD) is 146 USD cheaper with comparable open-back performance and better FR consistency. HiFiMan HE400se (129 USD) offers superior low-distortion via planar tech, 96 USD less. Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X (199 USD) provides better measurements for 26 USD less. Audio-Technica ATH-AD700X (129 USD) matches functionality at lower cost. These options excel in data transparency and efficiency.
