## Overview

The Apogee Symphony Desktop is a professional 10×14 USB-C audio interface featuring 24-bit/192kHz conversion, two Advanced Stepped Gain mic preamps (up to 75dB gain), built-in DSP with preamp emulations, touchscreen control, and DualPath monitoring. Manufacturer specifications cite A/D dynamic range of **123dB(A)**, D/A dynamic range of **129dB(A)**, and **-114dB THD+N**; headphones are specified at **128dB(A)** dynamic range and **-111dB THD+N at 600Ω** [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

From audibility-relevant metrics, the published figures (A/D 123dB(A), D/A 129dB(A), THD+N -114dB, frequency response ±0.05dB 10Hz–20kHz, headphones 128dB(A) / -111dB at 600Ω) meet transparent-class targets for interfaces. At the time of writing we did **not** find credible third-party lab measurements specific to Symphony Desktop; therefore, this section relies on **manufacturer specifications**, clearly labeled as such, with conditions noted where provided. We will incorporate independent lab results when available [1][4].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Advanced Stepped Gain preamps (75dB), integrated DSP for low-latency monitoring/processing, class-compliant USB-C operation, and an onboard touchscreen indicate a modern, well-integrated design. The conversion performance targets are high but represent established state-of-the-art rather than a new architectural leap. Competing vendors offer similar ESS-based implementations and DSP mixers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better):** **MOTU UltraLite-mk5** — 18×22 I/O, two mic pres, ADAT/TOSLINK (optical S/PDIF), DSP mixer. Key specs (manufacturer): **line-out 125dB(A) DR**, **line-in 120dB(A) DR**, **THD+N -114dB** — within a ±5% window vs Symphony Desktop’s headline A/D/D/A/THD+N, so judged *equivalent* on core measured axes; user-facing functions are also comparable or greater (more I/O) [2][3][5].  
**Prices (current market):** Symphony Desktop **1,599 USD** [5]; UltraLite-mk5 **699.95 USD** [2][6].  
**CP calculation:** (699.95 ÷ 1,599 = 0.438 → **0.4**).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Apogee provides current documentation and an active knowledge base for Symphony Desktop (user guide, setup, and troubleshooting). The product family has ongoing software/support infrastructure consistent with pro-audio norms; no elevated failure patterns are indicated in credible sources we checked [4][7].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Design choices focus on measurable transparency (noise, distortion, dynamic range) and workflow efficiency (low-latency DSP, touchscreen). No reliance on non-scientific claims is observed; spend is directed toward audibly meaningful metrics and usability.

## Advice

If you specifically need Apogee’s ecosystem (plugins/DualPath workflow/touch UI) and are comfortable with the price premium, Symphony Desktop is a strong, transparent interface. If your priority is **transparent conversion and core I/O** at the lowest price, the **MOTU UltraLite-mk5** delivers equivalent headline performance metrics and broader I/O at ~44% of the cost, making it the rational default for most buyers [2][3][6].
