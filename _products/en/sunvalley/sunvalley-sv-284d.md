summary: "A 211/845 tube booster/power amplifier with switchable single-stereo (one chassis) or balanced-single mono (two chassis). Manufacturer test sheet shows up to 36W/ch (with SV-300LB direct XLR drive), frequency response −3dB: 10Hz–40kHz at 1W/8Ω, and 0.5mV residual noise (input short)[2]. Comprehensive third-party measurements are scarce; Sunvalley announced sales end by March 2027 with support continuing thereafter[3]."

## Overview

SV-284D adds a high-voltage transmitting-tube stage after your existing amplifier (“booster mode”) and can also run as a stand-alone power amp. Two units enable **balanced-single mono** operation[1][4]. Manufacturer test sheet lists: max output 36W/ch (with SV-300LB direct XLR drive), frequency response −3dB: 10Hz–40kHz at 1W/8Ω, residual noise 0.5mV (input short), AC100V/3.9A during tests[2]. Typical market pricing in Japan ranges 416,900–757,900円 depending on tube sets[1] (used here only as context; this English article evaluates CP in USD). Sunvalley has officially stated product sales will cease by March 2027, with support specialization afterwards[3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

With few independent lab measurements available, we provisionally cite the manufacturer test sheet: FR −3dB at 10Hz–40kHz (1W/8Ω), residual noise 0.5mV (input short), and up to 36W/ch when driven directly by SV-300LB (Gain: NORMAL, no NFB)[2]. Because a booster inherits upstream distortion/noise, audible transparency gains for the total system remain unproven without third-party THD+N/IMD/SNR data under controlled conditions. We anchor at 0.5 when unknown and adjust downward to **0.3**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Notable ingredients include transformer-drive aimed at A2 operation and a flexible topology (single-stereo vs balanced-single mono)[4][5]. However, compared with modern measurement-driven designs, there’s limited emphasis on active linearization or feedback optimization. We rate it slightly above average at **0.4**.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

**Comparator (equal-or-better)**: **Fosi Audio V3 (stereo)** — same user-facing function (driving passive speakers) with manufacturer specs **THD ≤0.003%**, **SNR ≥110 dB**, **20Hz–20kHz (±0.1 dB)**, and third-party **SINAD ≈88 dB**[10][11].  
**Market price (numerator)**: **69.99 USD and up** (official store; product page lists “From 69.99 USD,” power adapter included in package)[10].  
**SV-284D price used (denominator)**: **4,000 USD**.  
**Calculation**: **69.99 USD ÷ 4,000 USD = 0.0175… → 0.0**.  
Given the existence of a far cheaper path to transparent amplification, CP bottoms out at **0.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Official notice: all product sales end by **March 2027**; the company transitions to support-focused operations[3]. Continued manufacturer support is positive, but long-term availability of large tubes (211/845), heat, and high-voltage serviceability are inherent risks. Overall slightly above average at **0.6**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Company communications emphasize tube character and “rich overtones”[5]. Without external evidence of audibly superior distortion/noise performance versus modern transparent amplifiers, a booster topology is hard to justify on scientific grounds. Hence **0.3**.

## Advice

Choose SV-284D if you specifically want the transmitting-tube experience and flexible modes (booster/stand-alone/balanced-mono). If your goal is maximum transparency per dollar, a **Fosi Audio V3 (from 69.99 USD)**[10] is the rational baseline. Need balanced inputs/higher headroom? Consider **V3 Mono (pair)** as an alternative path[6][7]. Prefer an integrated with plentiful I/O and published measurements? **Cambridge Audio CXA81 Mk II (1,199 USD)** remains a solid option[8][9]. If you proceed with SV-284D, plan for heat, space, tube sourcing, and system-level noise management.
