## Overview

The Sunvalley SV-91B is a premium 300B single-ended tube amplifier that has served as the company's flagship reference amplifier since 2003. Manufactured by Sunvalley Audio (Japan), this hand-wired amplifier features high-quality Hashimoto transformers and a tube complement including WE310A driver tubes, 300B power tubes, and 274B rectifier tubes. The amplifier is notable for its control and clarity characteristics; the company cites magazine listening reports that it drove B&W 800 series despite being a single-ended design [1]. Official pricing on the manufacturer site is listed as ¥366,300–¥779,240 (tax-in), depending on kit/assembled and tube options [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The SV-91B delivers 10W+10W into 8Ω at 10% THD, with frequency response spanning 12Hz-60kHz (-3dB at 1W into 8Ω) and 27dB gain [1]. The 10% THD at rated output is 100× higher than the 0.1% problematic threshold for amplifiers, firmly placing it in problematic distortion territory. Frequency response shows reasonable bandwidth but lacks deviation limits. Single-ended tube designs inherently produce higher even-order harmonics compared to modern solid-state alternatives achieving <0.01% THD. While the amplifier may exhibit the characteristic "warm" tube sound appreciated by some listeners, these measurable deviations from transparency are not scientifically optimal for high-fidelity reproduction.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The SV-91B demonstrates careful craftsmanship with premium Hashimoto transformers, point-to-point wiring, and quality tube selection. However, the fundamental single-ended Class A approach is legacy technology with inherent limitations, and there is no novel topology or measurable advance versus contemporary best practices. Modern Class D and solid-state designs achieve far superior measured performance with higher efficiency and lower distortion. Within this context, the SV-91B reflects refined execution of historical methods rather than technological advancement, warranting a lower technology score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Using the policy’s requirement to compare across classes by function and measured performance: Fosi Audio V3 (stereo Class D) delivers objectively superior transparency (ASR lab tests; THD+N/SINAD far better than tube SE designs) at an everyday price of ¥12,599 on Amazon.co.jp [2][3]. Comparing the least expensive official SV-91B configuration (¥366,300 tax-in) to V3:

¥12,599 ÷ ¥366,300 = 0.034 → 0.0 (rounded to one decimal).

Functionally, both are 2-channel power amplifiers for passive speakers; V3’s measured distortion/noise is markedly lower per [2], so it qualifies as “equal or better measured performance.” While SV-91B offers premium build and traditional tube appeal, its cost-performance is very poor versus the cheapest scientifically superior alternative.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Sunvalley Audio has maintained the SV-91B design for over 20 years since 2003, indicating design maturity and component stability. The company offers both kit and assembled versions, suggesting adequate manufacturing support infrastructure. However, as a Japanese boutique manufacturer with limited global presence, service and parts availability outside Japan may be constrained. Vacuum tube amplifiers inherently require periodic tube replacement and maintenance compared to solid-state alternatives. The hand-wired construction, while premium, may complicate service compared to PCB-based designs. Limited information exists regarding failure rates, warranty coverage, or international service networks for this specific model.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The SV-91B represents pursuit of vintage tube amplifier aesthetics and subjective "musicality" over measurable fidelity improvements. Single-ended 300B designs inherently produce higher distortion, lower efficiency, and greater maintenance requirements compared to modern alternatives achieving superior measured performance. The 10% THD specification demonstrates acceptance of significant distortion that modern Class D amplifiers avoid entirely while delivering greater power efficiency. The premium pricing for subjectively-oriented design choices without corresponding improvements in transparency, dynamic range, or signal-to-noise ratio reflects prioritization of brand prestige and vintage appeal over rational progress toward high-fidelity reproduction. The approach serves traditional tube enthusiast preferences rather than advancing scientific audio reproduction.

## Advice

The SV-91B appeals primarily to traditional tube amplifier enthusiasts seeking premium build quality and heritage rather than optimal measured transparency. Prospective buyers should consider whether 10% THD and the official pricing (¥366,300–¥779,240, tax-in) align with their fidelity priorities when objectively superior options exist at far lower cost. For maximum fidelity per yen, modern Class D amplifiers such as Fosi Audio V3 achieve around 88 dB SINAD in independent lab tests at ¥12,599 [2][3]. The SV-91B best serves collectors and enthusiasts who value traditional tube construction and brand heritage over measurable audio accuracy and efficiency.
