## Overview

The Sunvalley SV-275 is a KT88 push-pull tube power amplifier from Sunvalley, a brand known for its audio kits. It delivers a 38W+38W (8Ω, THD 10%) output and employs a tube configuration of 12AX7×2, 6BQ5×4, and KT88×4. The frequency response spans 5Hz-125kHz (1W/8Ω/-3dB) with 4/8/16Ω speaker compatibility, measuring W430×H195×D270mm and weighing 18kg. Available as a used unit for 660 USD, representing the market price for this kit-built product. The company ceased all product sales operations in May 2023, now focusing exclusively on product support.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The measurement performance falls significantly below modern acoustic technology standards. The specified THD of 10% represents a distortion rate 1000 times higher than transparency levels of 0.01%, and 100 times worse than problematic levels of 0.1%. While the 38W+38W output falls within appropriate ranges, 10% THD introduces 10% distortion to the signal, resulting in audibly degraded acoustic reproduction. The frequency response of 5Hz-125kHz covers the standard range, but high distortion severely limits practical utility. Compared to modern digital amplifiers achieving 0.003% THD and 110dB SNR, this represents a more than 3300-fold inferior distortion characteristic by scientific audio quality standards, making it unrecommendable from a master source fidelity perspective.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The design employs classic tube architecture with KT88 push-pull circuitry, featuring artisanal point-to-point wiring construction typical of kit-based products. The configuration of 12AX7 input tubes, 6BQ5 driver tubes, and KT88 output tubes represents circuit topology established since the 1950s, with proven basic amplification principles. While the assembly precision depends on the builder's skill, the fundamental design lacks technological innovation. Partial improvements including 4/8/16Ω speaker compatibility and temperature compensation circuits exist, but technical originality remains limited compared to modern semiconductor technology, digital signal processing, and Class D amplifier technology. The technical level significantly lags behind industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The cost-performance ratio is extremely poor. Against the used price of 660 USD, the equivalent-output Fosi Audio V3 is available for 90 USD. The V3 delivers 38W×2 output (8Ω) at 32V power supply with superior performance of 0.003% THD and 110dB SNR, vastly exceeding the SV-275's 10% THD. Cost-performance calculation: 90 USD ÷ 660 USD = 0.136, rounded to 0.1. This result indicates that equivalent function and measurement performance can be obtained at approximately one-seventh the price, with no objective advantages justifying the price differential.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a kit-built amplifier, reliability heavily depends on the quality of the initial assembly. The KT88, 12AX7, and 6BQ5 are relatively accessible general-purpose tubes, enabling regular replacement maintenance. The 18kg weight and large chassis heat dissipation design contribute to long-term operational stability. However, purchase opportunities are limited as the company ceased all product sales operations in May 2023, now focusing solely on product support. Tube amplifier-specific requirements including temperature management, bias adjustment, and tube replacement demand high maintenance compared to semiconductor amplifiers, increasing maintenance costs.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy is extremely irrational from a scientific audio quality improvement perspective. The 10% THD measurement result represents more than 3300 times the distortion rate of modern digital technology's 0.003% THD, constituting a design that intentionally introduces objective audio quality degradation. Prioritizing immeasurable subjective effects like "tube-like sound" or "musicality" does not contribute to master source fidelity improvement. The 38W output lacks technical necessity when the 89.99 USD Fosi Audio V3 achieves equivalent output at 0.003% THD with a 32V power supply. The wide-band 5Hz-125kHz characteristic loses practical utility due to high distortion, representing an irrational approach contrary to achieving modern transparency-level audio quality.

## Advice

The Sunvalley SV-275 cannot be recommended by scientific audio quality standards. Against the used price of 660 USD, the 90 USD Fosi Audio V3 achieves superior performance with 38W×2 output at 32V power supply and 0.003% THD, making the approximately 7-fold price difference irrational. The V3 demonstrates objective superiority with 110dB SNR, 20Hz-20kHz frequency response, and over 95% Class D efficiency, vastly exceeding the SV-275's 10% THD, 18kg weight, and high power consumption. KT88 tube "warmth" or "musicality" represents immeasurable subjective evaluation lacking acoustic engineering foundation. For users seeking maximum audio quality within limited budgets, modern digital technology utilizing Class D amplifiers is strongly recommended. The company's sales cessation also eliminates new purchase opportunities. Prospective buyers should thoroughly compare objective measurement performance and price differentials.
