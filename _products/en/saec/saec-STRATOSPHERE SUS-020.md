## Overview

The SAEC STRATOSPHERE SUS-020 is a flagship USB cable from SAEC Commerce, a venerable Japanese audio cable manufacturer. Founded in 1974, SAEC is known as the inventor of proprietary PC-TripleC conductor technology and began serious audio cable manufacturing in 1983. The SUS-020 represents the pinnacle of the company's STRATOSPHERE series, featuring the PC-TripleC EX conductor that combines copper and silver. Priced at 48,000 JPY (excluding tax, approx. 52,800 JPY including tax), it's available in multiple lengths from 0.7m to 4.5m and various connector configurations including USB A-B, A-micro B, and A-C specifications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The impact of cable quality on audio performance in digital USB transmission is scientifically extremely limited. USB employs packet communication with error correction, making the influence of conductor material and structure on sound quality fall far below audible thresholds. While the PC-TripleC EX conductor boasts a high conductivity of 105% IACS, this offers no audible advantage in digital signal transmission quality. There is insufficient scientific evidence linking measurable improvements in electrical characteristics to actual enhancements in sound quality, making it difficult to distinguish from a placebo effect. Without proof of a significant difference through ABX blind testing, there is no evidence that the technology used contributes to any improvement in auditory transparency.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The PC-TripleC EX conductor is a proprietary technology achieving 105% IACS conductivity through a two-layer structure of copper and 5N silver, demonstrating recognized technical advancement. The three-layer shield structure (aluminum foil x2 + copper braid) for electromagnetic interference countermeasures and fluororesin insulation for a low dielectric constant design represent rational approaches from a cable engineering perspective. SAEC's nearly 50-year track record and proprietary conductor development capabilities are commendable, but these technologies constitute excessive specifications that far exceed the necessary standards for USB digital transmission. While the technical capabilities surpass industry standards, their appropriateness for the intended application is questionable.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

For this product's price of approximately 52,800 JPY (tax included), equivalent transmission performance can be fully achieved with a standard cable like the Amazon Basics USB 2.0 A-B Cable (approx. 600 JPY). The price comparison yields "600 JPY รท 52,800 JPY = approx. 0.011," which rounds to a score of 0.0. Cables meeting the necessary specifications for high-quality digital transmission are available for under 1,000 JPY, with the price difference attributable to added value that does not contribute to sound quality improvement. Even an AudioQuest Carbon class cable (approx. 15,000 JPY) represents an excessive investment for practical purposes. This pricing is extremely irrational within the USB cable category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a manufacturer established in 1974, SAEC maintains a stable corporate foundation with good quality control through handcrafted production in Japan. However, information disclosure regarding warranty periods and specific after-sales service systems is insufficient. The company's products are generally considered highly durable, with a nearly 50-year track record providing confidence in product quality. Nevertheless, the lack of clear warranty information for such a high-priced product is an area for improvement. As a domestic manufacturer, support for failures can be expected, but the international support system is limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The design philosophy of applying knowledge from analog audio transmission to digital USB transmission represents a completely misguided direction that lacks an understanding of the technical background. In digital transmission, minute differences in conductor characteristics do not affect sound quality; rather, proper impedance matching and electromagnetic interference countermeasures are key. PC-TripleC technology may be meaningful for analog cables, but it is entirely an excessive specification for packet-based USB communication. While the goal of achieving transparent sound quality is correct, transparency in the digital domain is already achieved with cables costing a few hundred yen. There is no rationality for a high-priced dedicated cable when equivalent results can be obtained with a generic USB cable; its philosophy is unscientific.

## Advice

When considering cable quality for USB audio applications, it is crucial to understand the mechanism of digital transmission. USB uses packet communication with error correction, meaning no sound quality difference will occur with a properly compliant cable. With a budget of around 50,000 JPY, we strongly recommend investing in equipment that directly impacts sound quality, such as a DAC, amplifier, or speakers. Even if you insist on a premium cable, a standard USB cable available for around 1,000 JPY, such as from Amazon Basics, is perfectly sufficient. The remaining budget should be allocated to more effective equipment upgrades. Identifying rational investment priorities in the audio hobby and making science-based decisions is the shortest path to genuine sound quality improvement.
