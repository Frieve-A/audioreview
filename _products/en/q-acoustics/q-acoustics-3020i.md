## Overview

The Q Acoustics 3020i is a 2-way reflex bookshelf loudspeaker using a 125 mm coated paper woofer and a 22 mm decoupled tweeter. Versus its predecessor, cabinet internal volume increases by about 25% to extend bass and scale. Point-to-Point (P2P) bracing and low-profile terminals target improved rigidity and placement flexibility [1].

## Scientific Validity  
$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Measured performance (key figures)**  
- Flatness (300 Hz–5 kHz, peak-to-peak): 3.0 dB [2]  
- Bass extension: F3 = 82.0 Hz, F6 = 60.1 Hz (Klippel NFS) [2]  
- Preference score (no sub / with ideal sub): 3.91 / 6.43; with EQ: 6.07 / 8.21 [2]  
- Nominal / minimum impedance: 6 Ω / 4 Ω (spec) [1]  
- Sensitivity (spec): 88 dB at 2.83 V/1 m [1]  
- Crossover: ~2.4 kHz (spec) [1]

**Problem level vs thresholds (interpretation)**  
- Linearity: 3.0 dB p-p in the critical 300 Hz–5 kHz band indicates a **moderate** deviation from transparency; tonal dip around 2 kHz shapes a relaxed balance.  
- Extension: F3 at 82 Hz is **typical** for a compact 5″ class bookshelf, not deep.  
- Directivity / reflections set and full CTA-2034 data are available, enabling reliable EQ and placement optimization.

**Transparency level (evidence quality)**  
- **High**: full Klippel NFS dataset with on-axis, listening window, early reflections and PIR is published by a third party [2].  
Overall, competitive measurements for the segment but not reference-grade neutrality; thus 0.7.

## Technology Level  
$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Architecture (2-way reflex), P2P bracing, tweeter decoupling, and ~2.4 kHz crossover are appropriate for the segment. Gelcore constrained-layer tech is reserved for upper lines and not used here [1]. The ~25% cabinet volume increase and terminal redesign are sensible updates for this class.

## Cost-Performance  
$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Current general retail price (US):** 449 USD / pair (Q Acoustics US) [1][6].  
**Benchmark (cheapest equal-or-better objective performance, cross-class allowed):** Emotiva Airmotiv B1+ — 229 USD / pair (official) [3]. Independent NFS data show: F3 ≈ 71.8 Hz, flatness 2.8 dB p-p (300 Hz–5 kHz), preference 4.66 (no sub) [4]. These figures are equal or better than the 3020i on the core metrics listed above.

**Head-to-head metrics**  
- Flatness (p-p): 3020i = 3.0 dB vs B1+ = 2.8 dB → B1+ better [2][4]  
- Bass extension (F3): 3020i = 82.0 Hz vs B1+ = 71.8 Hz → B1+ deeper [2][4]  
- Preference (no sub): 3020i = 3.91 vs B1+ = 4.66 → B1+ higher [2][4]

**CP formula (disclosed):**  
CP score = Benchmark price / Product price = 229 USD / 449 USD = 0.5 (rounded to one decimal).  
Given cheaper equal-or-better alternatives, value is modest at current pricing.

## Reliability & Support  
$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Q Acoustics (est. 2006) maintains worldwide distribution and standard warranty coverage. As a passive loudspeaker, software-related risks are minimal. No pattern of systemic defects was identified in official channels [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy  
$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The cabinet volume increase for bass headroom, P2P bracing for resonance control, and tweeter decoupling to reduce mechanical coupling are acoustically coherent. Driver sizing and crossover choices fit the intended small-room use and price class.

## Advice

The 3020i suits listeners who prefer a smooth, non-fatiguing tonality and broad soundstage in small-to-medium rooms. Adding a subwoofer (80–100 Hz crossover) or applying modest EQ can materially improve objective performance per the spin data. If maximizing objective fidelity per dollar is your top priority, cross-shop the Emotiva B1+.
