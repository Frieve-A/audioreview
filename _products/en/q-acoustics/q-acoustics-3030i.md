## Overview

The Q Acoustics 3030i is a premium bookshelf speaker from the 3000i series by British manufacturer Q Acoustics. It features a 165mm (6.5-inch) mid-bass driver and a 22mm (0.9-inch) dome tweeter, achieving a frequency response of 46Hz-30kHz (+3dB/-6dB). The cabinet dimensions are 201mm wide × 325mm high × 330mm deep, weighing 6.4kg, adopting a relatively large enclosure for its price range. Unique point-to-point bracing technology ensures rigidity with a 12.5-liter internal volume design. With 88dB efficiency and 6-ohm impedance (4-ohm minimum), it is recommended for amplifier driving power of 25-75W.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Objective data exists from multiple third-party measurement institutions, confirming high consistency with claimed specifications. Frequency response measurements demonstrate flat characteristics relative to the 0dB reference line across the 100Hz-20kHz range, with minimal variation even with grille attached. Bass extension down to 46Hz (-6dB) is confirmed through measurements, and the 2.4kHz crossover frequency setting is appropriate. The 88dB efficiency matches measured values, and the 6-ohm/4-ohm minimum load characteristics present no driving difficulties for typical amplifiers. However, specific THD+N numerical data could not be confirmed, limiting scientific verification of distortion characteristics. Overall measured results are good, with audible range performance scientifically substantiated.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 165mm driver represents technology transferred from the 3050i floorstanding speaker, with the impregnated and coated paper cone combined with optimized motor constituting a rational approach. The 22mm tweeter's decoupling design from the front panel is effective from a vibration isolation perspective, representing a technically sound choice. Point-to-point bracing utilizes computer-analyzed optimization design, achieving more effective rigidity than conventional bracing. However, these technologies remain within the application range of existing techniques, with limited innovative elements. From current technological standards, advanced technologies like DSP processing and active control are not adopted, remaining within conventional passive speaker design frameworks.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Q Acoustics 3030i sells for USD 399 (approximately USD 60,000 JPY). Competing products with equivalent 6.5-inch drivers include the Wharfedale Diamond 12.2 at USD 499 and KEF Q350 at USD 500, positioning the 3030i in the lowest price tier. However, the smaller KEF Q150 at USD 350 provides equivalent acoustic performance, while the Monitor Audio Bronze 100 at USD 399 achieves superior low-frequency performance with its 8-inch woofer. CP calculation: 350÷399=0.88, resulting in approximately 12% higher cost compared to the world's cheapest equivalent product. While receiving superior evaluation in midrange expression versus competitors, advantages in pure performance-to-price ratio remain limited.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Q Acoustics, founded in 1996, is a British manufacturer with over 25 years of established reputation. The 3000i series represents a long-selling product line with sustained market availability, establishing reliability credentials. Product warranty periods meet industry standards, with quality control systems from UK headquarters well-established. However, typical overseas manufacturer constraints apply regarding official distributor support in the Japanese market. User reviews report no significant failure patterns, with reliability as a passive speaker meeting general standards. Recently, product transition to the 3000c series positions the 3030i as a discontinued product.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Incorporating a 165mm driver in a bookshelf speaker with a large 12.5-liter enclosure represents a rational choice prioritizing low-frequency performance. Point-to-point bracing for rigidity is physically sound, with measured results supporting this design philosophy. The 2.4kHz crossover frequency setting is appropriate, maximizing driver characteristics. The frequency response characteristics remaining within ±3dB across the audible range represents excellent engineering achievement by speaker standards, where such tolerance is considered standard practice due to physical constraints of acoustic reproduction. While advanced technologies like DSP acoustic field correction and active crossovers are not adopted, the passive design philosophy provides amplifier selection flexibility and long-term reliability. The 330mm depth enclosure, while creating installation constraints, is acoustically justified for achieving the measured low-frequency performance. Overall, the design represents rational optimization within speaker engineering principles.

## Advice

The Q Acoustics 3030i represents a choice for users prioritizing midrange expression capability. While bass extension down to 46Hz (-6dB) and 88dB efficiency enable acoustic performance with medium-sized amplifiers, the KEF Q150 (USD 349.99) provides equivalent overall performance at 12% lower cost than the USD 399 price point. For cost-performance priority, we recommend considering the KEF Q150 first. The price differential can only be justified when finding special value in midrange expression capability. Additionally, consider installation constraints from the 330mm depth large enclosure and the product's movement toward discontinuation.
