## Overview

$$ \Large \text{2.1} $$

The ZiiGaat Estrella is a collaboration between ZiiGaat and Jay's Audio, featuring a hybrid driver configuration with 2×10 mm dynamic drivers and 4 balanced armature drivers per side. Positioned at **299 USD**, it targets listeners seeking powerful bass impact with detailed treble. Premium components include genuine Knowles 29689 and Sonion 2345 full-range BAs plus Sonion E50 super-tweeters with a 3-way crossover and independent sound tubes. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Measurements indicate a strong sub-bass emphasis (≈15 dB), substantially elevating the response below 200 Hz beyond transparency thresholds. Independent THD figures are limited; reports suggest the dual-DD arrangement may introduce distortion at higher levels. Isolation is average for passive IEMs; no ANC. While detail retrieval and stage can surpass some single-driver options, the tuning favors impact over neutrality. [6]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Solid engineering with proven parts (Knowles/Sonion BAs, dual 10 mm PET DDs, 3-way tubes) but no breakthrough innovations. Construction and materials are industry-standard; execution is competent yet conventional.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Including **ultra-budget** options, the **TANGZU Wan'er S.G** (detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin, wired IEM) is available at **19 USD** and measures closer to neutral targets than Estrella, i.e., **equivalent-or-better on FR** while matching core functions. [3][4][5] Thus a cheaper substitute exists with equal-or-better measured performance.

> **CP = MIN(1.0, 19 USD ÷ 299 USD) = 0.063… → 0.1 (rounded to 1 decimal)**

For reference, using the **7Hz Salnotes Zero** at **22.99 USD** yields **22.99 ÷ 299 = 0.077… → 0.1** as well. [7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

ZiiGaat provides a 1-year warranty for the IEM and 3-month coverage for the cable—industry average. Long-term reliability data is still limited for the brand.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design prioritizes an intentionally boosted low end over measured transparency, conflicting with accurate reproduction goals. For high-fidelity use, this is a significant compromise.

## Advice

If you specifically want a bass-forward, fun tuning, Estrella fits that brief. If you value neutrality and measured transparency, prioritize cheaper neutral options like **TANGZU Wan'er S.G** or other neutral-leaning sets first.
