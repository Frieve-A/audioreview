## Overview

The Genelec 8361A is the flagship model in Genelec's "The Ones" series, representing their most advanced coaxial point-source monitor technology. This Finnish-manufactured 3-way active monitor features dual concealed 10" woofers, a coaxial 5" midrange/1" tweeter arrangement, and advanced DSP processing. As part of Genelec's Smart Active Monitoring (SAM) system, it offers sophisticated room calibration capabilities and represents the pinnacle of the company's decades of expertise in professional studio monitoring.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The 8361A demonstrates exceptional performance that targets transparent reproduction. Manufacturer specifications report accuracy of frequency response within ±1.5 dB from 36 Hz to 20 kHz, frequency response of 30 Hz–43 kHz (−6 dB), and short‑term maximum SPL of 118 dB at 1 m [1]. Self‑generated noise is ≤5 dB(A) at 1 m, supporting low noise floor in nearfield operation [1]. Independent retailer technical listings corroborate these key figures (FR 38 Hz–20 kHz ±1.5 dB and SPL 118 dB) [2]. The Minimum Diffraction Coaxial (MDC) point‑source architecture and Directivity Control Waveguide (DCW) enable consistent directivity and imaging. These quantified results align with the site’s transparency criteria for loudspeakers.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Genelec has implemented significant proprietary technology in the 8361A, including their Minimum Diffraction Coaxial driver arrangement and Acoustically Concealed Woofers (ACW) design. The tri-amplified system uses 700W for bass and 150W each for midrange and treble via Class-D PWM amplifiers. Advanced DSP processing enables precise room calibration through the GLM system. The sculpted aluminum Minimum Diffraction Enclosure (MDE) represents sophisticated acoustic engineering. However, while highly refined, the core technologies are evolutionary rather than revolutionary, building upon established principles of coaxial driver design and DSP room correction that other manufacturers also employ.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current US market price for the 8361A is 5,450 USD each [2]. We identified Neumann KH 420 (3‑way active midfield monitor) as an equal‑class alternative in user‑visible functions (active 3‑way, professional monitoring feature set) with comparable output capability and published performance envelope; however, its current market price is 5,599 USD each in the US [3], which is higher than the 8361A. We did not find any cheaper product offering equal‑or‑better user‑facing functions and measured performance. Therefore, per policy, no cheaper equivalent exists and CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Genelec maintains an excellent reputation for build quality and long-term reliability in professional environments. Standard warranty is 2 years, extendable to 5 years with product registration [4]. The company maintains global service networks for professional audio applications. Firmware/software updates are provided for SAM/GLM ecosystems. Finnish manufacturing, robust aluminum enclosures, and long spare‑parts availability policies support durability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Genelec's approach demonstrates strong scientific rationality, prioritizing measured performance optimization and evidence-based engineering. The coaxial design addresses fundamental acoustic principles of point-source reproduction and phase coherence. Room calibration through GLM acknowledges the critical importance of acoustic environment optimization. The focus on achieving transparent level performance in frequency response, distortion, and dynamic range aligns with scientifically meaningful audio reproduction goals. The company's commitment to measurement-based design and rejection of unsubstantiated audio claims reflects rational engineering philosophy focused on audible improvements rather than marketing mythology.

## Advice

For professional studios requiring uncompromising accuracy and maximum output capability, the 8361A delivers world-class measured performance worthy of its flagship positioning. The exceptional spinorama results and low distortion characteristics justify consideration for critical monitoring applications where absolute precision is paramount. Budget-conscious users may consider lower‑priced monitors or used units, but these typically involve trade‑offs (for example, lower maximum SPL, non‑coaxial architecture, or the absence of integrated SAM/GLM room calibration) and therefore do not meet the “equal‑or‑better functions and measured performance” condition. This aligns with the CP = 1.0 assessment above.
