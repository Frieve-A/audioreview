## Overview

The Genelec 8350A is an active bi-amplified studio monitor featuring Smart Active Monitor (SAM) technology. Part of Genelec's professional lineup, it incorporates an 8-inch woofer driven by 200W Class D amplification and a 1-inch metal dome tweeter powered by 150W Class D amplification. The monitor achieves maximum SPL of 112dB and frequency response extending from 33Hz to 22kHz (-6dB). SAM technology enables automatic acoustic calibration through GLM software for room optimization.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate extended bass and high output: frequency response 33 Hz–22 kHz (-6 dB), on-axis accuracy ±1.5 dB (38 Hz–20 kHz), and maximum SPL 112 dB [3]. Group-delay figures published in documentation show ~14 ms at 50 Hz for 8350A (ported alignment) [1][3]. These numbers, alongside SAM/GLM calibration capability, support high objective fidelity for nearfield use. Independent full-chamber measurements are limited; however, the published tolerances and in-room optimization mechanisms justify a high score. THD figures are not comprehensively published; no claims are made beyond typical low-distortion expectations.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 8350A employs DSP-based SAM/GLM room optimization, Genelec’s Directivity Control Waveguide (DCW), die-cast aluminum Minimum Diffraction Enclosure, and dedicated Class D amplification (200 W LF, 150 W HF) [3]. These yield robust, rational engineering without adopting exotic driver topologies. As a two-way SAM monitor (not a “The Ones” coaxial 3-way), sophistication is high but not category-leading in architecture.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator: Neumann KH 150 (DSP monitor with auto-alignment via MA 1, linear FR 39 Hz–21 kHz, high SPL, professional I/O) at 1,750 USD each [5]. Review target market price: 2,595 USD each [4]. Calculation: 1,750 USD ÷ 2,595 USD = 0.674 → 0.7. Functions are comparable from a user perspective (DSP room calibration, pro connectivity, high linearity); the comparator is cheaper while achieving state-of-the-art measured linearity and high output.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Genelec maintains an excellent reputation for reliability, documentation, and worldwide service. Warranty extends to 5 years upon registration, and SAM monitors are supported by long-lived software and firmware ecosystems [3]. Build quality (die-cast aluminum, protection circuitry) suits mission-critical use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design targets measurable transparency: controlled directivity (DCW), flat response within tight tolerances, and DSP calibration addressing room-induced errors. Emphasis on objective optimization over cosmetic features is highly rational for professional monitoring [3].

## Advice

The 8350A offers excellent engineering, controlled directivity, and SAM/GLM integration. If you already run a Genelec/SAM ecosystem or need the specific integration/workflow, it is a strong choice. If price-to-performance is paramount and DSP auto-alignment is required, consider Neumann KH 150 (requires MA 1) at a lower unit price while delivering reference-grade linearity [5]. For budget-only cases where room correction is not mandatory, ADAM T8V provides large-woofer output at a fraction of the cost but lacks monitor-integrated DSP calibration [2].
