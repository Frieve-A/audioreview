## Overview

The Genelec 8351B is a 3-way coaxial active nearfield monitor developed by the Finnish professional audio manufacturer, Genelec. It incorporates the company's SAM (Smart Active Monitor) technology and achieves ideal acoustic radiation characteristics close to a point source through its MDC (Minimum Diffraction Coaxial) driver and ACW (Acoustically Concealed Woofers) design. Building on the previous 8351A, improvements include an enhanced driver and increased output. In conjunction with the GLM calibration system, it enables high-precision monitoring in any listening environment. It boasts extremely flat performance with a maximum SPL of 113 dB and a frequency response of 38Hz-20kHz (±1.5dB), making it specialized for use in professional studio environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The frequency response of 38Hz-20kHz (±1.5dB) is an exceptionally good value from a scientific standpoint. While it does not reach the standard for acoustic transparency (±0.5dB), it is well below the threshold for perceptible frequency response anomalies (±1.0dB) across most of the audible spectrum. The coaxial driver and GLM-based DSP correction are a particularly scientifically valid approach, as they optimize not only the on-axis response but also the overall frequency and phase response, including room reflections. Distortion is also kept extremely low across all frequencies, placing its fidelity to the master source in the top class.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design of "The Ones" series, combining an MDC (Minimum Diffraction Coaxial) driver and ACW (Acoustically Concealed Woofers), is extremely advanced from an acoustic engineering perspective. By assigning the mid and high frequencies to the coaxial driver and the low frequencies to woofers integrated with the enclosure, it achieves a perfect point source and controls directivity across the entire frequency range. Furthermore, the GLM (Genelec Loudspeaker Manager) software's automatic room correction function, which integrally performs everything from individual driver characteristic correction to room acoustic correction, surpasses other companies' approaches and represents the highest level of technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The market price for the 8351B is 4,267 USD per unit. As a comparison, the Neumann KH 310 A, another high-performance 3-way active monitor, is available for 2,333 USD per unit. The KH 310 A covers a wider frequency range of 34Hz-21kHz (±3dB) and features a sealed enclosure design for excellent transient response. The 8351B holds unique value in its point-source reproduction via coaxial design and advanced DSP correction through GLM, but the KH 310 A also boasts extremely high fundamental performance. In a cost-effectiveness calculation, 2,333 USD / 4,267 USD ≈ 0.55, resulting in a rounded score of 0.5. While the advanced technology of the 8351B provides value commensurate with its price, it is also true that other high-performance monitors exist at a lower price point.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Founded in 1978, Genelec is a veteran Finnish pro-audio manufacturer with a long track record of being adopted in professional studios worldwide. The product failure rate is extremely low, and they are known for their robust die-cast aluminum enclosures that withstand long-term use. A solid support system is established through authorized distributors in Japan, ensuring prompt and appropriate repairs and technical support. Product-specific management is also thorough thanks to SAM technology, and quality control is at the highest level. The GLM software is also regularly updated, maintaining long-term product value.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design philosophy of the 8351B demonstrates exceptional rationality through its scientific approach to acoustic engineering. The coaxial driver design addresses fundamental issues in multi-driver speaker systems by creating a true point source, eliminating time alignment problems and phase issues. The GLM room correction system represents a rational approach to the reality that most listening environments are acoustically imperfect. The DSP-based correction methodology is grounded in measurable acoustic principles rather than subjective preferences. The product's focus on measurement-based optimization rather than marketing-driven features shows a design philosophy that prioritizes objective performance over subjective appeal.

## Advice

The 8351B is a top-tier product in terms of measurement performance and technological sophistication, but a price of 8,533 USD for a pair requires careful consideration. Its value lies in the environmental adaptability provided by GLM and the extremely accurate sound imaging from its coaxial design. For professional studios where these features are essential, or for use in acoustically challenging rooms, it offers an irreplaceable investment value. However, if room correction is less critical or if an external DSP is used, excellent alternatives like the Neumann KH 310 A exist. The KH 310 A boasts extremely high fidelity despite its traditional design. It is crucial to audition both products before purchase and coolly evaluate whether the improvements offered by GLM justify the price difference.
