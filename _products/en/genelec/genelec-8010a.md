## Overview

The Genelec 8010A is a compact 3-inch bi-amplified active studio monitor designed for near-field monitoring in space-constrained environments. It employs dual 25 W Class-D amplifiers for a 3-inch woofer and 0.75-inch metal-dome tweeter in an aluminum die-cast enclosure, and uses Genelec’s Directivity Control Waveguide (DCW) with simple room-response switches [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Objectively, the 8010A’s manufacturer-published response is 74 Hz–20 kHz (±2.5 dB) with low-frequency extension to 67 Hz at −6 dB and a maximum short-term SPL of 96 dB at 1 m (per pair) [1]. Independent Klippel NFS–based data aggregated from ASR yields a predicted preference score of **5.08** (and **7.99** with a subwoofer) and places the −3 dB/−6 dB points around **77.6 Hz / 71.8 Hz**, confirming limited bass headroom typical for this size [3]. Within its intended near-field use the midband linearity is decent, but extension/output constraints prevent transparency at higher levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design shows mature engineering for a micro monitor: DCW directivity control, rigid die-cast MDE enclosure, protection/ISS auto-standby, and per-driver amplification. Layout and acoustic shaping are at an in-house, pro-grade level [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better): **JBL 305P MkII**. Rationale (minimum equivalence note): active 5-inch two-way with broader usable bandwidth and competent directivity; third-party Klippel NFS tests show generally flat on-axis response, good radiation behavior, and output limited only by DSP above ~96 dB—overall equal-or-better for near-field fidelity metrics [6].

- Target price (denominator): **395 USD each** → **790 USD/pair** [4].
- Cheapest equal-or-better price (numerator): **159 USD each** → **318 USD/pair** [5][11].

**CP calculation:** 318 ÷ 790 = **0.40** → score **0.4**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Baseline warranty is 2 years worldwide, with a **5-year** total warranty available via registration (parts **and** labour since 2023) [7][8]. Genelec’s long serviceability record and global distributor network support the durability implied by the aluminum enclosure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Prioritizing portability and controlled directivity in a palm-sized form is coherent. However, unavoidable 3-inch limits on LF extension and max SPL cap scientific performance; pricing does not disrupt the market on transparency metrics.

## Advice

Choose the 8010A when ultra-small footprint, rugged build, and controlled directivity at desk distance are must-haves. For neutral work at typical 1 m distances and moderate levels, it functions well; for higher output or deeper bass, factor a subwoofer or step up in size. Budget-constrained buyers focused purely on measured fidelity should consider larger 5-inch options like the 305P MkII instead [6].
