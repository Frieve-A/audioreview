## Overview

The Genelec 8320A is a 4-inch 2-way active studio monitor from Genelec, a Finnish professional audio manufacturer established in 1978. It incorporates Smart Active Monitor (SAM) technology with automatic calibration via GLM (Genelec Loudspeaker Manager) software. The frequency response is 55Hz-23kHz (±1.5dB), powering a 4-inch woofer and 3/4-inch metal dome tweeter with 50W Class-D amplifiers each. The aluminum die-cast enclosure and Directivity Control Waveguide minimize diffraction and reflection.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The frequency response of 55Hz-23kHz (±1.5dB) is strong for a 4-inch monitor. Measurements from Audio Science Review indicate low distortion at 86dBSPL, with increases at 96dBSPL. SAM technology provides measurement-based correction, but it cannot exceed the physical limits of the 4-inch driver. The 3kHz active crossover is suitable, and the maximum SPL of 107dB is adequate for a compact monitor. While specific THD and SNR figures are unpublished, audible range transparency is anticipated based on Genelec's product standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

SAM technology and GLM software for automatic calibration are advanced in the industry. The setup with 50W Class-D amplifiers per driver is efficient, and the aluminum die-cast Minimum Diffraction Enclosure is an acoustically superior design. Directivity Control Waveguide for controlled dispersion is technically advanced. However, core driver technology and enclosure design align with industry norms, with proprietary innovations primarily in digital processing. The overall technical integration merits high regard.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At a market price of approximately 800 USD per unit, the Kali Audio LP-6 v2 (approximately 200 USD per unit) offers comparable or superior functionality and performance. 200 USD ÷ 800 USD = 0.25, allowing access to equivalent active monitor features, including room correction via optional software, at about 25% of the cost. The LP-6 v2 provides XLR connectivity, 80W output, 45Hz-21kHz (±3dB) frequency response, and higher maximum SPL of 115dB, with boundary EQ comparable to Genelec's SAM in functionality. This leads to a low assessment in terms of functionality and measured performance versus price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Genelec, founded in 1978 as a Finnish professional audio maker, holds high industry reliability. Product failure rates are below average, with suitable warranty periods. Quality control at the Finnish headquarters is robust, supported by global sales and service networks. Firmware updates for SAM technology are regularly issued, ensuring long-term usability. This represents standard industry excellence rather than exceptional support relative to price.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Measurement-driven automatic calibration is a scientifically sound method. SAM technology applies frequency response correction and level adjustments based on data, achieving objective acoustic optimization without subjective tweaks. The active design with per-driver amplification is theoretically effective. Minimum Diffraction Enclosure and waveguide follow acoustic engineering principles. However, low-frequency reproduction limits under 4-inch constraints and the need for dedicated hardware versus general PC and DAC/amplifier setups raise questions.

## Advice

The Genelec 8320A is a technically solid studio monitor, but cost-performance warrants careful evaluation. It suits those prioritizing SAM's automatic correction and Genelec's reliability, but for comparable or better features at lower cost, consider alternatives like the Kali Audio LP-6 v2. The LP-6 v2 includes XLR connectivity, boundary EQ, and higher SPL, delivering similar or superior functionality at about 25% of the price. For beginners or budget-focused users, starting with the LP-6 v2 to gain experience before upgrading is practical. The premium is justified only in professional scenarios requiring Genelec's precision and brand consistency.
