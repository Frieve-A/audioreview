## Overview

The Genelec W371A is an adaptive low-frequency woofer system designed to complement The Ones (8341A, 8351B, 8361A). It combines a sealed 14-inch front woofer and a ported 12-inch rear woofer, each with 400 W Class-D amplification (800 W total), and operates from 23 Hz to 500 Hz (-6 dB), specified ±3 dB from 25-450 Hz, with a 120 dB max SPL [1][3]. Via GLM, users can select Complementary, Directive, or Null-steering directivity modes for room-aware LF control [2]. The W371A/8351B system won the 2021 TEC Award (Studio Monitor) [6].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Within its 25-450 Hz ±3 dB specified band and up to 120 dB SPL, the W371A provides measurable, audibly relevant LF extension and headroom [1][3]. Manufacturer data lists THD ≤0.5% and user-selectable directivity modes that reduce room-bound LF interactions (e.g., Null-steering toward boundaries) [2][3]. Independent third-party lab measurements of the W371A itself remain limited; therefore, this section references manufacturer specs corroborated by reputable coverage [5]. Given the objective LF control functions and published figures, a 0.8 score is warranted.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The dual-woofer (sealed + reflex) topology with per-driver DSP enables controllable directivity up to the 150-300 Hz crossover region, integrating with GLM for measurement-based alignment [2]. This is an advanced, original implementation of room-interactive LF radiation control in a free-standing module, comparable in ambition to cardioid/boundary-independent LF solutions seen in full systems like Kii Three BXT [8]. Execution quality and integration depth justify 0.9.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current US market price is 9,895 USD per unit [4]. We found no cheaper **dedicated** LF extension product offering user-selectable LF directivity up to ~300-500 Hz with comparable published performance and GLM-class calibration. Notably, Kii's BXT achieves cardioid low-frequency directivity but is sold as part of the Three/BXT system at substantially higher system pricing, not as a cheaper single-module alternative [8]. As no lower-priced equivalent-or-better option is available, CP = 1.0 (explicitly: the review target is the cheapest among equivalent-or-better options).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Genelec offers a 2-year parts-and-labour warranty extendable to 5 years upon free registration, backed by global service infrastructure [7]. GLM software continues to receive updates, and the operating manual documents robust protections and ISS power-saving features [2]. The combination of warranty policy and mature support ecosystem justifies 0.9.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The W371A's rationale is strictly measurement-driven: it applies DSP-controlled radiation patterns to mitigate room effects where LF problems dominate, and it integrates via GLM measurement/optimization [1][2]. The approach targets audibly significant parameters (LF response and modal interaction) rather than cosmetic or purely subjective claims, meriting 0.9.

## Advice

If you already use The Ones and require main-monitor-grade LF control without wall-mounting or soffiting, the W371A delivers rare capabilities: measured LF extension, high output, and switchable directivity modes that meaningfully reduce boundary interactions in real rooms [1][2]. Budget for **one unit per channel** and plan on GLM calibration (GLM kit is bundled when purchasing two W371As, or available separately) [2][3]. Competing solutions with comparable LF directivity exist mainly as whole systems (e.g., Kii Three BXT), typically at higher total cost and without drop-in compatibility with The Ones [8].
