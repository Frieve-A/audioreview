## Overview

The Genelec 8341A is a 3-way active studio monitor developed by the veteran Finnish speaker manufacturer Genelec. Featuring the company's proprietary SAM (Smart Active Monitor) technology, it employs a coaxial driver configuration for a point source design. The unique structure embeds the tweeter within the midwoofer, complemented by two dedicated bass woofers, achieving ideal stereo imaging that was previously difficult for conventional studio monitors. Combined with GLM (Genelec Loudspeaker Manager) software, it provides room correction functionality as a high-end unit for professional applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Genelec 8341A's measurement performance reaches industry-leading standards. It achieves an extremely wide frequency response of 38Hz-37kHz (-6dB) with near-transparent flatness of ±1.5dB in the 45Hz-20kHz range. Independent measurements by Audio Science Review earned evaluations of "nearly perfect performance" and "technically excellent," with listening window flatness approaching the limits of measurement equipment. The maximum SPL of 110dB provides sufficient output for a mid-size monitor, and total harmonic distortion measurements are also exceptionally good. The coaxial design's ability to match directivity characteristics in both vertical and horizontal directions also solves a key challenge of traditional multi-way speakers.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The 8341A boasts an extremely high technical standard. ACW (Acoustically Concealed Woofers) technology extends the concept of coaxial acoustic radiation to low frequencies, allowing the entire front baffle to function as a massive DCW (Directivity Control Waveguide). The 3-way configuration crosses over at 500Hz and 3kHz, employing a tri-amped system with dedicated amplifiers for each driver (250W bass, 150W mid, 150W treble). The advanced DSP processing through SAM technology and room correction capabilities via GLM software are proprietary, industry-leading technologies. Achieving a point source design is an extremely difficult challenge in acoustic engineering, but Genelec has accomplished this at a practical level through years of research and development.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 8341A's price of 787,600 yen per pair is high. An alternative providing equivalent measurement performance (frequency response, SPL, distortion, low-frequency extension) is the Neumann KH 150 pair (406,000 yen). Despite being a high-performance 2-way monitor with a larger woofer and DSP, the KH 150 achieves comparable overall performance to the 8341A. The cost-performance calculation is: 406,000 yen ÷ 787,600 yen = 0.51, meaning the 8341A offers similar performance at approximately twice the price. The directivity advantage of the coaxial design is clear, but whether its value justifies the price difference requires careful consideration.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Genelec, founded in 1978 with headquarters in Finland, is a veteran speaker manufacturer boasting industry-leading reliability. The company's products are used in professional studios worldwide and are known for their robustness to withstand long-term, heavy use. Comprehensive support systems are established through authorized dealers in major markets, ensuring prompt repair and maintenance. Continuous firmware updates are provided for SAM technology-compatible products, and the GLM software is also regularly updated. With numerous TEC Awards, the manufacturer enjoys an extremely high reputation in the industry.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The 8341A's design philosophy is an extremely rational approach based on scientific evidence. Achieving ideal stereo imaging through a point source design, providing measurement-based room correction, and ensuring accurate frequency and phase characteristics via DSP are all technologies with clear, acoustically expected benefits. The matching of vertical and horizontal directivity through the coaxial arrangement also provides a practically important improvement. SAM technology is not merely a marketing term but an implementation whose effects are verifiable with measurement data. There is no adherence to legacy analog circuits or unscientific claims, representing a design purely aimed at improving measured performance.

## Advice

The Genelec 8341A is an exceptionally fine studio monitor, boasting industry-leading standards in measurement performance, technology level, and reliability. The precise imaging and superior directivity, unique to its coaxial point-source design, are particularly valuable in critical listening applications such as mastering and immersive audio production. However, from a cost-performance perspective, a more careful evaluation is warranted. Considering that the Neumann KH 150, which offers comparable overall measurement performance, is available for about half the price, the choice of the 8341A hinges on whether one finds its unique acoustical advantages to be worth the additional investment of approximately 380,000 yen. It is highly recommended for well-funded professionals seeking the highest standard in point-source monitoring, but for many users, alternatives will present a very compelling option.
