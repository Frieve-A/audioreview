## Overview

The Genelec G Two is a 4-inch 2-way active monitor speaker designed and manufactured by the Finnish pro audio manufacturer Genelec. It features a 4.1-inch polypropylene cone woofer and a 0.75-inch metal dome tweeter, each driven by Class D amplifiers. It adopts a die-cast aluminum enclosure, equipped with RCA inputs and adjustment switches for room acoustics. It is intended for a wide range of uses from desktop audio to professional applications. It condenses Genelec's traditional solid design philosophy into a compact enclosure.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The G Two demonstrates good measurement performance for a 4-inch class. The frequency response is 56 Hz - 25 kHz -6 dB, 62 Hz - 20 kHz ±2.5 dB, which is reasonable for a small speaker. The maximum SPL achieves 100 dB, providing sufficient sound pressure level for desktop use. The die-cast aluminum enclosure effectively suppresses resonance, and the active design with direct driver connection reduces distortion. However, the low-frequency extension to 56 Hz is standard compared to competitors in the same size range (KRK GoAux 4 at about 60 Hz, PreSonus Eris E4.5 at 70 Hz). Specific harmonic distortion values are not publicly available, but based on Genelec's quality standards and third-party measurements, it is estimated to be below 1%, which is a good level in the speaker category.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The G Two has an industry-average technology level. The die-cast aluminum enclosure is effective for resonance suppression, and the adoption of Class D amplifiers achieves efficient drive. The active crossover design eliminates losses from passive components and directly connects optimized amplifiers to each driver. The metal dome tweeter ensures high-frequency extension. However, it lacks modern technologies such as DSP processing, room correction functions, and Bluetooth connectivity, remaining with a basic analog circuit configuration. The driver technology also lacks particularly innovative elements, being a solid combination of conventional technologies. Compared to competitors in the same price range, technological superiority is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The cost-performance of the G Two must be evaluated as extremely low. The current market price is about 880 USD per pair (440 USD per unit). The Yamaha HS4, with equivalent functions and measurement performance, is available for about 200 USD per pair, and the calculation "200 USD ÷ 880 USD = 0.227" results in a rounded score of 0.2. Furthermore, there are multiple products with equivalent or better functions at lower prices, such as the KRK GoAux 4 (about 552 USD, with auto room correction and Bluetooth) and the JBL One Series 104 (about 114 USD). Comparison with the cheapest JBL 104 gives "114 USD ÷ 880 USD = 0.130", rounding to a score of 0.1. In the current situation where it does not show clear superiority in measurement performance or functionality, justifying the price difference is difficult.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Genelec is a manufacturer with high reliability in the industry. It has a strict quality control system through in-house production in Finland and a long track record in the pro audio industry. A 5-year warranty is provided upon product registration, which exceeds industry standards and offers substantial support. The die-cast aluminum enclosure has minimal degradation over long-term use, and the active circuits are composed of high-reliability components. New purchases are possible, allowing enjoyment of the benefits of long-term support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design philosophy of the G Two is basically rational. The active design eliminates losses from passive crossovers and improves efficiency and accuracy by directly connecting optimized amplifiers to each driver. It adopts designs based on physical grounds, such as resonance suppression with a die-cast aluminum enclosure, appropriate driver placement, and adjustment functions for room acoustic characteristics. Genelec maintains a scientific approach that emphasizes measurement data and is not swayed by audio myths, which is commendable. However, from a modern perspective, technical conservatism stands out, such as the lack of further accuracy improvement through DSP processing, non-support for digital inputs, and absence of smart functions. Additionally, in the current situation where many competitors achieve equivalent performance at lower prices, questions remain about the necessity of its existence as dedicated audio equipment.

## Advice

The G Two is a product with a certain level of quality in measurement performance and reliability, but it is a choice that is difficult to recommend. The biggest issue is the extremely low cost-performance, with a price difference of 4-8 times compared to the Yamaha HS4 or KRK GoAux 4 that cannot be justified. New purchases are possible, but it is traded at high prices even in the used market, offering no price advantage. For those considering desktop audio or small studio use, we strongly recommend first considering current products such as the Yamaha HS4 (about 200 USD/pair, excellent measurement performance), KRK GoAux 4 (about 552 USD/pair, equipped with auto room correction), and JBL One Series 104 (about 114 USD/pair, cost-performance oriented). Unless there is dissatisfaction with the sound quality or functions of these products, there is no rational reason to choose the G Two.
