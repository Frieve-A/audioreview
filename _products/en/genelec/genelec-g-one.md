rating: [3.9, 0.6, 0.7, 1.0, 0.8, 0.8]
price: 395
summary: "Ultra-compact active monitor with proven pro-grade design. Excellent mid/high linearity but limited bass extension; no cheaper equivalent currently exists, so CP=1.0."

## Overview

The Genelec G-One is the smallest home-audio model derived from Genelec’s pro 8000 series. It shares the **same enclosure concept (die-cast aluminium MDE), driver sizes (76 mm woofer / 19 mm metal-dome), amplifier ratings (25 W + 25 W Class-D), published frequency accuracy (±2.5 dB, 74 Hz–20 kHz)** and **short-term max SPL (96 dB)** with the pro **8010A**, indicating **effectively equivalent acoustics**. The primary user-facing difference is **RCA input on G-One vs XLR on 8010A**[1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Manufacturer specs** report **74 Hz–20 kHz (±2.5 dB)**, **–6 dB points at 67 Hz / 25 kHz**, **short-term max SPL 96 dB @ 1 m**, **self-noise ≤5 dB(A)**, **THD ≤3% (70–400 Hz) / ≤0.5% (>400 Hz)**, and a **3 kHz crossover**[1]. The 8010A posts the same headline figures[2].  
Given the 3-inch woofer, **bass extension is inherently limited to the mid-70 Hz region**, so a subwoofer is recommended for full-range playback. Independent lab data specific to the G-One is scarce; this section therefore relies on **manufacturer-published figures** pending broader third-party measurements[1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Genelec applies its **DCW waveguide**, **die-cast aluminium cabinet**, **dedicated Class-D amps per driver**, protection, and desk/wall EQ switches—**well-proven pro techniques** in a micro form factor. The 3 kHz crossover is a sensible integration point[1]. Solid, modern engineering rather than bleeding-edge novelty.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The **cheapest equivalent-or-better** comparator is the **Genelec 8010A**. As of this review, US market prices are **G-One: 395 USD each**[5] and **8010A: 395 USD each**[6]. Since **no cheaper equivalent exists**, **CP is 1.0** (clamped). Equivalence basis: **same driver sizes, published frequency accuracy (±2.5 dB, 74 Hz–20 kHz), and short-term max SPL (96 dB)**; the only practical difference is **RCA vs XLR input**[1][2].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Genelec’s pro heritage and **aluminium enclosure** suggest strong durability. **Standard warranty is 2 years**, **extendable to 5 years (parts & labour) with free registration**[7][8]. Global service coverage and spares support are mature.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The focus on **measured accuracy and controlled directivity** over “voicing” is rational for nearfield work. Active topology removes amp-matching variables and improves **repeatability** of results[1].

## Advice

Choose the G-One if you need **RCA connectivity** and accurate **mid/high performance** in a tiny footprint. Add a **subwoofer** for wide-band listening. If XLR is acceptable, the **8010A** offers **the same performance at the same price** in the US—pick by connectivity.
