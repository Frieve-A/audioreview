## Overview

The Genelec 7370A is a 12-inch active studio subwoofer that combines the Laminar Spiral Enclosure (LSE) with Smart Active Monitoring (SAM) and GLM calibration for precise integration in stereo and multichannel systems[1]. **For category consistency, this review records pair pricing (two units).**

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comprehensive third-party measurements are not publicly available; therefore the score starts from a neutral 0.5 baseline and will be revised when independent data emerges. Manufacturer specs show 19–100 Hz (±3 dB), -6 dB points at 19–150 Hz, short-term max 113 dB SPL, self-noise ≤5 dB SPL, and 2nd harmonic ≤3% from 30–85 Hz, which meet professional monitoring needs[1]. GLM’s phase/level/crossover alignment is a scientifically grounded way to improve system transparency.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Genelec’s LSE minimizes turbulence, the optimized Class-D amplification and protection are robust, and the SAM+GLM ecosystem enables networked calibration and bass management. AES/EBU I/O and 7.1 analog I/O add flexibility for complex rigs[1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better alternative**: **Neumann KH 750 DSP ×2 + MA 1** (DSP subwoofers with bass management and automated alignment)[4][5].  
**Prices (US market)**: 7370A pair **8,100 USD** (4,050 USD each)[2]. Alternative **3,645 USD** (KH 750 + MA 1 bundle **1,895 USD** + KH 750 **1,750 USD**)[4][3].  
**Calculation**: 3,645 USD ÷ 8,100 USD = **0.45** → round to one decimal → **0.5**.  
The Genelec pair remains a premium choice justified by integration headroom and output capability; the Neumann configuration is markedly cheaper for comparable automated alignment and bass management.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Rugged build, mature protection schemes, a global support network, and ongoing GLM updates underpin high reliability for 24/7 professional use[1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design prioritizes measurable system-level gains—alignment, phase coherence, and consistent LF translation—over cosmetic features. It is a rational route to transparent monitoring in real rooms[1].

## Advice

Choose the 7370A pair when you need higher SPL headroom, seamless GLM integration across large rooms, or complex multichannel bass management. If budget is critical and you still need DSP alignment and bass management, **KH 750 DSP ×2 + MA 1** offers excellent value[3][4][5].
