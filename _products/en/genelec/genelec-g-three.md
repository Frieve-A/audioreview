## Overview

The Genelec G Three is a 5-inch 2-way active monitor speaker designed and manufactured by Genelec, the established Finnish professional audio manufacturer. It features a 130mm polypropylene cone woofer and 19mm aluminum dome tweeter, each driven by 50W Class D amplifiers. The speaker incorporates Genelec's decades of professional monitor development expertise through a cast aluminum enclosure, active crossover, and custom-designed amplifiers. Equipped with RCA and XLR inputs, it supports diverse installation options including desktop, wall mount, and ceiling mount configurations. The product is designed for wide-ranging applications from home audio to professional studio use.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

According to Stereophile's measurement data, the G Three demonstrates extremely excellent measurement performance. The frequency response measures 54Hz-20kHz ±2.5dB as per official specifications, achieving ±1.5dB precision in the 300Hz-20kHz range on the optimal measurement axis. Total harmonic distortion remains below 0.5% above 100Hz and below 2% in the 50-100Hz range, reaching excellent levels for the speaker category. The crossover transition at 3kHz is smooth, showcasing the advantages of active design in measurement results. These measurement values represent levels that provide audibly meaningful improvements, enabling high-transparency acoustic reproduction. However, it falls short of the transparency level of ±1dB or better in frequency response, and its bass extension is limited to 54Hz.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The G Three possesses technology levels above the industry average. The cast aluminum enclosure effectively suppresses resonance, while the internally designed Class D amplifiers are optimized for each driver. The active crossover design eliminates losses and phase characteristic degradation from passive components. The combination of a 130mm woofer and 19mm tweeter is appropriately designed, with the 3kHz crossover frequency being rational. However, the driver technology itself is not particularly innovative, and Class D amplifiers are now common technology. Compared to the company's higher-end models, advanced technologies such as DSP processing and room correction functions are not implemented. Technically, it represents a solid, reliability-focused design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The G Three's cost-performance must be evaluated as extremely low. At a Japanese market price of 195,800 JPY per pair, the JBL 305P MkII with equivalent functionality and measurement performance is available for 29,600 JPY per pair. Based on the calculation "29,600 JPY ÷ 195,800 JPY = 0.151", the score is 0.2. In terms of measurement performance, the JBL 305P MkII is comparable or even partially superior to the G Three, especially in frequency response flatness and low-frequency extension, with no inferiority in functionality. The similarly high-performing Adam Audio T5V is also available for 57,200 JPY per pair. Excluding the Genelec brand premium, other options are overwhelmingly superior in the pure performance-to-price ratio.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Genelec provides industry-leading reliability and support systems. Quality control through in-house production in Finland is extremely rigorous, with an extensive track record in the professional audio industry. Product registration provides 5-year warranty coverage, significantly exceeding the industry standard of 2-3 years. The cast aluminum enclosure experiences minimal deterioration during long-term use, while active circuits utilize high-reliability components. Distributor support systems are well-established, with comprehensive failure response and repair services. The speakers possess the robustness to withstand harsh professional use and can be expected to operate stably over extended periods.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The G Three's design philosophy is extremely rational and scientific. The active design directly connects amplifiers optimized for each driver, eliminating losses and phase issues from passive crossovers. Measurement-based audio tuning, resonance suppression through the cast aluminum enclosure, and appropriate crossover frequency selection are all grounded in physical principles. Genelec also functions as a measurement equipment manufacturer, maintaining an approach unswayed by unscientific audio mythology. However, from a contemporary perspective, the absence of DSP processing for further precision improvement and room correction functionality could be considered somewhat conservative.

## Advice

While the G Three is a professional-grade monitor speaker with excellent measurement performance and high reliability, it is difficult to recommend from a cost-performance perspective. Given that the JBL 305P MkII offers equivalent functionality and performance at approximately 1/6.6th the price, and the Adam Audio T5V at 1/3.4th the price, it cannot be considered a rational choice unless there is a strong commitment to the Genelec brand. If considering a purchase, carefully evaluate whether you can truly find 195,800 JPY worth of value in Genelec's added benefits (extended warranty, brand reliability, Finnish manufacturing quality). It is recommended only for professional studio use or for cases where long-term stable operation is the highest priority and the budget allows. For typical home audio applications, alternative products should be considered first, with this positioned as a final option only if you are dissatisfied with their sound quality or functionality.
