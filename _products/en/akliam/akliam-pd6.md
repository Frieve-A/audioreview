## Overview

The Akliam PD6 is a portable USB DAC/amp featuring the ESS ES9039Q2M DAC chip and dual RT6863 operational amplifiers. Despite its lightweight 23g design, it provides both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs, supporting high-resolution audio sources up to 768kHz/32bit PCM and DSD512. The device features a 0.87-inch OLED display for settings adjustment, 8 filter options, 100-step volume control, high/low gain switching, and various advanced functions. Built around the ES9039Q2M chip's impressive specifications of SNR 133dB and THD+N -123dB (official specs), the design delivers high audio quality potential, though actual implementation performance varies by product. The device is sold for around 55 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The ES9039Q2M DAC chip demonstrates excellent measured performance with official specifications of SNR 133dB and THD+N -123dB (1kHz), representing a high-performance chip. The HyperStream IV architecture and dual modulator configuration provide capabilities that significantly exceed the transparency thresholds (SNR 105dB+, THD 0.01% or below). Combined with RT6863 operational amplifiers, both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs achieve low-distortion amplification, delivering audible sound quality improvements for many headphones and earphones. While actual implementation performance varies by product, this represents a high audio quality potential configuration for its price range. The transition from the previous PD5's AK4493SEQ to the more neutral ES9039Q2M achieves more technical and transparent sound quality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ES9039Q2M DAC chip is a high-performance 32-bit DAC with impressive specifications including 768kHz PCM and DSD512 support. The adoption of RT6863 operational amplifiers achieves amplification circuitry equivalent to the iBasso DC04 Pro. Implementation of the CT7601PR audio bridge controller and 0.87-inch OLED display represents an advanced technical configuration considering the price range. Software features are comprehensive, including UAC1.0/2.0 support, 8 filter functions, and 100-step volume adjustment. However, the design fundamentally combines existing ICs with limited proprietary development technology. More innovative approaches like the FiiO KA17 or dual DAC configurations are not present. While meeting industry-standard technical levels, no technological breakthroughs are included.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

In comparison with competing products offering equivalent functionality and measured performance, the PD6 demonstrates exceptionally excellent cost-performance. Among products meeting all functional and performance requirements—including dual 3.5mm/4.4mm outputs, high output driving power, an OLED display, 768kHz/DSD512 support, and the high performance of the ES9039Q2M DAC—the PD6 (55 USD) is effectively the most affordable option. For instance, the iBasso DC04 Pro (119 USD) has excellent measured values but costs more than twice as much. Therefore, as the review target is the world's most affordable option with equivalent functionality and measured performance, the score is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Akliam is an emerging audio manufacturer that has gained attention in recent years, maintaining an official store on AliExpress and developing a broad product lineup from desktop DACs and amplifiers to portable devices. Previous models including PD5, PD4 Plus, and PD3 have received favorable evaluations, confirming a continuous product development structure. The PD6 has also received positive initial market reactions, with reviews calling it "one of the best neutral sound DACs." However, with a short establishment history, long-term failure rates and RMA response records remain unclear. Information regarding warranty periods and repair systems is limited, and comprehensive support systems like those of major manufacturers cannot be expected. This represents average support levels for an emerging manufacturer.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The PD6's design philosophy aims for scientific sound quality improvement and is fundamentally rational. The transition from the previous PD5's AK4493SEQ to the more neutral ES9039Q2M represents a shift from "musical expression" to "technical transparency," deserving evaluation as a measurement-focused approach. The combination with RT6863 operational amplifiers directly contributes to measured performance improvements, and balanced output implementation is practical. The OLED display settings adjustment function represents a rational choice contributing to improved usability. However, the eight digital filter options have limited practical utility due to negligible audible differences. Nevertheless, the measurement data-focused design approach can be considered scientifically rational.

## Advice

The Akliam PD6 is suitable for users requiring 4.4mm balanced output and high driving power in a portable DAC/amp. The excellent performance of the ES9039Q2M DAC chip, achieving transparency-level sound quality potential for 55 USD, is highly commendable and fully capable of drawing out the abilities of medium-to-high impedance headphones and balanced-drive compatible earphones. The shift from the previous PD5 model to a more technical and transparent sound is particularly recommended for users seeking such qualities. The OLED display's visibility is also practical. However, if your earphones are highly sensitive and do not require high power, or if you do not need 4.4mm balanced output, more affordable options may be considered. Conversely, if you seek higher measured performance, investing in a higher-tier model like the iBasso DC04 Pro should be considered. Currently, as the most affordable option with equivalent functionality and measured performance, this product is strongly recommended for cost-performance-focused users.
