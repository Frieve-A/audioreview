## Overview

The Akliam PD5 is a portable USB DAC/amp featuring the AKM AK4493SEQ DAC chip and dual RT6863 operational amplifiers. Despite its lightweight 21g design, it offers both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs, supporting high-resolution audio up to 768kHz/32bit PCM and DSD512. It includes versatile features such as 6 filter options, 60-step volume adjustment, and high/low gain switching. The measurement performance achieves 125dB SNR, -115dB THD+N, and 255mW@32Ω output power through the 4.4mm balanced output. It is available for around 68 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The AK4493SEQ DAC chip demonstrates excellent official specifications with 123dB SNR (2Vrms), 125dB (2.7Vrms), and -113dB THD+N. The implemented PD5 achieves 120dB SNR on its 3.5mm output, 125dB on the 4.4mm balanced output, and THD+N ranging from -108dB to -115dB, significantly exceeding the transparency level criteria (105dB+ SNR, 0.01% THD or below). Output power of 130mW on 3.5mm and 255mW@32Ω on 4.4mm balanced provides sufficient driving capability, enabling audible sound quality improvements for most headphones and earphones. Channel crosstalk of -72dB to -135dB is also excellent, contributing to improved stereo imaging. The background noise is extremely low, with no audible hiss even with high-sensitivity IEMs, demonstrating an excellent design.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The AK4493SEQ DAC chip is a high-performance 32-bit DAC with advanced specifications supporting 768kHz PCM and DSD512. The adoption of RT6863 operational amplifiers achieves amplification circuitry equivalent to the iBasso DC04 Pro. It features an advanced technical configuration including integrated FPGA DSP processing and a CT7601PR audio bridge controller. However, the design is fundamentally based on combining existing ICs with limited proprietary technology development. While the implementation of 6 filter functions and balanced output is commendable, it lacks more innovative approaches like the dual DAC configuration found in the iBasso DC04 Pro. It meets industry-standard technical levels but contains no technological breakthroughs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

In comparison with competing products offering equivalent functionality and measurement performance, the PD5 demonstrates excellent cost-performance. The higher-performing iBasso DC04 Pro (119 USD) features dual CS43131 DACs, 280mW@32Ω output, and 0.00013% THD+N, surpassing the PD5's measurements but at a higher price. The more affordable Tempotec Sonata HD Pro (approx. 39 USD) lacks a 4.4mm balanced output and has inferior output power of around 60mW@32Ω. The Apple USB-C dongle (9 USD) offers excellent measurement performance but suffers from low output power and lacks a balanced output. Among products meeting all functionality and measurement requirements of 3.5mm/4.4mm dual outputs, 255mW@32Ω driving power, 768kHz/DSD512 support, 125dB SNR, and -115dB THD+N, the PD5 is effectively the most affordable option available.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Akliam is an emerging audio manufacturer gaining attention recently, with an official AliExpress store and a wide product lineup ranging from desktop DACs and amplifiers to portable devices. Previous models like the PD4 Plus and PD3 have received positive evaluations, confirming a continuous product development structure. However, due to its short history, long-term failure rates and RMA response records remain unclear. Information regarding warranty periods and repair systems is limited, and a comprehensive support system like those of major manufacturers cannot be expected. While initial defect rates are reported to be low, long-term reliability over several years remains unknown. It represents an average support level for an emerging manufacturer.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The PD5's design philosophy aims for scientific sound quality improvement and is fundamentally rational. The combination of the AK4493SEQ DAC and RT6863 operational amplifiers directly contributes to measurement performance improvements, and the balanced output implementation is practical. The design approach based on measurement data, emphasizing the achievement of transparency-level measurements like -115dB THD+N and 125dB SNR, is commendable. However, the practical utility of the 6 filter functions is questionable. Additionally, since the combination of a smartphone, which most users already own, and an Apple dongle (9 USD) can also provide high-quality music playback, the value proposition of this dedicated device is somewhat limited for users who do not require balanced output or high power.

## Advice

The Akliam PD5 is suitable for users requiring a 4.4mm balanced output and 255mW@32Ω of driving power. Achieving transparency-level measurement performance with 125dB SNR and -115dB THD+N for 68 USD is noteworthy, capable of fully utilizing medium-impedance headphones and balanced-drive compatible earphones. However, users seeking higher measurement performance should consider investing in the iBasso DC04 Pro (119 USD, 0.00013% THD+N). For those not requiring a 4.4mm balanced output, more affordable options like the Tempotec Sonata HD Pro (approx. 39 USD) may suffice. While concerns remain regarding Akliam's support as an emerging manufacturer, it currently represents one of the most affordable options with equivalent functionality and measurement performance.
