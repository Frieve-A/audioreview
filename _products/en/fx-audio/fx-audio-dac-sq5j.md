## Overview

The fx-audio DAC-SQ5J is a compact desktop DAC featuring the high-performance "PCM1794A" DAC chip from Texas Instruments. Based on the company's popular model, it incorporates the next-generation USB receiver chip "SAVITECH BRAVO-HD SA9123L" supporting PCM audio up to 24bit/192kHz. It features three digital inputs (USB, optical digital, and coaxial digital) with analog RCA outputs in a compact chassis. Positioned as an entry to mid-range DAC product from the Chinese fx-audio brand.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

According to published specifications, the S/N ratio of 109dB and dynamic range of 110dB exceed the transparent level (105dB or higher), while the total harmonic distortion of 0.004% or less significantly clears the transparent standard (0.01% or less). Based on the theoretical performance of the PCM1794A chip, audible improvements can be expected in the 20Hz-20kHz range with proper implementation. However, detailed verification with third-party measurement data is limited, so the evaluation considers the risk of discrepancy between published values and actual performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The combination of PCM1794A and SAVITECH SA9123L represents solid design but lacks special uniqueness. The PCM1794A is a proven DAC chip that delivers good performance with proper circuit implementation. The USB receiver section also adopts standard solutions and can be expected to operate stably. However, compared to the latest ESS Sabre or AKM series chips, technological advancement is limited. This represents industry-average level technical implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The current price of the DAC-SQ5J is 100 USD. As the lowest-cost alternative with equivalent or superior performance, the SMSL SU-1 (80 USD) provides superior DAC performance. Calculation: 80 USD รท 100 USD = 0.8. The DAC-SQ5J achieves competitive pricing in the same function/performance category, but alternatives like the SU-1 offer better value for pure DAC functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

fx-audio is a Chinese audio equipment brand, but the warranty period is short at 6 months, and domestic support infrastructure is limited. User reports of initial defects and failures are observed, indicating quality control challenges. Long-term reliability data is also insufficient, leaving concerns about post-purchase support. This represents below industry-average levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

This represents a rational approach focused on improving measurement performance directly linked to sound quality improvement. The selection of PCM1794A is a sound judgment prioritizing audio quality, actually achieving excellent measurement results. The design philosophy emphasizing practicality through three digital inputs, simple operation, and compact design is commendable. The focus on pursuing basic performance without relying on unscientific claims or excessive additional features is highly rational.

## Advice

The fx-audio DAC-SQ5J is an excellent product in both measurement performance and cost-performance aspects. The ability to benefit from the high-performance PCM1794A at 100 USD is attractive. However, careful judgment is needed for long-term use due to the short warranty period and limited support infrastructure. Given quality control concerns, always verify retailer warranty terms and initial defect response when purchasing. For those seeking greater peace of mind or better value, alternatives like SMSL SU-1 (pure DAC with superior performance) or established brands like Topping and SMSL products are also viable.
