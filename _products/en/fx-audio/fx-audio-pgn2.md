## Overview

The fx-audio PGN2 is a compact USB stabilizer with USB power line noise filtering functionality. Marketed as an "industry's most affordable class Hi-Res compatible USB noise filter mechanism equipped USB stabilizer," it supports both USB bus power and self-power, features powerful power noise filtering, and includes dedicated common mode filters for USB signal lines. The compact 27×66×85mm housing is equipped with USB 1.1/2.0 compatible B-type (female) input and A-type (female) output. Positioned as a low-cost USB noise countermeasure product from the Chinese fx-audio brand.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No standardized third-party measurements or quantitative verification data versus transparency thresholds (e.g., THD+N, S/N, frequency response, jitter) were found. Per policy, when measurement performance is unknown, we start from 0.5. As with many USB power/signal accessories, effectiveness is highly environment-dependent; without quantitative evidence, we neither add nor subtract points.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This is a standard design combining USB power-line filtering with common-mode filters on signal lines. Features like GND coupling/separation jumpers show some consideration, but overall it is a combination of existing technologies with limited uniqueness compared to more advanced USB isolators.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Assumed PGN2 price: 28 USD. As a comparator with equivalent or better functionality, we select the iFi iSilencer+ (approximately 36 USD equivalent). Calculation: 28 USD ÷ 36 USD = 0.78 → 0.8. This confirms competitive pricing within the USB noise filter category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

fx-audio is a Chinese audio equipment brand; warranty/support tends to be short-term. Long-term reliability disclosures are limited, and domestic support frameworks are modest.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The basic concept—reducing noise on USB power/signal lines—is rational. A compact 27×66×85 mm chassis targeting USB 1.1/2.0 with combined power-line filtering and common-mode filters on signal lines is industry-standard. In power accessories, balancing voltage stability and noise reduction is critical; overall effectiveness depends on that balance.

## Advice

The fx-audio PGN2 provides USB noise filtering at a low price point. It is easy to introduce for PC audio noise countermeasures, and basic features such as bus/self power support and signal-line common-mode filters are present. Note the lack of quantitative measurement evidence; we recommend confirming suitability in your own environment. The effectiveness is likely only when USB power noise is a significant root cause in your setup. If you prioritize price-performance, consider alternatives with equivalent functionality (e.g., iFi iSilencer+) and compare price against claimed capabilities.
