## Overview

The Revel Concerta2 M16 is a 2-way bookshelf loudspeaker featuring a 6.5" deep anodized aluminum cone woofer and 1" aluminum dome tweeter with fourth-generation Acoustic Lens Waveguide technology. Derived from Revel's higher-end Performa3 Series design, the M16 incorporates computer-optimized driver positioning and a nine-element, high-order crossover network operating at 2.1 kHz. The bass-reflex enclosure utilizes a rear-firing port design, with nominal impedance of 6 ohms and sensitivity rated at 86 dB (2.83V @ 1M). Frequency response extends from 55 Hz (-3 dB) to 40 kHz, with recommended amplifier power of 50-120W. Founded in 1995 as part of Harman International, Revel has established itself through scientific measurement-based speaker development using advanced anechoic chamber testing and double-blind listening validation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The M16 demonstrates measured performance that significantly exceeds problematic levels and approaches transparent levels in key areas. Third-party measurements from Audio Science Review using Klippel Near-field Scanner with over 1000 data points confirm "well behaved soundfield" characteristics with less than 1% error across the frequency range [1]. The spinorama measurements reveal slight bass boost around 100Hz with high frequency roll-off above 10kHz, while distortion analysis shows rising distortion before the 2.1kHz crossover point where woofer breakup occurs [1]. Audioholics measurements show "impressively flat" frequency response with measured sensitivity of 85.5 dB closely matching the 86 dB specification, and excellent horizontal dispersion up to 50 degrees off-axis [2]. The impedance characteristics show 6Ω nominal with low-impedance valley centered around 150Hz and steep phase changes at high impedance levels [2]. Frequency response linearity within ±3dB tolerance and superior directivity control place the M16 in the transparent level borderline range for speakers in this category.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The M16 incorporates Revel's proprietary fourth-generation Acoustic Lens Waveguide technology, representing significant technical advancement derived from their higher-end Performa3 Series. The implementation demonstrates sophisticated engineering with computer-optimized driver positioning and advanced nine-element, high-order crossover network design [1]. Revel's measurement capabilities include anechoic chambers with 0.5dB accuracy down to 20Hz, representing Academy-recognized industry-leading technical expertise that directly contributes to product development [3]. The design ownership remains in-house through Harman International, with high accumulation of technical know-how spanning multiple generations of Acoustic Lens development. The technology integration demonstrates appropriate combination of mechanical precision and acoustic optimization, resulting in measurably superior dispersion characteristics compared to conventional designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Current market price for the M16 is 900 USD. This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The Polk Audio Signature Elite ES20 at 257 USD features a 6.5-inch woofer and provides frequency response of 41Hz-40kHz (±3dB) compared to M16's 55Hz-40kHz (-3dB) [4]. Audio Science Review measurements confirm ES20 achieves 41Hz-40kHz ±3dB response, showing superior bass extension (41Hz vs 55Hz) and equivalent high-frequency performance (40kHz) [4]. Both speakers are measured at 86dB levels, indicating comparable sensitivity specifications. While impedance differs (Polk ES20: 8Ω nominal vs M16: 6Ω nominal), both accommodate standard amplifier outputs with similar power requirements and present no practical compatibility differences for users. Both speakers achieve frequency response linearity within ±3dB tolerance and comparable sensitivity specifications, representing equivalent user-facing functionality and measured characteristics. CP = 257 USD ÷ 900 USD = 0.29, rounded to 0.3.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Revel offers five-year warranty coverage, significantly exceeding the industry standard two-year warranty period [5]. Support infrastructure operates through Harman International's global network with dedicated service partners throughout the US and Canada. The company maintains strict authorized dealer policies, honoring warranties only for products purchased through authorized channels with proper documentation [6]. Construction quality demonstrates solid engineering with robust build design resistant to typical degradation factors. Harman International's established track record in both professional and consumer audio markets provides confidence in long-term support capabilities. The service network utilizes trained professionals specifically experienced with Revel products, ensuring appropriate technical expertise for repair and maintenance needs.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Revel demonstrates exemplary rationality through their measurement-focused scientific approach to loudspeaker development. The company's methodology emphasizes anechoic chamber testing, double-blind listening validation, and objective performance optimization, completely eliminating subjective design elements in favor of measurable improvements [3]. R&D investment directly contributes to function and measurement performance through advanced testing facilities recognized by the Academy of High End Audio & Video. The design philosophy shows continuous refinement across multiple generations with objective measurement validation, ensuring performance progression in new models. Proprietary Acoustic Lens technology and computer optimization contribute directly to measured dispersion performance rather than pursuing aesthetically-driven or subjectively-based design approaches. The scientific testing methodology represents an innovative approach that prioritizes audible performance improvements over marketing-driven features or traditional audio industry conventions.

## Advice

The Revel M16 represents scientifically validated engineering excellence with measured performance approaching transparent levels in key characteristics. The sophisticated Acoustic Lens Waveguide technology and computer-optimized design deliver demonstrably superior dispersion control compared to conventional approaches. However, potential purchasers must carefully consider the cost-performance implications, as equally-or-better measured performance alternatives exist at significantly lower price points. The Polk Audio Signature Elite ES20 provides equivalent-or-better measured performance (41Hz-40kHz vs 55Hz-40kHz, superior bass extension) and functionality at approximately one-third the cost. The M16 becomes most justified for buyers who specifically value Revel's brand heritage and engineering reputation, or those integrating within existing Revel systems where aesthetic and sonic consistency outweighs pure cost considerations. For budget-conscious purchasers prioritizing measured performance per dollar spent, the comparison alternative delivers equivalent-or-better results with substantial cost savings that could fund additional system components or room treatment improvements.
