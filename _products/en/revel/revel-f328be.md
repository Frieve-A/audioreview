## Overview

The Revel F328Be represents the flagship floorstanding loudspeaker from Harman's award-winning PerformaBe series. This 3-way triple 8-inch floorstanding design features a 1-inch beryllium dome tweeter with 85mm dual ceramic magnets, 5.25-inch midrange driver with Deep Ceramic Composite (DCC) aluminum cone, and three 8-inch woofers utilizing the same DCC technology. Technical specifications include frequency response of 26Hz-40kHz (-6dB), sensitivity of 91dB, nominal impedance of 8 ohms, and crossover frequencies at 240Hz and 2.1kHz. The speaker incorporates Revel's 6th-generation Acoustic Lens waveguide technology and high-order crossover networks with film capacitors and air core inductors. Current retail price is 19,600 USD per pair.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The F328Be demonstrates excellent measured performance across multiple acoustic indicators. Independent measurements from Audio Science Review show frequency response deviation of ±2.8dB from 80Hz to 20kHz [1], which surpasses the problematic level threshold of ±3.0dB for speakers and approaches the excellent level of ±1dB. Bass distortion performance is exceptional, staying well below distortion limits even at high volumes of 96dB SPL. Sensitivity measures 91.3dB (2.83V/1m), exceeding typical requirements for efficient amplifier coupling. Deep bass extension reaches 26Hz (-6dB) with port tuning at 30Hz, providing superior low-frequency capability compared to most competitors. The combination of flat frequency response, low distortion, high sensitivity, and extended bass response places this product well above transparent performance levels across all relevant acoustic metrics.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The F328Be showcases world-class proprietary technology implementation. The beryllium dome tweeter incorporates massive 85mm dual ceramic magnets with vented pole piece and distortion reduction ring, representing advanced materials science applied to acoustic engineering. Revel's 6th-generation Acoustic Lens waveguide features increased footprint and smoother transition sections, virtually eliminating edge diffraction found in previous generations. The Deep Ceramic Composite (DCC) cone technology uses plasma electrolytic oxidation process to create ceramic coating on aluminum substrates, providing superior stiffness-to-weight ratio. High-order crossover design utilizes film capacitors and air core inductors in midrange and tweeter circuits for minimal signal degradation. These patented technologies require extensive manufacturing expertise and represent innovations that competitors actively seek to replicate, demonstrating significant competitive advantage duration and technical sophistication.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. At 19,600 USD per pair, comprehensive market analysis failed to identify any equivalent-or-better alternatives at lower pricing. Products with similar beryllium tweeter technology, comparable frequency response deviation (±2.8dB from 80Hz-20kHz), equivalent sensitivity (91.3dB measured), and similar bass extension (26Hz -6dB) require similar investment levels. The F328Be represents the world's cheapest option among speakers achieving this combination of measured acoustic performance, driver technology, and user-facing functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The F328Be benefits from robust construction utilizing high-quality materials and manufacturing processes. The beryllium tweeter design is inherently resistant to degradation under normal operating conditions, though special handling protocols are provided for the unlikely event of damage. Harman International provides global support infrastructure through authorized dealer networks with comprehensive warranty coverage. The company maintains an established track record in high-end audio with consistent product quality across product lines. Professional manufacturer support systems ensure proper service availability. The simple passive speaker design with minimal moving parts contributes to long-term reliability expectations. Clear safety documentation addresses beryllium-specific considerations, demonstrating responsible engineering practices.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Revel demonstrates exemplary measurement-focused scientific approach to loudspeaker development. Founded with the explicit goal of creating "the world's finest loudspeakers" through rigorous scientific methodology, the company employs comprehensive anechoic chamber measurements, double-blind listening tests, and 70+ automated measurement protocols for complete performance characterization. Products reach production only after blind listening panel validation, eliminating subjective bias. The 6th-generation waveguide represents continuous technological advancement with measurable improvements over previous generations. Cost allocation focuses entirely on performance-relevant technologies: beryllium tweeter materials, DCC cone technology, and precision crossover components all contribute directly to measured acoustic improvements. The design philosophy completely eliminates occult audio approaches, prioritizing objective measurement results over subjective claims. This rational, research-driven development process consistently produces products with superior measured performance.

## Advice

The F328Be represents excellent floorstanding loudspeaker technology with measured performance justifying its position among high-end speakers. Recommended for users requiring premium acoustic performance and appreciating advanced waveguide technology, particularly those with high-current amplifiers capable of driving 8-ohm loads efficiently. The beryllium tweeter requires careful handling but provides excellent high-frequency performance when properly maintained. Room treatment considerations apply due to extended bass response and high output capability. At current pricing, the F328Be represents the most cost-effective path to this level of measured acoustic performance, combining beryllium tweeter technology, advanced waveguide design, and comprehensive bass extension. The investment delivers unique technology implementation not available at lower price points.
