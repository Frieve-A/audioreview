## Overview

The Letshuoer DZ4 is an in-ear monitor featuring a configuration of three 6mm titanium dome dynamic drivers plus one R-Sonic passive filtering module. Official store listing shows a regular price of 88 USD with periodic discounts (review uses regular price for evaluation) [1]. The DZ4 employs a four-way acoustic tube design with a two-way crossover. The chassis combines a 3D-printed resin shell and a CNC-milled anodized aluminum faceplate; the stock cable is a 4-core silver-plated copper cable with 0.78mm dual-pin connectors [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Available independent frequency-response data confirms DZ4’s tuning deviates from strict neutrality, with a sub-bass lift and non-flat upper-mids/treble relative to common references [2]. Manufacturer-facing specifications such as published bandwidth (20Hz–40kHz) exist, but independent distortion and other lab data (THD/IMD/SNR) are not provided by reputable labs as of the review date. In short, there is measurable data for FR yet no evidence of exceptional transparency across broader metrics. The triple-DD plus passive module configuration does not show clear measurement advantages versus good single-DD sets at lower prices.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The DZ4 incorporates a multi-driver dynamic array plus a passive filtering module and four-way acoustic tubing, which is an above-average design effort for the segment. Materials (CNC-milled anodized aluminum faceplate, 3D-printed resin shell, silver-plated copper cable) are appropriate [1]. However, without independent evidence of lowered distortion or superior FR linearity over simpler designs, the technology appears more ambitious than outcome-effective.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Using the regular official price (88 USD) as the review basis [1] and the cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator observed in the US market, 7Hz Salnotes Zero at 20.69 USD [5], cost-performance is low. CP = 20.69 USD ÷ 88 USD ≈ 0.24, rounded to 0.3. For reference, Moondrop Chu II is 22.99 USD [3]. Given comparable or better measured FR and widely validated performance for these alternatives, DZ4’s multi-driver complexity does not translate into a better value.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Letshuoer provides a standard 1-year warranty and global sales channels [1]. The detachable 0.78mm 2-pin cable aids serviceability. The resin/aluminum construction suggests adequate durability for typical use. Complexity of the internal array may add potential failure points versus simpler single-DD designs. As a passive analog product, no firmware considerations apply.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

There is a rational attempt to achieve broad-band output and tuning flexibility via multi-DD plus passive filtering. Yet, absent corroborating third-party measurements demonstrating audibly superior transparency (e.g., lower THD, flatter FR), complexity appears to exceed realized benefits. Prioritizing measurable outcomes over driver count would likely yield better efficiency and value.

## Advice

Hard to recommend at its regular price given cheaper peers with strong measurements. Consider Moondrop Chu II (22.99 USD) for neutral-leaning tuning or 7Hz Salnotes Zero (22.99 USD) for a bright, detailed tilt [3][4]. DZ4’s distinctive construction may appeal aesthetically, but evidence does not show acoustic advantages commensurate with price.
