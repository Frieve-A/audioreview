price: 330
summary: "Premium-feeling mid-tier planar with clever acoustic touches and great accessories; measured transparency and value don’t justify the 330 USD reference."

## Overview

The LETSHUOER S15 is a third-generation planar-magnetic in-ear monitor using a 14.8 mm planar driver plus a 6 mm **R-Sonic** passive filtering module. The shell combines an aluminum-magnesium faceplate with a 3D-printed resin body, and the stock cable includes 2.5/3.5/4.4 mm swappable plugs. Reference price is **330 USD**.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

- **What’s measured:** Independent **frequency-response** (IEC-711–type) data are available and show a warm, relaxed tuning versus neutral targets. Manufacturer specs: 30 Ω, 106 dB. [1][2][3]  
- **What isn’t:** We could not locate credible third-party **THD** datasets for S15. Claims of “high resolution” therefore remain subjective.  
**Verdict:** Some FR coverage exists, but the evidence is insufficient to claim strong scientific transparency beyond a mid score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

- 14.8 mm planar with dual-chamber structure and a **6 mm R-Sonic** passive module shaping pressure/bass behavior. [1]  
- **HeyGears** 3D-printed shell; modular cable with 2.5/3.5/4.4 mm plugs included. [1][2]  
Incremental, well-executed engineering rather than a breakthrough.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**Baseline:** S15 at **330 USD**. [1]  
**Cheapest equal-or-better alternative (measured):** **Etymotic ER2SE** — well-documented **35–42 dB isolation** and **flat/DF-aligned FR**, widely sold at **99.95 USD**. [4][5]  
- **Why it qualifies:** ER2SE’s target adherence and isolation are objectively stronger than S15’s third-party FR shows; both are measurable performance axes. [3][4]  
- **CP result:** 99.95 ÷ 330 = **0.30** → **0.3**.  
Note: If you specifically want planar dynamics and a thinner profile, **7Hz Timeless II** is **229 USD** and commonly quoted **THD < 0.2% @ 1 kHz**, still under S15’s price but not as neutrally measured as ER2SE. [6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Warranty:** 1-year on IEMs / 3-month on cable from LETSHUOER; typical for the segment. [7] Documentation and contact channels are adequate.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Coherent goal of easy-listening warmth, comfort, and rich accessories. It doesn’t prioritize strict neutrality/measurement-first design, so we keep this at 0.4.

## Advice

**Buy if** you want a premium-feeling planar set with modular plugs and relaxed tuning.  
**Skip if** you prioritize **measured neutrality/value**—ER2SE (and similar well-measured dynamics) are objectively better buys.
