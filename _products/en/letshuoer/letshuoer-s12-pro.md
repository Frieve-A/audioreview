summary: "Planar magnetic IEM with modular cable and solid build; third-party measurements exist, but cheaper IEMs with equal or better measured performance undercut it on value."

## Overview

The Letshuoer S12 Pro iterates on the original S12 with a custom 14.8 mm planar magnetic driver in a 5-axis CNC-milled aluminum shell and a modular cable with swappable 2.5 / 3.5 / 4.4 mm plugs. It targets listeners who want a robust wired IEM with “planar” timbre and convenient terminations in the sub-200 USD bracket. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent measurements are available. Headphonesty provides an IEC-711 frequency response (FR) of the S12 Pro showing a balanced V-shape with a known ~8 kHz coupler artifact called out; overall behavior is consistent with community databases. [3][4] Reference Audio Analyzer (RAA) reports measured sensitivity at **123.56 dB/V** (≈ 109.35 dB/mW) and documents impedance behavior, confirming easy drivability even if nominal impedance differs from spec. [5] Public THD data specific to S12 Pro are limited from the sources consulted, so we start from the 0.5 baseline for “measured but not demonstrably transparent,” and hold at **0.5** given credible FR/sensitivity coverage without comprehensive distortion verification. [3][5]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A large-format planar driver in a compact IEM, precise 5-axis CNC housing, and a stock modular plug system are competent, modern choices. They’re well-executed rather than novel; there is no new acoustic topology or DSP advance here. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better available):** *TRUTHEAR x Crinacle ZERO: RED* at **USD 64.99** (widely available retail). Measured performance is at least comparable: Rtings reports **outstanding harmonic distortion performance** with FR alignment close to target, and it is a conventional wired IEM like the S12 Pro. [6][7] Using the S12 Pro’s representative market price **USD 169** as the denominator, the Cost-Performance score is **0.4**.

*(Equivalence basis – short): Both are wired, passive IEMs; ZERO: RED’s third-party FR adherence and very low harmonic distortion meet or exceed S12 Pro’s publicly documented metrics for transparency-relevant behavior. [3][4][5][7]*

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Letshuoer states **12-month** warranty for earphone units and **3-month** for cables—typical for the category. The all-metal shell and simple passive design bode well, but brand-wide long-term failure data remain limited. Average overall. [2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design choices (planar driver, solid metal shell, modular terminations) address real usability needs and don’t rely on pseudo-scientific claims. However, given that equal-or-better measured performance is obtainable markedly cheaper, allocating budget to cable and machining over documented acoustic gains slightly weakens the value-oriented rationale.

## Advice

Buy S12 Pro if you specifically value its planar timbre, metal build, and included modular terminations. If your goal is **measurement-driven fidelity per dollar**, consider TRUTHEAR ZERO: RED (or similar) first; you give up the aluminum shell and modular stock cable but retain excellent measured performance for much less. [6][7]
