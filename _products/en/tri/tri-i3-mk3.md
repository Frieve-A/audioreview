summary: "A multi-driver IEM with a tribrid configuration. The division of roles for each driver is rational, but scientific validity is unknown due to undisclosed measurement data. Cost-performance is exceedingly low as cheaper alternatives offer a comparable listening experience."

## Overview

The TRI i3 MK3 is the third-generation earphone in the company's popular i3 series. It employs a tribrid configuration combining a 10mm beryllium-coated dynamic driver (lows), a Sonion 2356 balanced armature (mids), and a 10mm planar magnetic driver (highs). It features a CNC aluminum alloy housing paired with a silver-plated cable and a standard 4.4mm balanced plug. Specifications include an impedance of 21Ω, sensitivity of 104±1dB, and a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz. Released in June 2024, its current price is 200 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product receives a low rating in terms of measured performance. While the 21Ω impedance and 104±1dB sensitivity make it easy to drive, there is a complete lack of specific measurement data such as THD, SNR, crosstalk, and dynamic range, which are essential for a scientific evaluation. The separation of frequency bands by the tribrid configuration is only supported by subjective user reviews, with no evidence of achieving transparency levels through objective measurements. The frequency response is listed as 20Hz-20kHz, but details like deviation (±dB) are missing, making the data insufficient for assessing scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Hybrid technology combining multiple driver types is a well-established approach in today's IEM market. The beryllium-coated diaphragm, Sonion BA driver, and planar driver are all proven components, but the design of combining them is not particularly novel. The use of a CNC-machined housing and high-quality cable is commendable, but the technological uniqueness and innovation are limited. The component selection is above the industry average, but it does not reach top-tier innovation, hence a score of 0.6.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The price of 200 USD is evaluated by comparing it to alternatives that provide a comparable or superior high-fidelity listening experience. A key competitor is the "Truthear x Crinacle ZERO:RED" (street price 56 USD), which is highly acclaimed for its scientific tuning. Although the driver configuration differs, the essential value delivered to the user—a high-fidelity music experience—is equivalent or better. The cost-performance is calculated as `56 USD ÷ 200 USD ≈ 0.28`, which rounds to 0.3. The price of the i3 MK3 is exceedingly high for its performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

TRI is a relatively new audio brand, and objective long-term reliability data is limited. There is less clarity and assurance regarding warranty periods and domestic repair systems compared to major brands. While a certain level of quality control is assumed for a Chinese brand, the comprehensiveness of after-sales service is reasonably assessed as being at the industry average. As this product category does not require firmware updates, the evaluation depends entirely on the handling of physical failures.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design approach is scientifically rational. By assigning specialized drivers to each frequency band, the design theoretically aims to minimize distortion in each band and improve overall resolution. The adoption of beryllium and planar drivers is a rational choice that contributes to improved responsiveness and high-frequency characteristics. However, since measurement data is not disclosed, it is unclear whether challenges associated with this approach, such as crossover design optimization and phase coherence, have been resolved. The philosophy itself is rational, but its implementation cannot be verified.

## Advice

The TRI i3 MK3 is technically characterized by its inclusion of three driver types: beryllium, BA, and planar. However, whether its acoustic performance justifies the price is questionable. Scientific measurement data is not publicly available, leaving its objective sonic advantages unproven. Furthermore, with products like the "Truthear x Crinacle ZERO:RED" available for around 57 USD offering a comparable or better listening experience, the cost-performance of the i3 MK3 is extremely poor. We cannot recommend this product to anyone other than audiophiles with a specific attachment to its driver configuration or design. We strongly advise considering more affordable products with high objective performance evaluations.
