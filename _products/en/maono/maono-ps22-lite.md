## Overview

The MAONO PS22 Lite is a 2-channel USB audio interface designed for content creators and home studio applications. Priced at 69.99 USD, it offers 24-bit/192kHz recording capability through USB-C connectivity. The interface features XLR/TRS combo and instrument inputs, +48V phantom power, and up to 56dB of microphone preamp gain. MAONO targets the growing internet audio market with software integration through their Routing Center application, providing virtual channels and loopback functionality for streaming and content creation workflows.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The PS22 Lite achieves a 106dB dynamic range, just meeting the transparent level criteria of 105dB or above according to measurement standards. The 24-bit/192kHz recording capability exceeds basic requirements for audio transparency. However, user reports indicate "slight preamp hiss when gain is cranked too high" and "white noise in headphone output as volume increases," suggesting practical audio quality limitations. Critical specifications including S/N ratio, THD+N, frequency response, and crosstalk measurements are not publicly available, limiting comprehensive evaluation. Without third-party measurements and relying on manufacturer specifications, conservative evaluation guidelines require adjusting the score toward 0.5, resulting in borderline transparent level performance with documented quality issues.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The PS22 Lite incorporates contemporary technology standards including USB-C connectivity and comprehensive software integration through the Routing Center application. The software provides virtual channels, loopback functionality, and ASIO driver support for low-latency performance. Multi-platform compatibility spans Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and ChromeOS. However, the implementation appears to follow standard OEM/ODM practices without significant proprietary innovation or patent technology. The hardware design represents typical industry approaches with no evidence of advanced technical differentiation or competitive advantages that would require extended periods for competitors to replicate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Among products with equivalent or better user-facing functions and measured performance, the PS22 Lite represents the most affordable option in the 24-bit/192kHz audio interface segment. Comparison analysis reveals that the Behringer U-Phoria UM2 (30 USD) and M-Audio M-Track Solo (49 USD) offer inferior 16-bit/48kHz specifications. The Focusrite Scarlett Solo 4th Gen (149.99 USD) provides equivalent 24-bit/192kHz capability but costs significantly more. The PreSonus AudioBox USB 96 (94.99 USD) offers only 24-bit/96kHz, making it functionally inferior. Equipped with equivalent recording resolution, phantom power, and multi-platform compatibility, no cheaper alternative exists that matches the PS22 Lite's specifications. CP = No cheaper equivalent exists = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

MAONO provides above-average warranty coverage with 12-month warranty and 365-day replacement policy, exceeding typical 1-year basic coverage. The company offers 24/7 customer support with professional debugging assistance and comprehensive software compatibility guides for major DAWs. The metal construction is described as "tough, industrial design that feels sturdy and substantial," suggesting durability advantages. However, user reports document audio quality limitations including preamp hiss at higher gain settings, headphone output noise at increased volumes, and marginal gain sufficiency for dynamic microphones. These practical limitations may affect long-term user satisfaction despite strong support infrastructure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

MAONO demonstrates rational design philosophy focused on contemporary content creation requirements. The company's emphasis on "internet audio products" aligns with current market demands, incorporating advanced software-hardware integration through the Routing Center application. Virtual channels and loopback functionality directly address content creator workflows without meaningless premium materials or components. The multi-platform compatibility approach and ASIO driver implementation support professional workflows. MAONO's mission to create products for "fast-growing young generations who podcast and share on the internet" represents appropriate market positioning. However, the approach lacks significant innovation beyond standard industry practices, following conventional engineering without breakthrough technological advancement.

## Advice

The MAONO PS22 Lite offers exceptional value for users requiring 24-bit/192kHz recording capability at the lowest available price point. Content creators and podcasters will benefit from the comprehensive software integration and multi-platform compatibility. However, users planning to operate at higher gain settings or requiring pristine audio quality should consider the reported preamp hiss and headphone output noise limitations. Dynamic microphone users may need to supplement with external gain boosters like Cloudlifters. For condenser microphone recording and basic content creation workflows at moderate gain levels, the PS22 Lite provides unmatched cost-performance in its specification class.
