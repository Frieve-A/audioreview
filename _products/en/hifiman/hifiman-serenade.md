## Overview

The HiFiMan Serenade is an all-in-one desktop DAC/amplifier developed in collaboration with GoldenWave. It combines the proprietary Himalaya PRO R2R DAC with a Class A headphone amplifier and includes network streaming functionality. The unit features a substantial 3.9kg toroidal transformer and supports high-resolution audio up to DSD512 and PCM 32bit/768kHz. Priced at 1,149 USD, it positions itself in the premium desktop audio market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measurement performance of this unit, featuring the Himalaya PRO R2R DAC, is excellent. Its THD is 0.0025%, which is significantly below the transparent level (under 0.01%), and the SNR is 110dB, exceeding the transparent level (105dB or higher). The channel separation is also outstanding at -120dB, far surpassing the transparent level (-70dB or lower). The frequency response is nearly perfectly flat at ±0.1dB from 20Hz-20kHz. The Class A amplifier delivers a powerful 4W into a 32Ω load, capable of driving most headphones with ease. All major measurement parameters meet or significantly exceed transparent levels, resulting in a very high scientific validity rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The custom-developed Himalaya PRO R2R DAC utilizes 0.01% precision resistors and a new FPGA algorithm, designed to surpass the performance of the legendary PCM1704 chip. The Class A amplification circuit features a precisely matched, fully discrete configuration to achieve superior acoustic characteristics. The robust power supply, with its 3.9kg oxygen-free copper toroidal transformer and approximately 30,000μF of filter capacitance, is a rational, performance-oriented design choice. Modern technical elements, such as the XMOS XU316 USB chip and built-in Wi-Fi for network streaming, are also appropriately integrated.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The cost-performance of the HiFiMan Serenade (1,149 USD) is evaluated by comparing it to an alternative that offers equivalent or better core performance. The Serenade's built-in network streaming can be considered replaceable by a PC via a USB connection. From this perspective, the Topping DX7 Pro+ (699 USD) serves as a valid comparison, as it boasts equivalent or higher output power (4.2W@32Ω) and exceptionally high measurement performance. The calculation is "699 USD ÷ 1,149 USD = 0.608," which results in a score of 0.6. For a typical desktop setup using a PC as the source, equivalent or better performance can be achieved for significantly less money, making its cost-performance slightly above average.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

HiFiMan has established a presence in global markets through authorized distributors and has a sales track record on major e-commerce platforms. The product comes with a standard warranty. However, as a relatively new audio manufacturer, it lacks the long-term reliability data of more established brands. The quality control from the collaboration with GoldenWave is a promising factor. The heavy 3.9kg chassis and toroidal transformer suggest good physical durability. Overall, industry-average reliability and support can be expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The adoption of proprietary R2R DAC technology is a rational choice, aiming for high performance through an approach different from common delta-sigma modulators. Prioritizing sound quality over efficiency with a Class A amplification circuit and a powerful linear power supply is also rational, as it serves the clear purpose of improving audio quality. The comprehensive set of inputs, including USB, optical, coaxial, and network, suits modern and diverse use cases. As a dedicated audio device, it is designed with a scientific approach based on measured performance, and its design philosophy is highly commendable.

## Advice

The HiFiMan Serenade is a technically excellent product that consolidates attractive features like an R2R DAC, a Class A amplifier, and network functionality into a single chassis. However, its cost-performance should be carefully considered before purchase. If you find significant value in the standalone streaming capabilities and the specific sonic characteristics of an R2R DAC and Class A amp, the 1,149 USD price may be justified. On the other hand, if your primary use is a desktop audio setup connected to a PC and you prioritize pure measurement performance and driving power, you can achieve equivalent or better results with the more affordable Topping DX7 Pro+ (699 USD).
