## Overview

The HiFiMan HE400se represents the company's entry-level planar magnetic headphones, incorporating Stealth Magnet technology derived from flagship models [1]. Released in 2020-2021 with the Stealth Magnets version in 2022, these open-back headphones utilize an 80mm planar magnetic driver with ferrite magnets rather than neodymium for cost reduction. HiFiMan, founded by Dr. Fang Bian in 2005, operates dedicated R&D centers and maintains in-house manufacturing in China. The HE400se positions itself at 109 USD as part of HiFiMan's strategy to democratize planar magnetic technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The HE400se demonstrates favorable measurement performance with verified third-party data from Audio Science Review, DIY-Audio-Heaven, Reference Audio Analyzer, and SoundStage Network [2][3][4]. Measured THD remains below 0.2%, approaching the excellent threshold of 0.05% for headphones [3]. Frequency response deviation of approximately ±2-3dB meets the standard threshold of ±3dB with compliance to target curves except for bass region and slight 1.5-3kHz shortfall [2]. These measurements place the HE400se near the transparent level borderline for its category.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

HiFiMan demonstrates moderate technology implementation through proprietary Stealth Magnet design and established planar magnetic expertise [1]. The company's in-house development capabilities span from 2009 HE-5 through current flagship models. Stealth Magnet technology with rounded edges reduces acoustic interference, though performance impact remains unclear versus marketing benefit. The 80mm driver utilizes standard planar magnetic principles with silver traces. Single-sided magnet array represents cost-reduction approach rather than technical advancement, limiting overall technology assessment despite genuine innovation elements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

CP = 1.0 (no cheaper equivalent-or-better product exists). No equivalent-or-better open-back headphones with verified third-party measurements exist at a lower price point than the HE400SE's 109 USD. Qualified comparisons include Sennheiser HD560S (180-200 USD) with THD 0.05% and sensitivity 99 dB/mW, and HiFiMAN Sundara (279 USD) with THD below 0.5% and sensitivity 90 dB/mW [5]. The HE400se achieves measured THD below 0.2% and sensitivity 86.6 dB/mW. This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

HiFiMan provides standard one-year warranty extendable to 18 months through product registration, with global support network availability through an extensive authorized dealer network [1]. The short warranty period represents a negative factor. While forum discussions mention cable and pad quality concerns, these are user-replaceable accessories rather than core product reliability issues. No statistical failure rate data (RMA ratio, MTBF) is publicly available for this specific model, so failure rate assessment remains neutral. Parts availability for repairs may be limited for older or discontinued models. The global manufacturer support infrastructure provides accessibility for warranty service.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

HiFiMan demonstrates exemplary rational design philosophy through technology democratization strategy [1]. Cost allocation prioritizes functional performance over aesthetic elements, utilizing mass production efficiency in Chinese facilities while maintaining in-house control. The approach focuses on scientifically-based planar magnetic technology with proprietary Stealth Magnet innovations rather than marketing-driven features. Clear model progression from HE400s shows measurable improvements in resolution and distortion. Manufacturing decisions favor ferrite magnets over neodymium for cost optimization without compromising core functionality. This represents optimal rational approach to accessible audiophile product development.

## Advice

The HE400se suits users seeking genuine planar magnetic technology at minimal cost with capability for third-party cable upgrades. Immediate stock cable replacement becomes essential due to documented quality issues. Users requiring reliable long-term operation should consider higher-tier alternatives given quality control patterns. The headphones require dedicated amplification despite efficiency claims. Buyers prioritizing measurements over brand prestige will find functional planar magnetic technology at unprecedented pricing. Consider extended warranty options and budget for immediate accessory upgrades when purchasing.
