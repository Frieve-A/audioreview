## Overview

The HiFiMan HE400se Non-Stealth represents the original version of HiFiMan's entry-level planar magnetic headphone line, featuring traditional magnet assembly rather than the company's newer Stealth Magnet technology. Launched as an affordable introduction to planar magnetic technology at 109 USD, this open-back headphone employs an 80mm planar magnetic driver with silver trace design. As part of HiFiMan's budget-conscious offerings, it targets users seeking planar magnetic performance without premium pricing, though it predates the acoustic improvements found in the stealth magnet iteration. Note that this non-stealth version has limited availability in US markets, being primarily sold through Asian retailers and specialized audio stores.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

To evaluate the scientific validity of the HE400se Non-Stealth, credible third-party measurement data specifically targeting the Non-Stealth version is required. However, investigation found no measurement data that clearly identifies the Non-Stealth version. Available measurement data targets the standard HE400se without explicit distinction between Stealth and Non-Stealth versions, so it is unclear whether the measurements specifically target the Non-Stealth version. Manufacturer specifications claim 32Ω impedance and 91dB SPL sensitivity, but independent third-party measurement data to verify actual measured performance is insufficient, limiting scientific validity assessment due to insufficient data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The HE400se Non-Stealth employs established planar magnetic technology with HiFiMan's in-house design expertise accumulated over years of development. The 80mm driver incorporates silver trace design and represents solid technical implementation within its price tier. HiFiMan's proprietary planar magnetic technology demonstrates technical sophistication that other manufacturers seek to emulate, contributing to the technology level score. However, this non-stealth version lacks the advanced magnet geometry found in newer iterations, representing mature rather than cutting-edge implementation. The technology is desirable within the industry and demonstrates accumulated know-how, but the purely analog/mechanical approach without digital integration limits advancement potential compared to contemporary designs incorporating DSP or smart features.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The HE400se Non-Stealth is priced at 109 USD, though availability is primarily through Asian markets and specialized retailers rather than mainstream US channels. Due to insufficient measurement data targeting the Non-Stealth version, comparison evaluation is based solely on manufacturer specifications. Through systematic evaluation of equivalent-or-better alternatives, the Samson SR850 was identified as the primary comparison target at 40 USD [5]. Equipped with semi-open design, detachable cable system, and over-ear configuration, the Samson SR850 provides frequency response (10Hz-30kHz) and sensitivity (98dB) specifications that are equivalent-or-better than the review target's manufacturer specifications (32Ω, 91dB SPL) in terms of functionality. CP = 40 USD ÷ 109 USD = 0.367, rounded to 0.4. This indicates that equivalent functionality can be obtained at approximately one-third the price through alternative products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Investigation reveals mixed reliability indicators for the HE400se Non-Stealth. HiFiMan provides a standard 1-year warranty with global manufacturer support infrastructure, including warranty registration that can extend coverage to 1.5 years. However, multiple sources document quality control concerns across HiFiMan's product line, including cable failures, headband adjustment issues, and driver problems [1][2]. The company has had to silently update cable designs due to kinking and durability issues, suggesting ongoing manufacturing challenges. While HiFiMan maintains customer service availability and repair channels, documented QC problems and the shorter-than-average warranty period compared to industry standards of 2+ years contribute to below-average reliability assessment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

HiFiMan's design philosophy demonstrates mixed rationality when evaluated against scientific principles. Dr. Fang Bian's approach starts with measurements to check for "nothing surprising" like high distortion, showing initial scientific awareness [3][4]. However, the philosophy subsequently emphasizes subjective "concert hall" experiences and listening sessions over measurement-based optimization. Claims about cable material effects on sound signature and the goal of reproducing specific acoustic environments like "row 10 to row 20 in Carnegie Hall" lack controlled scientific validation. The non-stealth version represents older magnet technology compared to the company's stealth magnet innovation, indicating incremental rather than rationalized technological progression. While the company demonstrates technical competence in planar magnetic implementation, the design philosophy relies on subjective concepts that cannot be empirically verified, limiting overall rationality.

## Advice

Consider the HE400se Non-Stealth primarily if you specifically seek entry-level planar magnetic technology at minimal cost and have realistic expectations about its limitations. Manufacturer specifications claim 91dB SPL sensitivity, but actual measurement data is insufficient, making it unclear whether smartphone or laptop use is practical for adequate volume levels. Dedicated amplifier use is recommended. As an open-back design, it provides no sound isolation and significant sound leakage, restricting use to quiet, private environments only.

Alternative considerations include the Samson SR850 at 40 USD, which offers equivalent functionality at approximately one-third the price. For those specifically interested in planar magnetic technology, saving toward HiFiMan's stealth magnet versions or competing planar magnetic offerings may provide better long-term value. The traditional magnet design of this non-stealth version represents older technology that has been superseded by more acoustically transparent implementations.

If you proceed with this model, budget for a quality headphone amplifier as an essential accessory, and understand that the non-stealth magnet assembly may introduce acoustic compromises compared to more advanced implementations available in the current market.
