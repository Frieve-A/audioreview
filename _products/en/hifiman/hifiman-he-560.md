## Overview

The HiFiMAN HE-560 is an open-back planar magnetic headphone that introduced single-sided magnet design to reduce weight while maintaining planar magnetic performance characteristics. Released in 2014 at 899 USD, the HE-560 represented HiFiMAN's attempt to balance planar magnetic technology with improved comfort through weight reduction. The headphone features 45-ohm impedance and 90dB sensitivity, designed to work with moderate amplification while delivering the wide soundstage characteristic of open-back planar designs.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurements reveal moderate scientific performance. Audio Science Review measurements show frequency response deviations exceeding ±3dB across key midrange frequencies, placing it in the borderline problematic category per headphone measurement criteria [1]. DIY Audio Heaven measurements confirm significant frequency response irregularities including a notable dip at 2kHz that reduces vocal presence, though channel balance performance meets transparent levels [2]. Total harmonic distortion performance remains well below 0.05%, meeting transparent level standards for headphone categories. The combination of acceptable distortion performance with frequency response deviations beyond transparent levels yields moderate scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The HE-560's single-sided planar design represented moderate innovation at release, successfully reducing weight by approximately 30% compared to traditional dual-magnet planar implementations. The proprietary magnet arrangement achieved measurable weight reduction with maintained driver control. However, the technology lacks cutting-edge sophistication, relying on analog-only approaches without digital integration or advanced signal processing capabilities. The design has been replicated by competitors, indicating limited competitive advantage duration. Released in 2014 without subsequent technological updates, the HE-560 represents mid-decade planar magnetic implementation that has been surpassed by newer approaches incorporating advanced materials and manufacturing techniques.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Current HE-560 V4 open-box pricing at 229 USD faces competition from the HiFiMAN HE400SE, available at approximately 77 USD with equivalent measured performance [3][4]. Both headphones provide open-back design with similar impedance characteristics and comparable measured frequency response patterns confirmed by Audio Science Review measurements. The HE400SE delivers equivalent frequency response range (20Hz-35kHz), similar sensitivity (91dB vs 90dB), and comparable THD performance under 0.05%. Both products achieve equivalent user-facing functionality and measured performance levels across key acoustic parameters. CP = 77 USD ÷ 229 USD = 0.3.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

HiFiMAN provides 1-year warranty coverage, below the 2-year industry average for this product category. The planar magnetic driver design introduces inherent fragility compared to dynamic alternatives, requiring careful handling to prevent damage. User reports indicate some quality control concerns typical of HiFiMAN products from this era, though customer service response has been generally positive when issues arise. The combination of shorter warranty coverage and inherent design vulnerability impacts reliability evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

HiFiMAN demonstrates limited design rationality with the HE-560. While the single-sided magnet approach represents rational weight reduction engineering, the persistence of significant frequency response deviations across multiple production versions suggests insufficient commitment to measurement-based optimization. The conservative analog-only approach avoids modern digital signal processing technologies that could address measured deficiencies. Cost reduction from 899 USD to 229 USD shows effective manufacturing optimization, but the lack of acoustic refinement based on measurement feedback indicates limited scientific approach to sound quality improvement.

## Advice

The HE-560 V4 provides entry-level access to planar magnetic technology at excellent current pricing. The 229 USD open-box price from HiFiMAN represents outstanding value for planar magnetic implementation, though frequency response irregularities limit overall performance quality. Potential purchasers should weigh the cost advantages of being the cheapest planar magnetic option against documented quality control concerns and acoustic performance limitations. Those seeking planar magnetic characteristics will find no cheaper equivalent, while users prioritizing neutral frequency response should consider equalization or alternative technologies. Factor potential reliability issues and shorter warranty coverage into purchase decisions given HiFiMAN's historical quality control challenges.
