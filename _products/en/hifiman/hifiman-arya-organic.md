## Overview

The HiFiMAN Arya Organic is the fourth iteration in the Arya line, combining a nanometer-thick diaphragm with “Stealth Magnets” and a reduced 16-ohm impedance for easier drive. Official specifications list 94 dB sensitivity and 8 Hz–65 kHz bandwidth [1]. As of August 2025, multiple major US retailers list the Arya Organic at 979 USD, reflecting a lasting price reduction from launch [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Third-party measurements on a B&K 5128 rig show a broadly neutral response with modest treble structure typical of 5128 captures and good channel matching; no gross response defects are evident [2]. Manufacturer specs confirm 16 Ω impedance and 94 dB sensitivity [1]. While both Arya Organic and Arya Stealth are spec’d at 94 dB, one independent review measured ~3 dB higher SPL for Organic under identical conditions (88 dB vs 85 dB at the same setting), suggesting slightly greater real-world sensitivity on that bench; methodology and rig differ from 5128 and results should be treated as context, not a standard [7]. Comprehensive THD data for Organic on common labs are limited; however, closely related Arya Stealth has shown wideband harmonic distortion well below the 0.5% “problematic” threshold at typical listening levels (e.g., 0.23% at 94 dB SPL) [9]. Overall, publicly available data support strong measured fidelity for an open-back planar.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Arya Organic applies incremental engineering: low-turbulence magnet geometry (“Stealth Magnets”) and a nanometer-class diaphragm to reduce moving mass and diffraction [1]. The change to 16 Ω improves amplifier compatibility versus earlier Arya revisions [1]. These constitute solid, evolution-type refinements rather than category-defining breakthroughs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better):** Dan Clark Audio ÆON 2 Open. It is an open-back planar with similar user-visible functions, published efficiency around 94 dB (Open) and 13 Ω impedance, and is widely regarded to achieve competitive frequency-response and low distortion when equalized to target [4][5][6]. **Equivalence note:** Open-back planar design, comparable sensitivity and bandwidth; third-party FR datasets exist for both models [2][6].

- **Prices (representative street):** ÆON 2 Open 899.99 USD (official store) [4]; Arya Organic 979 USD (major US retailer) [3].  
- **CP formula:** 899.99 USD ÷ 979 USD = 0.92 → **0.9** after rounding.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

HiFiMAN provides a limited **1-year** headphone warranty with an optional 6-month extension upon registration; standard contact/support channels are published [8]. Broader community sentiment on long-term reliability is mixed across models, so we refrain from generalizing beyond the formal warranty terms. Documentation and parts availability are typical for the segment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Design choices prioritize measurable factors (reduced impedance for amplifier pairing, magnet geometry to limit wave turbulence, low-mass diaphragm) over non-falsifiable claims [1][2]. The ongoing price normalization to 979 USD improves accessibility. The approach is rational and measurement-aligned, if iterative rather than revolutionary.

## Advice

The Arya Organic is a strong “transparent-aimed” open-back planar option that scales with source quality and benefits from modest headroom in amplification due to 16 Ω/94 dB characteristics [1][2]. Value-focused buyers should also audition or consider the Dan Clark Audio ÆON 2 Open at a lower price with comparable measured potential; some may prefer its foldable form factor and build [4][5]. If you need isolation, consider closed-back alternatives; if you want maximum stage size or different treble balance, compare within the broader planar field using 5128-based measurements where available [2][6].
