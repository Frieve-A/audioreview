## Overview

The HiFiMAN Susvara represents the company’s former flagship planar magnetic headphone at 6,000 USD, now superseded by the Susvara Unveiled. This open-back design uses HiFiMAN’s stealth magnet structure and a nanometer-thick diaphragm. It features dual 3.5 mm connectors with detachable cables for both 1/4" and 4-pin XLR connections. At roughly 450 g with 60 Ω impedance and extremely low sensitivity, the Susvara demands substantial amplification to reach high listening levels.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Independent lab measurements show technical weaknesses that can affect transparency. SoundStage’s GRAS-based tests report **very low sensitivity of 80.6 dB SPL per 1 mW** and a **spectral-decay plot with numerous strong resonances across the audioband** (noted as among the most the author has measured for open-back planars). Hi-Fi News’ lab report further describes the **uncorrected frequency response as “ragged from about 250 Hz upwards,” with reduced output around ~3 kHz**, implying a wide hole in perceived lower-treble energy; both sources nonetheless note low harmonic distortion overall. These data indicate audible-range irregularities despite otherwise low THD, justifying a below-average score for scientific validity. [SoundStage; Hi-Fi News]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The nanometer diaphragm and “stealth” magnet design are advanced planar magnetic technologies. However, implementation choices appear to favor minimal damping, correlating with the many high-Q resonances visible in independent tests. The technical platform is sophisticated, but execution falls short of best-in-class acoustic control.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

A cheaper **equivalent-or-better** alternative exists:

- **HiFiMAN Sundara (2020)** — open-back planar magnetic headphone. Measured performance from RTINGS shows **excellent target compliance** (e.g., mid-range RMS deviation 1.4 dB) and **very low harmonic distortion** (**0.04 % @ 94 dB SPL / 0.09 % @ 104 dB SPL**). **Sensitivity is 105.0 dB SPL per 1 V**, indicating far easier drive. Function and measured performance are thus **equal or better** for user-relevant axes (FR compliance and THD), with no functional deficit versus Susvara. [RTINGS]

Cheapest verified market price for the comparator at the time of review: **229 USD** (official store promotional price). **Cost-performance calculation:** 229 USD ÷ 6,000 USD = **0.038**, rounded to **0.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

HiFiMAN offers standard warranty and established global distribution. Build quality is typical of the brand’s high-end models. The extreme power requirement, however, increases total system complexity (amp selection, potential cost) beyond the headphone itself.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Prioritizing ultra-low sensitivity and minimal damping does not translate into superior measurable transparency. Given abundant resonances and FR irregularities, and the availability of cheaper models with cleaner measured behavior, the design direction appears misaligned with evidence-based fidelity goals.

## Advice

If you want an objectively well-measuring open-back planar that’s easy to drive, the **Sundara (2020)** delivers excellent FR compliance and very low distortion at a tiny fraction of the Susvara’s price. Prospective Susvara owners should factor in the need for powerful amplification, which significantly raises total system cost without measurable advantages over cheaper, well-measured alternatives.
