## Overview

The HiFiMAN Edition S represents the company's departure from their renowned planar magnetic expertise into conventional dynamic driver territory. This convertible headphone offers both open-back and closed-back operation through detachable magnetic caps, essentially providing two headphones in one package. Featuring 50mm dynamic drivers with 113 dB sensitivity and 18-ohm impedance, the Edition S targets portable use with smartphone compatibility. At 248 grams with foldable design, it emphasizes portability and versatility over HiFiMAN's typical high-end planar magnetic approach.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Edition S suffers from significant measurement deficiencies that prevent proper scientific evaluation. Third-party measurements from DIY-Audio-Heaven reveal problematic channel balance with differences reaching up to 4dB at certain frequencies, substantially affecting stereo imaging quality [1]. The frequency response exhibits consumer-oriented tuning with emphasized bass and scooped midrange, prioritizing subjective appeal over neutral accuracy. While basic specifications show adequate frequency response (15Hz-22kHz) and sensitivity (113 dB), critical performance metrics including THD, SNR, dynamic range, and IMD remain unmeasured. Without comprehensive measurement data for core audio performance indicators, the product cannot be evaluated against transparent level criteria. The available evidence suggests performance below professional standards due to channel matching issues and non-neutral tuning.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Edition S employs conventional 50mm dynamic driver technology without significant innovation or proprietary advancement. The convertible open/closed-back mechanism using detachable magnetic caps provides functional versatility but represents mature mechanical engineering rather than cutting-edge technology. This marks HiFiMAN's first dynamic driver implementation, departing from their established planar magnetic expertise where they possess competitive advantages. The mechanical design includes standard foldable architecture and single-entry cable with inline remote. While the convertible concept offers practical utility, it lacks proprietary patent technology, advanced material science, or sophisticated implementation that other manufacturers would seek to emulate. The technology represents widely available approaches rather than advancement in headphone engineering.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

At 249 USD, the Edition S faces severe cost-performance challenges when compared to equivalent alternatives. The Audio-Technica ATH-M20x provides equivalent user-facing functions with superior measured performance at significantly lower cost. Both offer closed-back operation, 3.5mm connectivity, and portable design, but the ATH-M20x demonstrates superior THD performance and proper channel matching at 40 USD [2]. Equipped with equivalent frequency response range and superior technical implementation, the ATH-M20x represents functionally equivalent performance. CP = 40 USD รท 249 USD = 0.16. The Edition S commands over six times the price without providing measurable performance advantages, making it one of the poorest cost-performance propositions in the headphone market.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

HiFiMAN provides standard manufacturer warranty terms with one-year coverage, extendable by six months through product registration [3]. Customer support operates through established phone and email channels with RMA processes for authorized dealers. However, the company faces documented quality control issues with widespread criticism regarding manufacturing standards. Common reported problems include faulty drivers, buzzing sounds, cable connection failures, and broken headband components [4]. While the dynamic driver construction offers inherently simpler design compared to planar magnetic products, HiFiMAN's overall track record shows higher than average failure rates. Support infrastructure exists but lacks exceptional response times or comprehensive coverage, with customers bearing shipping costs for warranty claims.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Edition S represents a concerning departure from HiFiMAN's scientifically-oriented planar magnetic expertise toward conventional dynamic driver technology without clear performance justification. The convertible design concept prioritizes functional versatility over optimized acoustic performance, lacking scientific basis for sound quality improvement compared to purpose-built designs. Consumer-oriented tuning with emphasized bass and scooped midrange abandons measurement-focused approaches in favor of subjective appeal. While low impedance design appropriately targets smartphone compatibility, the overall approach suggests market expansion and cost reduction rather than advancement toward transparent level performance. The absence of proprietary technology, cutting-edge implementation, or measurable improvements indicates a conservative commercial strategy rather than innovative engineering direction.

## Advice

The Edition S cannot be recommended based on objective performance criteria. The 249 USD price commands premium positioning without delivering corresponding performance advantages over budget alternatives. Prospective buyers seeking convertible functionality should consider purpose-built solutions or invest in separate open and closed headphones from manufacturers with superior cost-performance ratios. Those prioritizing HiFiMAN products should focus on their planar magnetic offerings where the company demonstrates technological competency. For budget-conscious consumers requiring closed-back portable headphones, the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x provides superior technical implementation at substantially lower cost.
