## Overview

HiFiMAN's Ananda-BT represents the company's premium wireless planar magnetic headphones, featuring the proprietary **HYMALAYA** R2R DAC and Neo SuperNano Diaphragm technology. Originally released as a wireless variant of the acclaimed wired Ananda, the latest R2R version adds **Bluetooth 5.1**, a refreshed architecture including **stealth magnets**, and a claimed ~10-hour battery life [1][5]. The open-back design targets listeners who want wireless convenience without giving up the airy soundstage typical of planar magnetic drivers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, transparent third-party measurements for the **2024–2025 R2R** revision remain limited. Manufacturer specs list **8Hz–55kHz** frequency response, **25Ω** impedance, **103dB** sensitivity, and ~10h play time [1]. While legacy third-party data exist for the **original 2019/2020 Ananda-BT** (not the R2R update) from RTings, comprehensive current metrics such as 20Hz–20kHz frequency-response deviation vs. target, THD, SNR, crosstalk, and dynamic range for the R2R model have not been broadly published [3]. Given policy rules, we hold the baseline at **0.5** until updated independent measurements for the R2R version are available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

HiFiMAN integrates proprietary technologies including the **HYMALAYA R2R** DAC module, the ultra-thin **Neo SuperNano** diaphragm, and **stealth magnet** architecture [1]. Wireless implementation is modern with **Bluetooth 5.1** and codec support for **LDAC, aptX HD, aptX, AAC, and SBC** per the current manual [1]. The engineering sophistication is high; however, in line with our policy, the score reflects technology depth rather than proven audible gains.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At **799 USD** [5], the Ananda-BT competes directly with the **Audeze Maxwell** at **299 USD** (PlayStation version; Xbox 329 USD) [2]. From a user-facing standpoint, Maxwell offers **planar magnetic drivers (90mm)**, **Bluetooth 5.3 with LDAC/LC3plus/LE Audio**, and an **80+ hour** battery life—core wireless and fidelity functions that are equivalent-or-better for most users; third-party testing also reports strong frequency-response behavior [2][4].  
CP calculation (policy formula): **299 USD ÷ 799 USD = 0.374 → 0.4** (first decimal rounding).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

HiFiMAN provides a **1-year warranty** per the current owner’s guide [1]. Construction is simple with few moving parts, but the **~10h** battery life is far below class leaders (e.g., Maxwell’s **80+ hours** [2]). Replacement guidance routes through manufacturer support [1]. Balancing average warranty, short battery longevity, and established global distribution/support yields **0.5**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The R2R implementation and discrete topology are technically interesting, yet no consistent, independently verified superiority over modern delta-sigma approaches in THD/DR/SINAD is demonstrated [1]. The open-back wireless concept is niche and forgoes isolation benefits typical for mobile wireless use. Nonetheless, the coherent integration of proprietary planar tech and modern BT stack is rational for an audiophile-leaning use case.

## Advice

If you want **wireless planar** performance with far longer battery life and robust multi-platform support, the **Audeze Maxwell** at 299 USD is a strong value [2][4]. The Ananda-BT suits listeners prioritizing HiFiMAN’s house tuning, an **open-back** presentation, and the **R2R** processing path, accepting the short battery window. For strictly **wired** listening at similar sonic goals without wireless complexity, consider HiFiMAN’s current **wired Ananda series** (e.g., **Ananda Unveiled** at **549 USD**) [10].
