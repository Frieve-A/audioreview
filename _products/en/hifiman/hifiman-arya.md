## Overview

The HiFiMan Arya Stealth Magnet Version represents the third generation of HiFiMan's mid-tier planar magnetic headphones, featuring proprietary stealth magnet technology and nanometer thickness diaphragm. Originally launched at 1,599 USD, the product has undergone significant price reductions to achieve market competitiveness at its current 599 USD positioning. The headphones target audiophiles and studio professionals seeking open-back planar magnetic reproduction with HiFiMan's signature sound characteristics.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Measured performance demonstrates excellent distortion characteristics across the frequency spectrum. THD measurements show very low distortion, usually staying between 0.1 and 0.2%, which is outstanding performance [1][2]. While peak measurements reach 2% in deep bass (20Hz) and 0.5% in treble, these represent outlier conditions rather than typical performance, with the bass distortion at 20Hz being inaudible at such low frequencies [2]. The 94 dB sensitivity provides adequate drive capability, while the 32Ω impedance with near-zero phase shift ensures excellent amplifier compatibility [3].

Frequency response measurements show good compliance from 80Hz-1kHz with some deviation in upper frequencies. Audio Science Review confirms solid performance up to 3kHz with noted peaking around 4.2kHz [1]. While the frequency response shows some deviations from perfect linearity, the excellent THD performance across most of the frequency spectrum places this headphone well within transparent level criteria for headphone products.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Arya incorporates proprietary technologies developed by HiFiMan, including stealth magnet technology that shapes magnets to reduce diffraction turbulence and nanometer thickness diaphragm technology positioned as breakthrough core development [4]. The large 13cm x 10cm planar magnetic drivers demonstrate appropriate scale and in-house design capabilities.

However, the underlying planar magnetic approach represents mature technology. The product relies entirely on analog/mechanical approaches without digital integration or advanced features that characterize modern audio products. Based on the evaluation framework, analog-only approaches receive adjustment from the 0.5 base, and the technology represents competent execution of established principles rather than breakthrough advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Current market price for the HiFiMan Arya Stealth Magnet is 599 USD. The HiFiMan Sundara provides equivalent core functionality as an open-back planar magnetic headphone with similar impedance characteristics (32Ω vs 32Ω), comparable sensitivity (94dB vs 94dB), and equivalent THD performance in the transparent range [5][6]. Both products feature planar magnetic drivers with similar acoustic performance characteristics, making the Sundara functionally equivalent for the intended use case.

Note: Current Sundara pricing requires verification for accurate CP calculation. Based on available market data suggesting approximately 229 USD pricing:
CP = 229 USD ÷ 599 USD = 0.38

Rounded to first decimal place: **0.4**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

HiFiMan provides a standard 1-year warranty period, below industry average. Build quality assessment reveals significant concerns including problematic detachable cable system with reports of cables falling out and one instance of amplifier short-circuiting [7]. The headband adjustment mechanism is described as clunky with poor tactile feedback.

Industry-wide quality control issues are well-documented, with HiFiMan facing criticism for longstanding quality control problems [8]. Repair infrastructure is inadequate, with reports indicating no replacement parts availability and products are never repaired according to importers [9]. Customer support requires customers to pay shipping costs for warranty claims.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

HiFiMan's design philosophy demonstrates sound scientific rationality in key areas. The stealth magnet technology represents a systematic approach to reducing wave diffraction turbulence through acoustic transparency, directly addressing measurable acoustic performance [4]. The nanometer diaphragm technology represents breakthrough core development that contributes to reduced distortion and improved transducer performance as evidenced in measured results.

The technical approaches employed show legitimate scientific basis rather than unmeasurable claims. The stealth magnet design specifically targets wave diffraction reduction, which correlates with the measured low distortion performance. The nanometer thickness diaphragm technology addresses fundamental transducer physics. While the product utilizes analog/mechanical approaches rather than digital integration, the implemented technologies demonstrate rational engineering focused on measurable acoustic improvements rather than subjective enhancement claims.

## Advice

For users prioritizing measured acoustic performance in planar magnetic reproduction, the Arya demonstrates excellent THD performance with outstanding distortion characteristics in the 0.1-0.2% range across most frequencies. The 94dB sensitivity and 32Ω impedance provide good amplifier compatibility. However, potential buyers should carefully consider reliability concerns including documented quality control issues and inadequate repair infrastructure. The significant price reduction from launch indicates better value alternatives exist, particularly the HiFiMan Sundara which provides comparable core functionality at substantially lower cost. Purchase decisions should factor in the 1-year warranty limitation, reports of fragile cable connections, and the superior cost-performance of alternatives.
