## Overview

The HIFIMAN HE600 represents a modern update to the company's planar magnetic headphone lineup, featuring the second-generation NEO Supernano diaphragm and enhanced magnet system. Priced at 799 USD, this open-back design addresses the notorious power requirements of its predecessor, the HE6, by offering improved efficiency with 28-30Ω impedance and 94-108 dB sensitivity [1][2]. The HE600 incorporates HIFIMAN's proprietary Stealth Magnet technology alongside the rare-earth-free enhanced magnet system, targeting audiophiles seeking planar magnetic performance without extreme amplification demands. Weighing 390 grams with dual 3.5mm connectors, the headphones maintain the company's focus on thin-film driver technology for dynamic sound reproduction.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Third-party measurements from unheardlab.com demonstrate that the HE600 achieves approximately ±3 dB variation from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, meeting the standard criteria for headphones but falling short of the ±1 dB excellence threshold [1]. Channel matching shows very good performance, and dynamic compression remains minimal (<0.5 dB) below 20 Hz at 105 dB SPL [1]. However, critical measurement data for total harmonic distortion and signal-to-noise ratio are not publicly available from independent sources, limiting comprehensive performance evaluation. The measured frequency response meets basic transparency requirements but does not demonstrate exceptional accuracy compared to reference standards. Impedance characteristics show the typical flat, low-impedance curve expected from planar magnetic designs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The HE600 incorporates HIFIMAN's proprietary NEO Supernano diaphragm technology, reported to be 40% thinner than previous generations, along with the company's Stealth Magnet implementation [2][3]. This represents genuine in-house design ownership with accumulated technical expertise in planar magnetic driver development. The enhanced magnet system utilizes rare-earth-free materials while maintaining magnetic field strength, demonstrating environmental consideration in material selection. However, the technology remains primarily analog and mechanical without advanced digital integration or software enhancement capabilities. While the innovations show technical competence and industry experience, they do not represent cutting-edge advancement beyond established planar magnetic principles.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. At 799 USD, the HE600 faces strong competition from equivalent-or-better alternatives. The Sennheiser HD560S, priced at 166 USD, provides superior measured performance with 110-111 dB sensitivity, 0.05% THD at 1kHz/90dB SPL, and lighter 240g weight while delivering comparable frequency response range [4][5]. Both are open-back designs suitable for audiophile applications. The HD560S offers equivalent-or-better functionality with higher measured sensitivity, excellent measured THD data, and reduced weight at significantly lower cost.

CP = 166 USD ÷ 799 USD = 0.21

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

HIFIMAN provides standard 2-year warranty coverage for the HE600, consistent with industry norms for headphone products [6]. The company maintains global manufacturer support infrastructure with direct customer service channels and established repair processes. Planar magnetic driver construction offers reasonable durability expectations given the relatively simple mechanical design with fewer moving parts compared to dynamic drivers. HIFIMAN's established track record in planar magnetic headphone manufacturing provides confidence in long-term component availability and technical support capabilities. The warranty covers manufacturing defects under normal use conditions, with standard exclusions for damage from accidents or unauthorized modifications.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

HIFIMAN's design philosophy demonstrates mixed rationality in the HE600 implementation. While legitimate efficiency improvements over the original HE6 represent practical progress, the high pricing relative to measured performance suggests poor cost optimization. Claims regarding Stealth Magnet acoustic transparency and wave diffraction reduction lack clear scientific validation through controlled testing methodology [3]. The company's focus on proprietary technology development shows innovation attitude, but the cost-effectiveness of these implementations remains questionable given available alternatives. Marketing emphasis on unmeasurable acoustic properties rather than verified performance improvements indicates suboptimal resource allocation. The approach prioritizes technical differentiation over cost-effective performance delivery to end users.

## Advice

The HE600 appeals primarily to HIFIMAN enthusiasts seeking the brand's latest planar magnetic technology implementations. However, objective performance data does not justify the 799 USD premium over alternatives like the Sennheiser HD560S, which delivers superior measured specifications at one-fifth the cost. Potential purchasers should carefully evaluate whether brand preference and proprietary technology features warrant the significant price differential. Those prioritizing measured performance and cost-effectiveness will find better value in competing products. The HE600 may suit buyers specifically requiring HIFIMAN's design aesthetic or those upgrading from older, less efficient planar magnetic models within the same ecosystem.
