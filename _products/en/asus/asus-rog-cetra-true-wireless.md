## Overview

The ASUS ROG Cetra True Wireless is a gaming-focused true wireless earbud designed specifically for gaming applications. Since its release in 2022, it features 10mm custom-tuned drivers, hybrid active noise cancellation, and up to 27 hours of battery life. The design minimizes audio latency in gaming through low-latency Bluetooth connectivity and includes IPX4 water resistance. As part of ASUS's gaming brand ROG, while it lacks RGB lighting, it offers customization capabilities through the Armoury Crate application.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This product features a frequency response spanning 20Hz-20kHz with V-shaped tuning implementation. Available measurement data indicates emphasized low and high frequencies with relatively recessed midrange. The frequency response significantly exceeds the transparent level of ±0.5dB, particularly showing substantial deviations in the bass region that compromise fidelity to the master source. While official THD specifications are not publicly available from ASUS, independent measurements suggest performance within industry norms, though the V-shaped tuning affects overall transparency and falls below the transparent level performance outlined in the measurement standards table.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 10mm neodymium Essence driver adopts an appropriate size, achieving technical specifications of 32-ohm impedance. The hybrid ANC technology provides substantial noise attenuation performance, delivering industry-standard level results. Low-latency Bluetooth implementation achieves reduced latency for gaming applications, while Bluetooth 5.3 and SBC/AAC codec support represent current standard technical levels. No proprietary technologies or unique acoustic engineering approaches have been confirmed, remaining overall a combination of existing technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Based on current market research, the ASUS ROG Cetra True Wireless (original model) is available at approximately 119.99 USD through various retailers. Multiple alternatives exist offering equivalent functionality including gaming low-latency, ANC, and comparable battery performance. The most affordable equivalent product is the EarFun Air Pro 4 (77.39 USD), which provides adaptive ANC, low-latency gaming mode, and superior battery life. The JBL Quantum TWS (89.95 USD) also stands as a competitive product with dedicated gaming features. Through the calculation of 77.39 USD ÷ 119.99 USD = 0.65, this product's cost-performance is evaluated at 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

ASUS provides industry-standard warranty periods with established support infrastructure in Japan. Quality control as an ROG brand maintains consistent standards, though due to the nature of true wireless earbuds, long-term guarantees for battery degradation and connection stability are limited. Firmware update support through the Armoury Crate app is commendable, though update frequency and proactive feature additions remain at standard levels compared to competitors.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design philosophy of gaming-focused tuning demonstrates limited rationality despite addressing specific market needs. Implementation of low-latency connectivity and ANC functionality enhances practicality in gaming environments. However, the V-shaped frequency response with substantial bass emphasis lacks scientific foundation for faithful audio reproduction, ultimately sacrificing audio quality for subjective preference. This approach is particularly problematic when competing products achieve gaming functionality without compromising acoustic transparency. Even for gaming-focused products, designs that deviate significantly from neutral frequency response represent fundamentally irrational choices from an audio fidelity perspective.

## Advice

The ASUS ROG Cetra True Wireless offers certain value for users seeking gaming-specific functionality, but cannot be recommended for audio quality-conscious users. Current market alternatives such as the EarFun Air Pro 4 (77.39 USD) and JBL Quantum TWS (89.95 USD) provide equivalent gaming functionality at more affordable prices, though the cost difference is less extreme than previously calculated. The product holds meaning for users who prioritize ASUS brand reliability and Armoury Crate app integration. Even for gaming applications, there is no necessity to sacrifice scientific audio validity, and alternatives with better acoustic characteristics exist. This product's V-shaped tuning may cause auditory fatigue and requires caution for extended use. The choice comes down to competitive products for price-conscious users or this product for brand-conscious users.
