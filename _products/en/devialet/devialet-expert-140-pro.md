## Overview

The Devialet Expert 140 Pro is an all-in-one integrated amplifier combining preamp, amplifier, DAC, streamer, and phono stage in a single aluminum chassis. Rated at 140W into 6Ω (≈105W into 8Ω), it employs Devialet's Analog Digital Hybrid (ADH) amplification and Speaker Active Matching (SAM). Supported digital formats include PCM up to 32-bit/192kHz via USB (24-bit/192kHz via AIR/Roon Ready/UPnP) and DSD64 (USB/coax). Streaming protocols include UPnP, Air/Devialet AIR, AirPlay, Spotify Connect, and Roon Ready. List price is 6,490 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent measurements show mixed performance. On the analog inputs, the FFT noise bins sit at or below −80dB, indicating ~14-bit effective resolution; wideband S/N at 2.83V is 59.5dB unweighted (68dB A-weighted), far below transparency thresholds. Output impedance is low (~0.05Ω measured), and continuous power before 1% THD+N is ~103W/8Ω and ~205W/4Ω. Minimum THD+N observed is ~0.02%. Protection engages under sustained high-power, high-frequency IMD tests, limiting continuous HF output. Via digital inputs, resolution approaches ~20 bits in one channel, though the opposite channel shows a higher, scalloped noise floor.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

ADH combines Class-A voltage gain with Class-D current drive; SAM uses laser-based transducer characterization to build per-speaker models for real-time correction. Expert Pro systems are Roon Ready. Devialet claims 160+ patents across its tech stack. Integration of preamp, DAC, streamer, and configurable phono stage in a 40 mm-thin chassis remains an advanced system design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Benchmark comparator (lowest-priced product with equal or greater functionality and measured performance): **NAD C 389 + MDC2 BluOS-D** (total 2,498 USD). C 389 supplies 130W/8Ω, MM phono, and strong measured performance; MDC2 BluOS-D adds full streaming (BluOS, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect) and Dirac Live room correction. Against 6,490 USD for the Devialet, the Expert 140 Pro’s cost-performance is poor.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Warranty for Expert purchases made after 2023-06-21 is 2 years (previously 5). Devialet’s help pages and official product pages emphasize the current 2-year term. The 140 Pro runs warm in testing and should be well ventilated. Devialet markets “Devialet Care” warranty extensions primarily for Phantom/Mania/Dione; no Expert-specific Care product is offered on current pages as of the access date.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The engineering intent—hybrid ADH amplification plus SAM loudspeaker modeling—is coherent and innovative. However, the analog-input noise performance and protection behavior under HF stress do not align with the premium pricing when compared to lower-cost, better-measuring integrated/streaming solutions.

## Advice

Choose the Expert 140 Pro if you value compact industrial design, rich streaming support including Roon Ready, and SAM benefits with compatible speakers. If you prioritize measured transparency and value, consider **NAD C 389 + MDC2 BluOS-D** (significantly cheaper, adds Dirac) or **Cambridge Audio Evo 150** (150W/8Ω, MM phono, full streaming) as stronger technical/value propositions.
