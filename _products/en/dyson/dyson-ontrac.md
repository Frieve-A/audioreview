## Overview

Dyson’s second-generation headphones drop the Zone’s visor and focus purely on audio. OnTrac launched on July 18, 2024 at 500 USD, emphasizing durable metal construction and extensive color customization (>2,000 cap/cushion combos) [1][2]. Key facts: spec weight **0.451 kg** (manufacturer), **up to 55 h** playback with ANC (manufacturer), **40 mm** drivers, **8 ANC mics** (manufacturer) [1][2]. Independent data: **~51.1 h** continuous playback with ANC, **overall attenuation −18.63 dB** (full-range ANC isolation), **Bluetooth with multipoint (2 devices)** and **LHDC/AAC** verified in testing, and **no analog audio out of the box** (optional In-Flight Adapter enables wired listening but disables ANC) [3]. Note: manufacturer pages list Bluetooth **5.0–5.3** by region/firmware; third-party testing unit reported **v5.0** [1][3][8].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

- **ANC (quantitative):** overall attenuation **−18.63 dB** (Airplane −18.59 / Office −17.90 / Street −20.79). Leaders like **Sony WH-1000XM5** reach **−25.81 dB** [3][4].  
- **Battery (quantitative):** **51.1 h** with ANC measured vs **55 h** claim [3][1].  
- **Wireless/codec:** **Multipoint (2)**, **LHDC/AAC** seen in testing; Bluetooth version varies by source as noted above [3][1][8].  
- **Distortion (spec):** **0.1% THD @94 dB/1 kHz** (manufacturer) [1].  
- **Weight:** **0.451 kg** spec; lab mass around **~454 g** [1][3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

40 mm neodymium drivers with generally stable imaging and an 8-mic ANC architecture; app features include mode switching and preset EQ. However, the EQ lacks parametric control, Bluetooth stack on the tested unit is **v5.0**, and sub-bass attenuation trails leaders in measurements [2][3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **Sony WH-1000XM5** at **299.99 USD** (current US market), offering **stronger ANC (−25.81 dB)**, **lighter build (~0.55 lb)**, and **wired playback included** [4][6].  
**Calculation (explicit):** **299.99 USD ÷ 500 USD = 0.60** → score **0.6** (rounded).  
Rationale: Same core functions, superior measured ANC, and lower mass; other options (e.g., Bose QC Ultra) exist but are pricier [7].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Two-year warranty (regions vary) and official spare parts/cosmetic modules available; multipoint supported; optional wired adapter disables ANC; firmware via MyDyson app [1][3][8]. No long-term reliability track record yet for this model; high mass may affect comfort longevity.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Solid engineering and modularity, yet choices like higher mass and omission of native analog I/O reduce practical gains versus peers. Investments seem tilted to industrial design/customization rather than measurable ANC leadership or wired flexibility [1][2][3].

## Advice

Pick OnTrac if you prioritize **build quality**, **long battery life**, and **style customization** over absolute ANC leadership or wired flexibility. If you want **stronger ANC at a lower price**, the **Sony WH-1000XM5 (299.99 USD)** is the better buy; Bose QC Ultra remains a high-performing (but pricier) alternative [4][6][7].
