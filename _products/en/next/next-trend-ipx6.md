## Overview

The NEXT Trend IPX6 is a waterproof portable Bluetooth speaker manufactured by NEXT Audiogroup, a Portuguese company established in 1986. The speaker features IPX6 water resistance, 30W RMS power output with twin 3" full-range drivers and dual passive radiators, Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity with TWS pairing capability, and up to 15 hours of battery life. NEXT Audiogroup has extensive experience in professional audio manufacturing with over 1,000 products and exports to 45+ countries worldwide.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Third-party measurements are unavailable; however, the manufacturer specification already indicates a limited frequency response of 80Hz–16kHz, which does not satisfy wideband reproduction requirements. As shown in [1], this fact is insufficient as an audio-quality indicator, and no deviation (±dB), THD, S/N, or IMD data are provided. When problem-level limitations are evident at the specification stage, Scientific Validity is downgraded to 0.3.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

NEXT demonstrates solid technical capabilities with in-house Portuguese design and engineering since 1986, accumulated electroacoustic expertise, and computer-aided development tools including measurement systems and purpose-designed sound rooms. The company uses computer-controlled manufacturing with comprehensive quality testing. However, the Trend IPX6 employs standard Bluetooth 5.0 technology and conventional TWS implementation without significant technical innovation beyond industry norms, representing competent but not cutting-edge engineering.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. At 140 USD, the NEXT Trend IPX6 faces strong competition from the Soundcore Motion 300 (79.99 USD), which offers equivalent 30W power, superior Bluetooth 5.3, better IPX7 waterproof rating, 13-hour battery life, Hi-Res Audio certification with LDAC support, and significantly broader frequency response (65Hz-40kHz vs 80Hz-16kHz). Equipped with equivalent-or-better connectivity, water resistance, and audio performance. CP = 79.99 USD ÷ 140 USD = 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

NEXT Audiogroup provides 24-month warranty coverage with maximum 30-day repair timeframe and dedicated customer support infrastructure including email and phone assistance. The company's 39-year manufacturing history demonstrates proven reliability track record. Products undergo computer-controlled manufacturing with comprehensive computerized quality testing and trained technician approval processes. The 365-day available sales and after-sales service, combined with European manufacturing standards and robust construction quality, indicates strong reliability and support framework.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

NEXT demonstrates measurement-focused development approach using computer-aided loudspeaker design tools, electroacoustic measurement systems, and scientific validation through comprehensive quality testing. The company emphasizes performance verification over subjective claims, aligning with rational audio engineering principles. However, the design philosophy remains conservative without significant innovation, focusing on proven technologies rather than advancing portable speaker performance. Cost allocation appears reasonable for provided functionality without evidence of unnecessary expense inflation or unscientific audio claims.

## Advice

The NEXT Trend IPX6 represents competent Portuguese engineering with solid build quality and reliable support, making it suitable for users prioritizing established European manufacturing and comprehensive warranty coverage. While alternatives like the Soundcore Motion 300 offer better specifications at lower cost, the Trend IPX6 provides reasonable value for users who prioritize NEXT's proven reliability track record and 24-month warranty with European support infrastructure. Consider this speaker if you value established manufacturing heritage and premium support, but evaluate alternatives offering superior Hi-Res Audio capabilities and broader frequency response for audiophile applications.
