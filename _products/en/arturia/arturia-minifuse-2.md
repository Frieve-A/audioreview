## Overview

The Arturia MiniFuse 1 is an entry-level USB-C audio interface developed by the French company Arturia. With a 1-input, 2-output configuration, it achieves best-in-class measured values of 110dB dynamic range and THD+N -100dB (<0.001%), supporting recording up to 192kHz. It features -129dB equivalent input noise and is housed in a robust aluminum case. A 5-year long-term warranty and a rich software bundle are included.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The MiniFuse 1's key measurements are excellent, clearing the "transparency level" where sonic differences become imperceptible to human hearing. The 110dB dynamic range surpasses the transparency standard (105dB or higher), and the THD+N of -100dB (<0.001%) significantly exceeds the transparency threshold (0.01% or lower). Its frequency response is extremely flat at ±0.05dB from 20Hz-20kHz (at minimum gain), also meeting the transparency standard (±0.5dB). These objective measurements scientifically demonstrate its capability for recording and playback that is faithful to the master source.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Technically, it adopts industry-standard design approaches. It solidly combines established technologies like the CIRRUS LOGIC CS4272 stereo codec and XMOS XU208 microcontroller. While its proprietary preamp circuit is excellent, the technical originality and industry-leading innovation are limited. 192kHz support is now a standard specification, and overall, the technology level is at the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The Arturia MiniFuse 1 is priced at approximately 15,000 JPY. Its measured performance is extremely high, rivaling that of higher-end models costing several times more. There are currently no other 1-input, 192kHz-capable audio interfaces on the market that deliver equivalent or superior performance at a lower price than the MiniFuse 1. Therefore, this product is the world's most affordable in its performance class, and according to the review policy, its cost-performance is rated a perfect 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Arturia provides a 5-year hardware warranty, one of the most comprehensive warranties in the industry. As an established audio equipment manufacturer based in France, long-term support can be expected. The MiniFuse Control Centre software provides configuration management and ongoing feature improvements through firmware updates. In terms of reliability and support, it is evaluated as above the industry average standard.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Achieving transparent, high-end measurement performance at an extremely low entry-level price is exceptionally rational and highly commendable. The design philosophy of incorporating practical features like a USB-C connection and loopback functionality while keeping the price down maximizes user benefit. It is a groundbreaking and advanced approach that achieves high performance and low cost with modern technology, without relying on expensive components or unscientific designs.

## Advice

The Arturia MiniFuse 1 is, at present, the most highly recommended 1-input audio interface, offering technically class-leading performance with phenomenal cost-effectiveness. Previously, obtaining equivalent recording quality required a much more expensive product. For any user who demands uncompromising sound quality while on a budget, this is a definitive choice. Factoring in the 5-year warranty and extensive software bundle, its value proposition is overwhelming compared to competitors. If you are looking for a 1-input model, this is an outstanding product that we can recommend without hesitation.
