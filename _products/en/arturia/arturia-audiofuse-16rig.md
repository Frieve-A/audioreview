## Overview

The Arturia AudioFuse 16Rig is a high-density audio interface supporting 16-channel input/output, released in 2023. It features ESS and Cirrus Logic 24-bit AD/DA converters with support for up to 192kHz/24-bit resolution. The unit incorporates DC-coupled outputs and dual MIDI-controllable independent mixers, designed specifically for modular synthesizer and electronic music production. It supports both desktop and 1U rack mounting, with USB-C connectivity and a USB hub function for enhanced expandability.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measured performance achieves transparent levels. Line input THD+N measures -113dB (equivalent to 0.0002%), while output measures -106dB (equivalent to 0.0005%), both significantly below the 0.01% transparent standard. Frequency response measures 20Hz-20kHz ±0.06dB for inputs and ±0.04dB for outputs, well within the ±0.5dB transparent criteria. Dynamic range achieves 118dB for inputs, 120dB for outputs, and 126dB for speaker outputs, all exceeding the 105dB transparent threshold. The microphone preamp's EIN of -129.5dBu is excellent, virtually eliminating audible degradation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption of ESS and Cirrus Logic converters represents the industry standard. The unit achieves functional integration not found in conventional products, including DC-coupled outputs for CV transmission, dual MIDI-controllable independent mixers, and a USB-C hub function. However, the fundamental conversion technology relies on existing high-quality chipsets, with limited proprietary technology development. The 2025 2.0 update announced at NAMM, adding immersive audio support, demonstrates ongoing functional expansion.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

With a market price of 1,299 USD, the comparable PreSonus Quantum 2626, offering similar or superior features, is available for 599.95 USD. The cost-performance is calculated as `599.95 USD ÷ 1,299 USD ≈ 0.46`, resulting in a score of 0.5. While the AudioFuse 16Rig has unique features like DC-coupled outputs and independent mixers, its price competitiveness for core multi-I/O functionality is low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Arturia is an established music equipment manufacturer with a standard support infrastructure. The release of a major 2.0 firmware update in January 2025 demonstrates a commitment to ongoing product improvement. However, specific failure rate data and MTBF are not published, falling short of the long-term reliability track records of manufacturers like RME or MOTU. The warranty period and repair infrastructure are assessed at an industry-average level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The specialization for electronic music production is a rational direction. Features like DC-coupled outputs for modular synthesizer compatibility, dual independent mixers for PC-free audio processing, and a USB-C hub for equipment integration address the needs of modern production environments. The measured performance achieves transparent levels, indicating a design based on scientific principles for audio quality. However, some features may be excessive for general recording applications, making this focused design philosophy potentially divisive.

## Advice

The AudioFuse 16Rig is a specialized interface suited for modular synthesizer and electronic music producers. It provides irreplaceable value in environments requiring DC-coupled outputs and MIDI-controlled mixers. However, for general multi-input recording applications, the PreSonus Quantum 2626 offers superior cost-performance. Given its excellent measured performance, there should be no audio quality concerns when the application is a match. Before purchasing, carefully consider if your production style is specialized in electronic music and if DC-coupled outputs are truly necessary.
