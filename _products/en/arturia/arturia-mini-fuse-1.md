rating: [3.9, 0.8, 0.6, 1.0, 0.8, 0.7]
price: 149
summary: "As an entry-level USB-C audio interface, the MiniFuse 1 offers excellent measured performance. Against the least-expensive equal-or-better 192kHz competitor (Focusrite Scarlett Solo 4th Gen), general retail pricing is effectively the same, so cost-performance scores the maximum when factoring its bundled software and 5-year warranty."

## Overview

The Arturia MiniFuse 1 is an entry-level USB-C audio interface from Arturia (France). It is a 1-in/2-out unit supporting up to 24-bit/192kHz recording and provides a published 110dB dynamic range and class-leading equivalent input noise of −129dB (A-weighted) [1]. The single combo input accepts XLR microphones or 1/4-inch instruments and supplies 48V phantom power. Practical touches include a direct-monitor switch and an additional rear USB hub socket to power small USB devices [1]. A firmware update (“MiniFuse 1.5”) added virtual input/output channels and a low-latency mixer enabling simple loopback/streaming workflows [2]. The chassis is compact metal and offered in black or white [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent write-ups report, at minimum gain, frequency response within about ±0.05–0.06dB from 20Hz–20kHz, dynamic range ≈110dB (A-weighted), and THD+N around −100dB (typ., un-weighted) on mic/line paths—squarely in the “transparency” zone (≥105dB DR and ≤0.01% THD+N) [3]. Arturia’s own figures likewise state 110dB DR and −129dB EIN [1]. However, lab-grade third-party datasets directly documenting the exact measurement setup are not clearly published; therefore we conservatively adjust the score downward slightly despite the consistent reported numbers. 

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design choices—24-bit/192kHz conversion, USB-C connectivity, class-compliant operation, direct monitoring, and software-assisted loopback via the 1.5 update—are solid and modern but industry-standard for this price segment [1][2]. No uniquely novel conversion or DSP features stand out versus peers; hence an average technology score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Pricing basis (USD):** MiniFuse 1 general retail price USD 149 (Arturia store) [4].  
**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better by function *and* measured/spec performance):** Focusrite Scarlett Solo 4th Gen — 24-bit/192kHz; converters with high DR (official materials) and current general retail price around USD 149.99 [5][6][7].  
Given that the least-expensive non-inferior option is essentially the **same price** as MiniFuse 1, the MiniFuse 1 does not suffer a price disadvantage. With comparable or better measured/spec performance versus many low-cost rivals and with a substantial bundled software suite, the cost-performance score is set to the maximum.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Arturia advertises a **5-year hardware warranty** across the MiniFuse range—unusually long for this category—alongside the MiniFuse Control Center utility for updates and configuration [1][2]. The long warranty and continuing feature updates suggest above-average long-term support [1][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The MiniFuse 1’s design focuses on transparent capture, simple monitoring, and creator-friendly loopback, all grounded in measurable performance and practical workflow [1][2][3]. In 2025, some creators may opt for integrated USB mics or all-in-one podcast mixers; nevertheless, a compact dedicated interface with robust drivers and transparent performance remains a rational choice for many entry-level studios.

## Advice

MiniFuse 1 delivers transparent sound, a now-mature software/firmware experience with virtual channels, and one of the longest warranties among budget interfaces. Since the cheapest equivalent competitor (Scarlett Solo 4th Gen) is essentially the same price, your decision comes down to workflow preferences (USB hub port and Arturia’s software bundle vs. Focusrite’s ecosystem). For first-time producers and mobile creators wanting a clean, straightforward path to 192kHz recording, MiniFuse 1 is an easy recommendation.
