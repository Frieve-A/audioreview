summary: "As an entry-level USB-C audio interface, the MiniFuse 1 offers excellent measured performance. When compared to its 192kHz-capable competitor, the Steinberg UR12, the price difference is minor, making its cost-performance reasonable when considering its bundled software and 5-year warranty."

## Overview

The Arturia MiniFuse 1 is an entry-level USB-C audio interface developed by the French company Arturia. With a 1-input, 2-output configuration, it achieves measured values of 110dB dynamic range and THD+N -100dB (<0.001%), supporting recording up to 192kHz. It employs a CIRRUS LOGIC CS4272 stereo codec and XMOS XU208 microcontroller, featuring a 56dB gain range and -129dB equivalent input noise. The combo jack accommodates both XLR microphones and 1/4-inch instruments, with built-in 48V phantom power. Housed in a robust aluminum case, it is available in both black and white color options.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The MiniFuse 1's key measurements are excellent, clearing the "transparency level" where sonic differences become imperceptible to human hearing. The 110dB dynamic range surpasses the transparency standard (105dB or higher), and the THD+N of -100dB (<0.001%) significantly exceeds the transparency threshold (0.01% or lower). Its frequency response is extremely flat at ±0.05dB from 20Hz-20kHz (at minimum gain), also meeting the transparency standard (±0.5dB). These objective measurements scientifically demonstrate its capability for recording and playback that is faithful to the master source.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Technically, it adopts industry-standard design approaches. The CIRRUS LOGIC CS4272 stereo codec is a reliable choice but not particularly innovative technology. The USB implementation using the XMOS XU208 microcontroller and adoption of JRC4580 op-amps are all established technology combinations. While the proprietary preamp circuit achieving a 56dB gain range is commendable, no particularly advantageous technical features are evident compared to other products in the same price range. The 192kHz capability is now a standard specification and offers limited technical innovation. Overall, while representing solid design, the technology level remains at the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The MiniFuse 1 is priced at approximately 15,000 JPY. To account for the latency reduction benefits in music production, we compare it to an equivalent 192kHz/24-bit capable product. One of the most affordable competitors in this category is the "Steinberg UR12," available for about 11,000 JPY. Both products offer nearly identical user features (mic/instrument input, phantom power, monitor output). Based on the formula "11,000 JPY ÷ 15,000 JPY = 0.733...," the score is 0.7. While a price difference exists, the MiniFuse 1 includes added value through its extensive bundled software and a 5-year warranty, making its cost-performance reasonable.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Arturia provides a 5-year hardware warranty, one of the most comprehensive in the industry. As an established audio equipment manufacturer based in France, long-term support can be expected. The MiniFuse Control Centre software provides configuration management functionality and supports firmware updates. The 2024 MiniFuse 1.5 update added virtual input/output channels and a low-latency mixer function, demonstrating ongoing feature improvements. While specific failure rates or MTBF data are not published, based on the company's track record with other products and warranty structure, reliability and support are evaluated as above the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The MiniFuse 1's design philosophy is scientifically rational. It achieves near-transparent sound quality through a measurement-focused approach, with no unscientific claims. The adoption of a USB-C interface and class-compliant support for driverless operation represent a modern, practical design. The compact chassis design prioritizing portability also aligns with the needs of mobile recording. However, questions remain regarding the necessity of a dedicated audio interface. In the modern era, there is an abundance of high-performance alternatives that can connect directly to smartphones and PCs, diminishing the need for single-input interfaces. For applications like podcasting, more integrated solutions exist, leading to a moderate rating for the rationality of its design philosophy.

## Advice

The MiniFuse 1 is a solid audio interface with excellent measured performance and robust support. While it is slightly more expensive than its 192kHz-capable competitor, the "Steinberg UR12," the price difference can be well justified by the extensive bundled software and the 5-year long-term warranty. For users who value not just the hardware performance but also the software assets and long-term peace of mind, the MiniFuse 1 is a very attractive option. It is especially valuable for beginners starting in music production who want to experiment with various sound sources and a DAW. We recommend you make your decision by weighing your budget against your need for software and warranty.
