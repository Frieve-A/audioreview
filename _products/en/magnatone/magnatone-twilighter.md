## Overview

Magnatone’s Twilighter is a hand-wired 22-watt 1×12" tube combo using 6V6 power tubes and a GZ34 rectifier, featuring spring reverb plus Magnatone’s hallmark **true pitch-shifting vibrato**. It targets the premium boutique segment with traditional circuitry and construction, and is sold in 1×12" (USD 3,699 street) and Twilighter Stereo 2×12" variants. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Objective measurements (THD, S/N, FR) for the Twilighter are not published. Known facts: 22 W output via dual 6V6, tube rectification, spring reverb, and an analog varistor-based pitch vibrato that intentionally modulates pitch. In absence of third-party lab data, fidelity is presumed average for a classic tube combo—capable, but not demonstrably transparent by modern standards. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The varistor vibrato is a rare, historically significant analog implementation, and overall build quality appears high. Still, the platform is fundamentally mid-20th-century: no DSP/modeling, limited I/O, and no modern integration. Technical sophistication sits above barebones vintage reissues yet below contemporary modeling ecosystems. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better by user-visible functions)**: BOSS Katana-100 Gen 3 (100 W combo with onboard vibrato-class modulation, reverb, USB/line out, and extensive effects) at **USD 449.99**. It meets or exceeds the Twilighter in output power and feature coverage for typical use, including pitch-modulation effects. The Twilighter’s asking price is therefore many times higher than an equivalent-or-better functional option available on the market, warranting a minimal CP score. [2][3][4]

*(Equivalence note: provides pitch-modulation (vibrato) and reverb, with output power ≥22 W; broader features are a bonus rather than a gap.)*

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Baseline 0.5, +0.1 for Magnatone’s **3-year** amplifier warranty (registration required), −0.1 because tube amps include consumables (tubes) and heat-related wear. Support appears dealer-centric with factory service available; no long-term failure-rate data is published. Net 0.5. [5][6][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product prioritizes historically flavored circuitry (tube rectifier, varistor vibrato) and craftsmanship over measurable transparency or modern functionality. While the vibrato is technically distinctive, the high material/assembly cost does not translate into objectively superior fidelity versus mainstream alternatives.

## Advice

Buy the Twilighter if you specifically want **authentic analog pitch-shifting vibrato** in a boutique, hand-wired package and accept the premium. If your goal is feature breadth, recording I/O, or maximum value, a Katana-100 Gen 3 delivers similar (or broader) functionality and far higher wattage at a fraction of the price; most players gain more versatility and practicality there.
