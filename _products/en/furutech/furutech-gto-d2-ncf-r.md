## Overview

The Furutech GTO-D2-NCF-R is a premium, **unfiltered** power distributor manufactured by Tokyo-based Furutech Co. Ltd. (est. 1988). It uses two **rhodium-plated, non-magnetic phosphor bronze duplex receptacles** (4 outlets total), incorporates the company's NCF (Nano Crystal² Formula) material, a GC-303 EMI absorber, a CNC-machined aluminum chassis, FI-06 NCF(R) IEC inlet, and 106-D Plus NCF outlet covers. Dimensions are 283.4 × 108.5 × 77 mm; net weight is 2.1 kg [1]. Current market pricing used for this review is **900 USD**, derived from Japanese retail pricing[2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

There is **no published independent evidence** that this model improves electrical performance versus a basic power strip under controlled test conditions. Related Furutech devices using NCF material (e.g., NCF Clear Line) have been measured by third parties with **no demonstrable improvement** in noise or other electrical parameters under test [3]. For this product, the manufacturer states an **unfiltered distributor** architecture with GC-303 absorber material but provides no standardized, verifiable performance metrics such as conducted/radiated noise reduction in dB [1]. Accordingly, the scientific validity score remains low pending credible third-party measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Engineering execution (machined aluminum enclosure, phosphor-bronze rhodium-plated contacts, internal μ-OFC Alpha-22 wiring, IEC inlet) is solid within traditional power distribution design. However, there is **no active filtering, surge suppression, or monitoring**—features commonly found in modern power management products. NCF/GC-303 are materials claims without independently verified quantitative benefit. Overall, conventional build quality with limited technological advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Comparator (equal-or-better user-visible functions): **Hyper Tough 6-Outlet Surge Protector, 900 J**, 6 ft cord—provides **≥ outlet count** and **adds surge protection**; for audio power distribution, core function is equivalent or better. Representative market price: **14.49 USD** [4].

**Calculation** (denominator = review target price):  
14.49 ÷ 900 = **0.016** → score **0.0**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Mechanical build appears robust and passive construction limits failure modes. Warranty and support are provided via authorized dealers; no global on-device monitoring or firmware aspects apply [1]. The official spec page does **not list safety certifications** for this model; buyers concerned with compliance should confirm certification status directly with the seller or manufacturer [1]. Absent broader field-failure data, the score remains modest.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Claims around “ultra-quiet soundstage” or “glare reduction” lack **controlled, reproducible measurement evidence**. With no quantifiable benefit over inexpensive power strips—and at a price far exceeding products that match or exceed user-facing functions—the design direction is not rational from a scientific transparency/cost viewpoint.

## Advice

Avoid for fidelity-focused use. For the same **power-distribution** function, buy a basic, safety-featured strip like the **Hyper Tough 6-Outlet 900 J** for a tiny fraction of the cost and allocate savings toward components with proven, measured impact (speakers, room treatment, DAC/amp with transparent performance).
