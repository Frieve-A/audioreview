## Overview

Austrian Audio’s Hi-X15 is the entry point to the company’s Hi-X series, carrying the same 44 mm Hi-X (High Excursion) dynamic driver concept used in higher tiers. Official pricing is 99 USD and the model targets studio monitoring and general critical listening at a budget level [1]. As of August 13, 2025, publicly available independent measurements (full-band frequency response curves, THD vs SPL) specific to Hi-X15 are limited; this review therefore treats manufacturer specifications as provisional evidence and contrasts them with measured data from competing models where appropriate [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Key manufacturer specifications: frequency range 12 Hz–24 kHz, sensitivity 113 dB SPL/V, impedance 25 Ω, maximum input 150 mW [1][2]. These figures meet or exceed basic requirements for wired closed-back monitoring headphones; however, third-party lab data for Hi-X15 (e.g., frequency-response deviation vs a neutral target, harmonic distortion at 94 / 104 dB SPL, isolation in dB) were not found at publication. In line with the policy, the score defaults to 0.5 in the absence of verified measurements and will be updated when credible independent data become available [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Hi-X15 employs Austrian Audio’s 44 mm Hi-X driver and ring-magnet architecture used across the series, with a copper-clad aluminum voice coil to reduce moving mass. The design choices are technically sound and consistent with modern studio headphones but are not groundbreaking on their own. Build highlights include a foldable, closed-back platform with detachable cable [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Prices (US market, current):**  
- Review target, Hi-X15: 99 USD [1].  
- Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (measured): **AKG K361**, 89 USD at Guitar Center (new, current listing) [3].

**Why K361 qualifies:** RTINGS reports strong target compliance (Mid-range RMS deviation 0.74 dB; Bass RMS deviation 2.5 dB), low measured harmonic distortion at both 94 dB and 104 dB SPL, and closed-back, wired functionality comparable to Hi-X15 [4]. These results indicate at least equivalent, and in FR accuracy likely better, measurement-backed performance than the unmeasured Hi-X15.

**Calculation:** 89 USD ÷ 99 USD = **0.90** → rounded to **0.9** per policy.  
(*If future independent measurements show Hi-X15 outperforming K361 across FR/THD/isolation, this CP score will be revisited.*)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Austrian Audio is an established pro-audio firm, and the Hi-X15 uses a practical foldable/mechanical design. That said, there is no widely published field-failure dataset or exceptional warranty program specific to this model. Overall, support expectations align with industry average [1][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A pragmatic, studio-oriented closed-back design with easy drivability (25 Ω, high sensitivity) is rational. Without independent verification of neutrality or distortion, the design intent cannot be fully validated against transparent-level measurement targets, hence a mid-tier score.

## Advice

If you require **measurement-verified neutrality on a tight budget**, prioritize the AKG K361 given its documented target compliance and low distortion at a currently lower price [3][4]. If you value the Hi-X series construction and ecosystem and can accept the present lack of independent Hi-X15 lab data, the 99 USD pricing is competitive [1].
