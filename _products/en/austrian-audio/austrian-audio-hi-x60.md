rating: [3.0, 0.6, 0.8, 0.3, 0.7, 0.6]
price: 399
summary: "Professional closed-back headphones from former AKG engineers featuring advanced ring-magnet drivers; extremely low distortion but uneven stock tuning. Cost-performance is weak at 399 USD versus cheaper, measurement-comparable closed-back monitors such as AKG K361 (135 USD)."

## Overview

The Austrian Audio Hi-X60 is a closed-back studio monitor headphone developed by a Vienna team founded by ex-AKG engineers. It uses proprietary 44 mm high-excursion dynamic drivers with a ring-magnet motor and is assembled in Austria for professional tracking and monitoring.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent measurements show **very low distortion** but a stock frequency response that isn’t especially neutral. Audio Science Review’s lab tests report an uneven response with boosted bass and upper-band energy relative to the midrange [1]. DIY-Audio-Heaven likewise measures **exemplary low distortion** yet notes a bit of upper-mid/low-treble emphasis that can sound bright without EQ [2]. Manufacturer specs list THD (@1 kHz) < 0.1%, sensitivity 110 dB SPL/V, and 25 Ω impedance, aligning with the low-distortion results and easy drivability in practice [5].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The driver uses an advanced ring-magnet motor and a CCAW voice coil to reduce moving mass and improve transient response. The build (metal hinges/band, detachable cables) is robust and serviceable, consistent with professional use [5]. Overall, the acoustic/mechanical design reflects thoughtful engineering beyond commodity dynamics.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

To be a fair comparator, the alternative must be **functionally equivalent (closed-back studio use)** and **not inferior in measured performance**. The **AKG K361** fits: it’s a closed-back studio model with balanced tuning and **remarkable harmonic distortion performance** per RTINGS (clean at 94 and 104 dB SPL across the band) [3]. New-unit street price at a major retailer is **135 USD** [4].  
**CP calculation (USD):** 135 ÷ 399 ≈ **0.34** → rounds to **0.3**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Austrian Audio offers **up to 5-year warranty** with registration—above average for the category [5][7]. In January 2025, DPA Microphones acquired a majority stake in Austrian Audio, likely strengthening long-term corporate backing [6].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The company’s engineering-led emphasis yields genuinely low distortion and solid mechanics. However, the out-of-box tuning is not neutral; for accurate monitoring, EQ is advisable. Given that a much cheaper closed-back like the K361 meets functional needs and achieves low distortion with more neutral tonality, the 399 USD price is hard to justify on measured fidelity alone.

## Advice

Choose the Hi-X60 if you value Austrian manufacture, rugged serviceability, and **very low distortion**, and you plan to apply EQ. If you need neutral monitoring on a budget, the **AKG K361** provides more accurate tonality out of the box at a fraction of the price [3][4].
