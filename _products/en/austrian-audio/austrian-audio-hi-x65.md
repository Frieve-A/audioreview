## Overview

The Austrian Audio Hi-X65 are open-back professional headphones designed for mixing and mastering. Founded by former AKG engineers, Austrian Audio brings measurement-first engineering with a proprietary 44 mm dynamic driver and ring-magnet motor. The design prioritizes low distortion, practical 25 Ω impedance, and robust metal hinges and headband.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Manufacturer specs**: frequency range 5 Hz–28 kHz, sensitivity 110 dB SPL/V, impedance 25 Ω, THD < 0.1% at 1 kHz [3].  
**Third-party**: SoundStage’s lab shows very low distortion for a dynamic open-back, remaining under ~3% even at 20 Hz with 100 dB SPL, with benign behavior above the bass; the cumulative spectral decay also reveals a narrowband “hash” around 2.3–3.5 kHz. Sensitivity and impedance match the catalog values [1][2]. Frequency response is generally neutral-leaning but with treble lift above ~5 kHz and some mid irregularity, so it falls short of “transparent” neutrality. Overall, measured performance is solid but not class-leading.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 44 mm “Hi-X” high-excursion driver uses a ring magnet and CCAW voice coil to lower moving mass and improve transient response. The folding, metal-reinforced structure is robust and serviceable. These are thoughtful, modern implementations of established dynamic-driver practice rather than a fundamentally novel architecture.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Current market price (review target):** 314.33 USD (Amazon US, new) [4].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **Sennheiser HD 560S**, an open-back wired reference with near-neutral frequency response (GRAS 43AG measurements) and low distortion (spec < 0.05% at 1 kHz; independent labs corroborate neutral tuning) [5][6][7].

**Why equivalent-or-better:** Same core functions (open-back, wired studio monitoring). Third-party measurements show HD 560S tracks a neutral target closely and exhibits low distortion comparable to or better than the Hi-X65 for mixing/mastering work [6][7].

**Calculation:** 268.06 USD ÷ 314.33 USD = 0.8528 → **0.9** (rounded to one decimal). Prices are new, widely available retail as of the review date.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Build quality is above average for this class (metal yokes/hinges, detachable cables). Warranty/support are standard for pro brands; long-term fleet reliability data are still limited given the company’s relative youth, but materials and construction inspire confidence.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Design choices (low impedance for easy drive, emphasis on low distortion, serviceable construction) align with measurement-driven goals for professional monitoring without marketing gimmicks. Engineering trade-offs are coherent and user-oriented.

## Advice

If you want a neutral, open-back monitor and value lowest price for equivalent measured performance, start with the **Sennheiser HD 560S**. Choose the **Hi-X65** if you prefer its ergonomics/build and accept paying a bit more for broadly similar objective fidelity.
