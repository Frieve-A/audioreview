## Overview

The Austrian Audio OC818 is a multi-pattern large diaphragm condenser microphone developed by engineers from AKG Vienna. It features the CKR12 ceramic capsule, a modern redesign of the legendary CK12 capsule, and offers four selectable polar patterns (omnidirectional, cardioid, super-cardioid, and figure-8). The microphone handles maximum SPL of 148dB (158dB with pad) and features distinctive wireless control functionality through the optional OCR8 adapter.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The frequency response spans 20Hz-20kHz with a boost around 5kHz and presence enhancement around 12kHz (manufacturer specifications) [2]. Self-noise of 9dB SPL (A-weighted) and maximum SPL of 148dB (158dB with pad) represent excellent measured values [2]. Sensitivity of 13mV/Pa and nominal impedance of 275Ω are within appropriate ranges. Specific THD and IMD values are not published, and the availability of comprehensive third-party measurement data is limited, making this evaluation provisional based on manufacturer specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The handcrafted CKR12 ceramic capsule represents a technological achievement in modernizing the 1950-60s AKG CK12 capsule design. The adoption of edge-termination methodology and the dual output configuration using the main XLR and a 5-pin mini-XLR for independent recording of both diaphragms demonstrate high technical sophistication. The OCR8 wireless adapter and PolarPilot app provide distinctive wireless control for an analog professional microphone. The transformerless output design and per-unit measurement-based quality control indicate high technical standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Street price is around 1,300 USD. Per policy, when comparing across classes and topologies, we must use the world’s lowest-priced option that is not inferior in functions and measured performance (multi-pattern, independent diaphragm outputs enabling post-recording polar synthesis, low self-noise, high SPL handling). Among current systems meeting these criteria, representative options are generally priced higher than the OC818. Therefore, the ratio versus the least expensive truly non-inferior alternative is ≥1, leading to a better cost-performance assessment than initially stated.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Austrian Audio was founded by former AKG Vienna engineers with extensive product development experience. The CKR12 capsules are handcrafted with individual adjustment and tested through measurement systems. Firmware updates are not applicable for this product category. Industry-standard warranty and support systems are expected, though long-term reliability track record is still being established as a newer company.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The modern redesign of the CK12-style capsule is scientifically grounded and achieves measurable performance improvements. The dual output for independent diaphragm recording and wireless control functionality demonstrate a balanced approach between practicality and technological innovation. High SPL handling and low-noise design represent rational approaches toward achieving transparent level performance. However, differentiation elements from general recording equipment are somewhat limited for justifying existence as dedicated equipment.

## Advice

The OC818 is a high-quality microphone with excellent sound quality and innovative features, but faces cost-performance challenges. The equivalent-function sE4400 is available at approximately 40% of the price, so alternative consideration is recommended for cost-conscious users. However, if you value the CK12-style tonal characteristics and wireless control functionality, it represents a worthwhile investment. When considering it as an alternative to AKG C414 or Neumann U87, it offers sufficiently competitive sound quality performance.
