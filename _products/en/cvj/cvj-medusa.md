## Overview

CVJ Medusa is a 149 USD single dynamic-driver in-ear monitor featuring a 10 mm beryllium-plated diaphragm, dual magnets, dual chambers and a semi-open, CNC-machined aluminum shell [1]. The cable includes interchangeable 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm plugs, and the connector is 0.78 mm 2-pin [1]. CVJ positions Medusa as a flagship single-DD model in its range, distributed globally via Linsoul.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

There are currently **no credible third-party measurements** (FR/THD/IMD, isolation, etc.) published for Medusa. The product page lists only general claims such as “minimizes distortion” and “crystal-clear imaging” without numeric test data or conditions [1]. In the absence of independently verified FR deviation (±dB) across 20 Hz–20 kHz or distortion levels under typical IEM listening SPLs, Medusa’s audible transparency cannot be substantiated. Therefore the score is set below average pending independent lab data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A beryllium-plated diaphragm, dual-magnet motor and dual-chamber semi-open shell are established engineering approaches aimed at reducing breakup modes, improving control and managing internal pressure. Machined metal construction and the modular 3.5/4.4 mm cable are well executed for the price. However, none of these are category-leading innovations in 2025; similar implementations are common among peers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Current market price of Medusa:** 149 USD [1].  
Per our methodology, we select the **single cheapest equal-or-better alternative** by user-visible functions and measured performance across classes.

- **Comparator:** 7Hz x Crinacle **Zero:2** (detachable 2-pin IEM), **regular** 24.99 USD [3] **+** required **4.4 mm balanced 2-pin cable** (Tripowin Jelly) 32.39 USD [4] to normalize Medusa’s included balanced plug.  
- **Equivalence note:** Zero:2 provides the same core function (wired IEM playback with detachable 2-pin cable); third-party databases show **balanced, target-conforming FR** on B&K 5128/IEC60318-4 rigs, meeting or exceeding neutrality-focused baselines [5]. With measurements available for Zero:2 while Medusa has none, Zero:2 is judged **equal-or-better** on measured fidelity.

**CP calculation (USD):**  
(24.99 + 32.39) ÷ 149 = 0.385 → rounded to 0.4

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Distribution via Linsoul provides a **1-year warranty for IEMs** and **3-month warranty for cables/adapters** [7]. This is industry-average coverage. Long-term field reliability data specific to CVJ remains limited; service infrastructure is typical of Chinese direct-to-consumer brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Medusa’s materials and acoustic structures are directionally rational for improving control and comfort (semi-open pressure management). However, **non-publication of independent measurements** and reliance on marketing descriptors reduce confidence that the design is being validated against audibility-relevant metrics. The approach appears pragmatic but insufficiently measurement-driven in public documentation.

## Advice

If you prioritize **proven fidelity per measurement**, start with the **7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2** and add a basic 4.4 mm cable if needed; you’ll obtain target-conforming tonality at a fraction of Medusa’s price [3][4][5]. If you specifically want a metal shell and bundled 3.5/4.4 mm plugs, Medusa’s hardware bundle is attractive, but we recommend waiting for independent FR/THD data before purchase. Well-documented mid-priced alternatives also exist (e.g., TruthEar Nova), but those do not change the CP outcome because cheaper, measured-transparent options are available.
