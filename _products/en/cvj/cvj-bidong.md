## Overview

CVJ Bidong is a hybrid in-ear monitor featuring a 1DD+6BA configuration with CNC-machined aluminum-magnesium alloy shells and a modular cable bundle that includes 3.5 mm/2.5 mm/4.4 mm plugs and a USB-C plug with a built-in DAC. List price is 189 USD and the model is sold as a limited “Valentine’s Day Edition.” [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As of 2025-08-23, we could not locate publicly available third-party laboratory measurements (IEC-711/B&K 5128) for Bidong’s frequency response, THD, or isolation. Therefore, this section relies on manufacturer specifications only: impedance 28 Ω ±15 %, sensitivity 112 dB ±3 dB, stated response 10 Hz–40 kHz, and a USB-C plug using a CX31993-based DAC. These are catalog specs rather than independently verified data. Provisional baseline score is set accordingly. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 1DD+6BA hybrid topology with a three-way electronic+acoustic crossover, 3D-machined shells, and a modular termination system demonstrates a solid engineering package. The included USB-C digital plug covers smartphone use without an external dongle, and interchangeable balanced plugs extend device compatibility. These are modern and rational design choices for feature coverage. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

To normalize functions (balanced outputs + USB-C DAC) and judge only by specs and measured performance, the cheapest combination we identified that is **not inferior in functions** and has **credible third-party measurements** is:

- **SIMGOT EW200** IEM (independent 711 FR databases available) — 40.50 USD. [4][5]  
- **Tripowin Amber** modular 3-in-1 cable (3.5 mm/2.5 mm/4.4 mm) — 26.99 USD. [6]  
- **FiiO KA11** USB-C DAC dongle — 36.99 USD. [7]

Total comparator price: **104.48 USD**.  
CP calculation (review target price as denominator): **104.48 ÷ 189 = 0.5528… → 0.6** (rounded to one decimal). [4][5][6][7]

Notes on “measured performance”: EW200 has publicly accessible IEC-60318-4 (711) frequency-response data and is widely documented to follow contemporary neutral/Harman-type targets; this meets the requirement to base comparison on specs and measurements across classes/configurations. [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Build quality appears robust given the metal shells and detachable cable. Formal long-term failure-rate data or extended warranty provisions are not published. The modular system adds user flexibility but introduces additional connectors as potential failure points. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Bundling a balanced-capable modular cable and a USB-C DAC plug is a practical, user-centric approach. However, without independently published measurements demonstrating transparent response or low distortion, it is unclear whether the complex 1DD+6BA implementation yields verifiable audible advantages versus simpler, well-measured designs. The concept is sound; public data disclosure is the missing piece. [1][2][4][5]

## Advice

If you specifically want a single-box kit with **both** balanced terminations and a USB-C digital plug in the box, Bidong is convenient. If you prioritize **measurement-backed fidelity per dollar**, a modular route (EW200 + Amber cable + KA11) provides equivalent functions and documented FR behavior at a substantially lower combined price. For further context on modern SIMGOT tunings with published measurement practices, see EM6L’s IEC-711-based review. [4][5][6][7][3]
