## Overview

CVJ Freedom is a five-driver hybrid in-ear monitor combining one dynamic driver with four balanced armatures and two tuning switches that offer four modes. It includes a modular cable with 2.5 mm, 3.5 mm, and 4.4 mm terminations. The current market price is 80 USD. All of these are manufacturer-published specifications. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications: 22 Ω impedance, 113 dB ± 3 dB sensitivity, and 20 Hz–20 kHz frequency response. [1] Independent lab-grade measurements (THD, IMD, crosstalk, dynamic range) are not available as of the review date. Community measurements indicate the two switch banks primarily affect the upper treble with small changes between 1DD+1BA vs 1DD+3BA and likewise 1DD+2BA vs 1DD+4BA, but these were obtained on a clone coupler and should be considered provisional. [2] With no robust third-party evidence for transparency-level performance, the score defaults to the policy midpoint and remains 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The 1DD+4BA hybrid array with electronic switches that enable 1DD+1/2/3/4 BA configurations is technically competent but conventional. The bundled modular cable is practical, yet there is no indication of unique crossover, acoustic, or patent-backed innovation beyond typical multi-driver practice. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Price basis (review target): 80 USD. [1]  
Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator (single product): **7Hz Salnotes Zero** — single dynamic driver IEM with third-party measurements showing target-adherent frequency response and low distortion suitable for audibility thresholds; typical market price **22 USD**. [3]

**Equivalence note:** Provides the same core function (wired IEM), with independent measurements indicating equal-or-better adherence to neutral targets and low THD for most listening use-cases. [3]

Simple division for CP (no clamping): **22 USD ÷ 80 USD = 0.275 → 0.3** (rounded to one decimal place).

For readers seeking a same-price foil, **Moondrop Aria** remains available around 80 USD and is widely documented with stable performance, but it is not the cheapest equivalent-or-better option and thus is not used for CP scoring. [4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

CVJ operates in the budget IEM segment with typical one-year distributor-backed warranty paths. Freedom’s detachable two-pin cable aids serviceability of common failures; however, the added switch hardware increases potential failure points versus simpler designs. No MTBF or large-sample RMA data is published. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Emphasis on driver count and switchable voicings targets preference variance more than measurable fidelity gains. Without independent evidence that the multi-BA switch matrix yields audible transparency improvements over a well-executed single dynamic driver, the approach reads as spec-driven rather than measurement-driven. [1][2]

## Advice

If you specifically want a hybrid with tuning switches, Freedom delivers that feature set. For strict fidelity per dollar, **7Hz Salnotes Zero** offers comparable real-world performance at a far lower price. [3] If you prefer to stay near 80 USD with a broadly validated baseline, **Moondrop Aria** is a proven single-driver alternative with extensive third-party coverage. [4]
