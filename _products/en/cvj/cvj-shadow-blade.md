## Overview

The CVJ Shadow Blade is a gaming-focused in-ear monitor that combines a 10 mm dynamic driver with a dedicated vibration unit. Priced at USD 79, it targets users who want tactile feedback alongside sound. Notable user-facing features include three interchangeable tuning tubes and a detachable microphone; core catalog specs list 20 Hz–20 kHz response, 8 Ω impedance, and 101 dB sensitivity (manufacturer) [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are currently no credible third-party laboratory measurements (e.g., FR deviation, THD/IMD, passive isolation) for the Shadow Blade. Manufacturer-stated figures (20 Hz–20 kHz, 8 Ω, 101 dB) are available but unverified [1]. The internal vibration unit is intended for immersion rather than transparency, and we found no evidence that it improves fidelity metrics relative to conventional IEMs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

User-facing engineering includes the dual-driver (dynamic + vibration) architecture, three metal tuning tubes, a detachable mic, and a zinc-alloy shell [1]. However, the vibration system is a simple audio-signal-driven haptic mechanism and does not reflect advances that typically improve measured transparency. With no third-party validations of acoustic performance, we assess the tech level as below average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better functionality): TRN Mars (with detachable mic and internal vibration unit).** Linsoul lists TRN Mars at **USD 54.99** for the 1.2 m version [2]. TRN's official page specifies an internal vibration unit, detachable mic, 20 Hz–20 kHz response, 8 Ω impedance, and 118 dB sensitivity (manufacturer) [3].  
**Equivalence note:** Both are wired IEMs with an internal vibration unit and detachable mic; basic catalog specs (FR range, impedance) are comparable, and Mars's sensitivity is higher (manufacturer).  
**Calculation (explicit):** 54.99 USD ÷ 79 USD = **0.70** → CP score **0.7**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

CVJ is a relatively new brand (reported founded in 2019) [5]. The Shadow Blade is sold via authorized distributors that advertise a one-year warranty coverage for such products [1]. Long-term field-failure data and service quality indicators are limited. The added mechanical complexity of a vibration unit may affect longevity, but there is insufficient data to quantify this risk. We place reliability/support at the category average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product prioritizes immersion and entertainment (tactile feedback, tuning tubes) over fidelity targets. This is a valid niche choice for gaming, yet it offers no demonstrated pathway to transparency in standard headphone metrics. No overt pseudo-science was identified; thus the design philosophy lands at average rationality.

## Advice

Choose the Shadow Blade if your primary goal is **tactile immersion** for games and movies with a wired IEM form factor. If you instead want **measured accuracy under USD 100**, options like the Truthear HEXA have independent lab data showing very good reproduction accuracy and are commonly available around USD 79.99 [4][6]. For competitive play where positional audio clarity matters more than haptics, a measurement-backed IEM is the safer pick.
