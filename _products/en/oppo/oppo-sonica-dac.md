## Overview

The OPPO Sonica DAC was a premium network streaming DAC released in 2017 featuring the flagship ESS ES9038PRO SABRE chip with comprehensive format support including PCM up to 32-bit/768kHz and DSD512. Originally priced at 799 USD, this fully balanced design incorporated a toroidal linear power supply and app-based control system. OPPO Digital discontinued operations in 2018, making the Sonica increasingly sought after by collectors while limiting long-term support availability.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Measured performance significantly exceeds transparent thresholds across all key specifications. THD+N achieves -115 dB (less than 0.01%), while S/N ratio and dynamic range both exceed 120 dB. Channel separation surpasses 120 dB, and frequency response measures 20 Hz - 20 kHz (+0/-0.04 dB). Archimago's independent measurements validated transparent performance with routinely achieved SINAD exceeding 100 dB [2]. All measurements demonstrate world-class performance levels well into the transparent range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Implementation centers around the industry-standard ESS ES9038PRO chipset, which represented cutting-edge technology in 2017. The fully balanced audio path from DAC chip to XLR outputs demonstrates competent engineering, complemented by a quality toroidal linear power supply. Network streaming integration and comprehensive format support reflect appropriate contemporary technology adoption. However, the design primarily utilizes off-the-shelf components without significant proprietary innovations or breakthrough technical achievements beyond industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a discontinued networkable DAC/streamer with balanced XLR outputs, a proper like-for-like benchmark is the **Matrix Audio mini-i 4** (current street price **649 USD**). It matches/exceeds Sonica’s core functionality (network streaming, XLR balanced line outs, PCM768/DSD512, MQA) and publishes strong measurements (**XLR SNR 127 dB A-wt; THD+N < 0.00015%**). Under this condition, the **Cost-Performance ratio is 0.81**, reflecting that an equal-or-better performer is available at meaningfully lower cost. Accordingly, the Cost-Performance score is set to **0.4/1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

OPPO Digital's 2018 discontinuation significantly impacts long-term support despite the company's commitment to continued warranty and repair services [3]. The robust linear power supply design with minimal moving parts inherently reduces potential failure points. However, the discontinued status eliminates firmware updates and limits future parts availability. While existing warranty commitments remain honored, the absence of ongoing product development and reduced manufacturer presence creates uncertainty for long-term ownership.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

OPPO Digital demonstrated exemplary measurement-driven design philosophy prioritizing technical excellence and transparency. Their stated goal of creating "transparent gear that will not impart its own sound" aligns with rational audio engineering principles [4]. The engineering approach emphasized objective performance verification over subjective claims, with rigorous attention to technical specifications. The high-quality linear power supply and balanced architecture contribute directly to measured performance improvements, representing rational cost allocation toward audible benefits.

## Advice

If you want Sonica’s **feature set** today (network streaming + balanced outputs) with excellent objective performance and active support, the **Matrix Audio mini-i 4** is an appropriate modern alternative at a substantially lower price. The Sonica remains a fine performer, but purchase mainly makes sense for collection purposes or at a steep discount on the used market.
