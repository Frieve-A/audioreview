## Overview

The Chord Electronics Mojo 2 launched in **2022** as the successor to the original Mojo. It keeps Chord’s proprietary FPGA DAC with a **40,960-tap WTA filter**, adds a **bit-perfect “UHD DSP”** tone system with crossfeed, and introduces an improved power system including **Intelligent Desktop Mode** for battery-friendly 24/7 use. [2][3][8]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent measurements show **transparent-class** performance. Using an APx555-grade rig, results include **Dynamic Range (AES17) 117.7 dB** and **SNR 118.8 dB**, with **~4.3 V** maximum before clipping and exemplary jitter behavior. The long-tap reconstruction filter fully resolves to the **22.05 kHz** Nyquist region with strong ultrasonic attenuation; HF THD rises mildly yet remains below audibility in normal use. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Mojo 2 is a **fully in-house FPGA DAC** with long-tap WTA filtering and a **104-bit, 705/768 kHz DSP** implementing **lossless** tone control and crossfeed. Engineering depth, algorithmic sophistication, and longevity of know-how are clear strengths. It falls just short of a perfect score because the portable DAC category is now mature and, while advanced, Mojo 2’s 2022-era approach doesn’t newly expand capabilities in 2025 beyond rivals that already reach transparent performance at lower cost. [2][8]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Current market price is **650 USD**. The cheapest product with **equal-or-better user functions and transparent-class measurements** we could confirm is **TOPPING G5 at 299 USD** (adds LDAC Bluetooth, **4.4 mm balanced out**, and line-in; published specs/third-party data show **SNR ~124 dB**, **THD+N ≤0.0001%** on line out). **CP: 299 ÷ 650 = 0.46 → 0.5.** [3][4][5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The CNC-aluminum chassis and conservative thermal design inspire confidence. Chord’s **portable warranty is 1 year**, shorter than some peers. Battery life is **about 8+ hours**, and **Intelligent Desktop Mode** mitigates wear during continuous powered use. [2][7][8]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design prioritizes **measurement-first** fidelity: long-tap filtering to minimize imaging error, robust clocking/jitter control, and **bit-perfect on-device DSP** for practical EQ and crossfeed. Clear progression over the original Mojo is observed. It stops short of **price disruption**, since comparably transparent performance is achievable for substantially less outlay, but the approach remains technically coherent and user-oriented. [1][2][3]

## Advice

Choose Mojo 2 if you want a compact, **wired-first** DAC/amp with state-of-the-art reconstruction filtering, very low noise/jitter, and on-device EQ/crossfeed. If you need **wireless, balanced output**, or simply the **lowest cost for transparent performance**, the **TOPPING G5** is the stronger value at less than half the price. [4][6]
