## Overview

The Chord Electronics Hugo 2 is a British-made portable DAC/headphone amplifier released in 2017. It features the company's proprietary FPGA technology with a 49,152-tap digital filter, achieving what was, at the time, advanced processing power. It is positioned as an ambitious product pursuing desktop-level sound quality in a portable design. Although it is still sold as a current product more than seven years after its launch, its value should be judged soberly against current technological standards and market conditions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance of the Hugo 2 meets the "transparent" level criteria in many respects. With a THD+N of less than 0.0001%, an S/N ratio of 126 dB, and crosstalk of 135 dB, it significantly clears the transparent levels in our reference table. The frequency response is also extremely flat at ±0.2 dB across the 20Hz-20kHz range. The output impedance is exceptionally low at 0.025Ω, allowing it to maximize the performance of any connected headphones. Objective measurements by third-party organizations also confirm its excellent distortion characteristics, especially in real-world use with headphones, verifying its high fidelity from a scientific standpoint.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 49,152-tap digital filter (WTA filter) using a Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA was groundbreaking technology in 2017. Its unique design, which sets it apart from common off-the-shelf DAC chips, combined with the pulse array DAC and Class A output stage, is technically innovative. However, more than seven years have passed since its release, and it is now possible to achieve equivalent or better measurement performance at a lower cost using general-purpose chips. The technology, once top-tier in the industry, has lost its cutting-edge appeal from a current perspective. While it remains an example of the company's technical potential, it has lost its absolute superiority.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Against the Hugo 2's current market price of approximately 2,175 USD, the Topping G5, which offers equivalent or superior measurement performance, is available for about 300 USD. The Topping G5, like the Hugo 2, is a portable DAC/amp with a built-in battery, yet it demonstrates performance equal to or better than the Hugo 2 in key metrics like SINAD (Signal-to-noise and distortion ratio). Since the core value offered to the user (high-fidelity portable playback) can be achieved for less than one-eighth of the price, the cost-performance of the Hugo 2 must be rated as extremely low. The calculation is "300 USD ÷ 2,175 USD ≈ 0.14," resulting in a score of 0.1.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Chord Electronics, founded in 1989, is a British manufacturer with a long track record in the high-end audio field. The Hugo 2 has been sold continuously for a long period, suggesting high product stability. The precision-machined aluminum chassis is robust, and the warranty and repair support systems are at an industry-standard level. However, as a portable device, the aging of the internal battery and its replacement process are long-term concerns.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design philosophy of the Hugo 2, which emphasizes improvements in measurable performance, is fundamentally rational as a scientific approach. However, the lack of rationality lies in offering this outcome in an extremely expensive, dedicated device. As products like the Topping G5 demonstrate, the current reality is that equivalent or better performance can be achieved at a significantly lower cost using more common technologies and production methods. The high-cost, hardware-centric approach to which the Hugo 2 adheres has lost its necessity in the current market. The stance of continuing to sell a legacy product at a high price without reflecting technological progress is difficult to call a rational design philosophy.

## Advice

While the Hugo 2 is an excellent product in terms of measured performance when viewed in isolation, a new purchase is not recommended at all in the current market. The fact that products like the Topping G5 exist with equivalent or better audio performance at less than one-eighth the price is a critically important factor to consider. With a budget of 2,175 USD, you could build a far superior system, such as a high-performance desktop DAC and headphone amplifier combination or a system including a feature-rich network streamer, which would provide much greater satisfaction. While existing owners may find it worthwhile to continue using their device, for those looking to improve their portable setup, we strongly recommend considering more modern and cost-effective alternatives.
