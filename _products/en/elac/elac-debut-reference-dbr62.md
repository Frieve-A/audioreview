## Overview

The ELAC Debut Reference DBR62 is a 6.5-inch 2-way bookshelf speaker designed by renowned speaker engineer Andrew Jones. Combining an aramid fiber cone woofer with a silk dome tweeter, it achieves wideband reproduction from 44Hz to 35kHz. Significant improvements have been made from the original Debut series, including cast aluminum chassis and reinforcement bracing, aimed at enhancing measured performance and suppressing resonance. It represents ELAC's technical achievement in the mid-price range category.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

According to measurement data, the frequency response falls within ±3dB from 44Hz-35kHz, showing good characteristics for a speaker. The 6Ω, 86dB specifications are standard, though consideration for amplifier matching is necessary. The aramid fiber woofer's damping characteristics and silk dome tweeter's smooth high-frequency reproduction keep measured distortion characteristics at good levels. The newly designed waveguide improves directivity control, contributing to acoustic characteristic stability in listening environments. However, the 86dB sensitivity is somewhat low for modern speakers, requiring high-output amplifiers for high-volume reproduction.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Based on Andrew Jones' design philosophy, the combination of aramid fiber cone woofer and cast aluminum chassis achieves clear technical improvements from the conventional Debut series. The newly designed waveguide brings practical improvements in directivity control, and cabinet reinforcement bracing is effective for resonance suppression. However, the basic design approach remains an extension of conventional 2-way speakers, with limited innovative technical elements. Compared to competing products in the same price range, technical superiority remains partial, and while above industry standard levels, no groundbreaking technical innovations are observed.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Against the 480 USD price point, the existence of the KEF Q150 (350 USD) with equivalent functionality and measured performance limits cost-performance. Calculation: 350 USD ÷ 480 USD = 0.73. The KEF Q150 has 51Hz-28kHz frequency response and 86dB sensitivity, achieving superior sound imaging through Uni-Q driver technology. While the DBR62 has technical differences such as low-frequency extension to 44Hz and aramid fiber woofer adoption, these don't provide practical differences significant enough for users. With multiple more affordable options offering equivalent or superior performance, including the Wharfedale Diamond 12.2 (approximately 450 USD) and Monitor Audio Bronze 100 (approximately 500 USD), price competitiveness is weak.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

ELAC, as a German veteran acoustic manufacturer founded in 1926, maintains long-term product support systems. Product warranties are set for industry-standard periods, and after-sales service is provided through authorized dealers domestically. The Andrew Jones-designed Debut series has extensive market track record, with stable systems expected for parts supply and repair support. However, compared to emerging manufacturers, innovative support such as advanced firmware updates is not provided, remaining within conventional hardware-centered support systems. The product's physical construction is solid, with reliability for long-term use at high levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Andrew Jones' design philosophy focuses on measured performance improvement and pursuit of acoustic neutrality, which is rational as a scientific approach. The adoption of aramid fiber woofer and cast aluminum chassis is appropriate as technical solutions for clear goals of resonance suppression and distortion reduction. Directivity control through waveguides addresses practical issues of acoustic characteristic stabilization in listening environments. All improvements from the original Debut series connect to measurable performance improvements, eliminating marketing decorative elements. However, questions remain about the rationality of existence as dedicated audio equipment, given the presence of more affordable options with equivalent measured performance.

## Advice

The ELAC Debut Reference DBR62 is a bookshelf speaker with solid technical approach and good measured performance designed by Andrew Jones. However, the 480 USD price point fails to show clear superiority compared to competing products with equivalent or superior performance, such as the KEF Q150 (350 USD) or Wharfedale Diamond 12.2 (approximately 450 USD). For those considering purchase, we recommend first auditioning the KEF Q150 and choosing the DBR62 only if there are specific reasons for dissatisfaction with its sound quality. It becomes an option for those who find special value in trust for the Andrew Jones brand or sound quality characteristics from the aramid fiber woofer, but for those prioritizing pure cost-performance, other options should be prioritized. When selecting amplifiers, consideration of the 86dB sensitivity is important, requiring pairing with amplifiers having sufficient output.
