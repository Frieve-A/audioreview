## Overview

The ELAC Cinema Pipe is a discontinued slender floorstanding speaker designed by renowned engineer Andrew Jones. Originally priced at £639 (800 USD), this 2½-way closed design features four 80mm cone drivers and a 25mm dome tweeter in a distinctive brushed aluminum enclosure measuring 900×88×102mm. The Cinema Pipe was designed for home theater applications with magnetically shielded drivers for TV compatibility and includes a glass plinth for stability. Currently available in the used market for approximately 200 USD per pair, the Cinema Pipe shows reasonable value despite limitations in frequency response range compared to modern alternatives.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ELAC Cinema Pipe faces significant limitations in scientific validity due to insufficient measurement data and problematic frequency response specifications. The manufacturer-specified frequency response of 80Hz-21kHz falls considerably short of the ideal 20Hz-20kHz full audible range, with the 80Hz low-frequency limit indicating limited bass performance [1]. Critical measurements including THD, S/N ratio, dynamic range, and intermodulation distortion are not available for evaluation. The 89dB/2.83V/1m sensitivity is adequate but unremarkable, while the 6-ohm nominal impedance (4.8 ohms minimum at 400Hz) provides reasonable amplifier compatibility. Without third-party measurement verification and with key performance metrics missing, the Cinema Pipe cannot demonstrate transparent-level performance required for high scientific validity scoring.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Cinema Pipe represents conventional speaker technology with limited innovation beyond Andrew Jones' established design expertise. Positive factors include Jones' in-house design approach and his well-documented measurement-based methodology developed during his tenure at KEF, where he emphasized accurate measurement techniques as fundamental to proper speaker development [2]. The 2½-way configuration with magnetically shielded drivers demonstrates competent engineering for TV-adjacent installation. However, the design relies entirely on analog/mechanical technology without modern digital integration, software enhancement, or advanced materials. The conventional cone and dome driver technology offers no significant competitive advantage and can be easily replicated by other manufacturers. While Jones brings technical credibility to the design, the Cinema Pipe's implementation represents mature technology rather than cutting-edge innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The ELAC Cinema Pipe current used market price is 200 USD per pair, making cost-performance evaluation against equivalent alternatives essential. Equipped with floorstanding design, magnetic shielding, and 80Hz-21kHz frequency response, the Polk T50 at approximately 190 USD per pair provides equivalent-or-better performance with significantly superior 38Hz-24kHz frequency response range, 90dB sensitivity (vs 89dB), matching 6-ohm impedance, and higher power handling capability (25-200W vs 20-150W) [3]. CP = 190 ÷ 200 = 0.95, rounded to 1.0. Despite the Polk T50's substantially better low-frequency extension (38Hz vs 80Hz), higher sensitivity, and greater power handling capability, the Cinema Pipe achieves maximum cost-performance scoring due to comparable pricing. The Cinema Pipe shows reasonable value in the discontinued speaker market though with clear performance disadvantages compared to modern alternatives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

ELAC provides comprehensive warranty coverage with 3 years for passive speakers, above-average industry standard [4]. The simple cone and dome driver construction offers inherent robustness with fewer failure-prone components compared to complex multi-way designs. ELAC's 90+ year history in audio manufacturing and global support infrastructure provide reasonable confidence in long-term parts availability and repair services. However, customer service quality reports indicate significant communication issues, with forum users reporting weeks between responses from technical support [5]. Some mechanical failure reports suggest potential spider separation problems affecting woofer performance. The combination of solid warranty terms and robust construction is offset by documented customer service deficiencies, resulting in above-average but not exceptional reliability scoring.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Andrew Jones brings scientifically sound measurement-based design philosophy to ELAC, emphasizing accurate measurement techniques as fundamental to proper speaker development [2]. This approach aligns with rational engineering principles and represents a positive foundation for product development. However, the Cinema Pipe's execution demonstrates poor translation of sound design principles into market-competitive results. The original 800 USD price point for conventional cone/dome technology without clear performance advantages indicated suboptimal cost-effectiveness decisions. The purely analog/mechanical approach ignores modern digital integration opportunities that could enhance functionality or reduce costs. The limited frequency response suggests design compromises that result in inferior performance compared to significantly cheaper alternatives, indicating irrational market positioning despite sound underlying engineering philosophy.

## Advice

The ELAC Cinema Pipe shows reasonable cost-performance for a discontinued product at current used market pricing but limited technical advantages over modern alternatives. Prospective buyers seeking floorstanding speakers should consider the Polk T50 at approximately 190 USD per pair, which provides superior frequency response (38Hz-24kHz vs 80Hz-21kHz) with higher sensitivity (90dB vs 89dB) and equivalent impedance characteristics at comparable cost. For those specifically interested in Andrew Jones designs, his more recent ELAC Debut series offers better value propositions with contemporary pricing and superior performance. The Cinema Pipe's discontinued status and limited bass extension make it suitable primarily for collectors or users specifically requiring the magnetically shielded design for TV-adjacent placement, with awareness of its technical limitations compared to modern alternatives.
