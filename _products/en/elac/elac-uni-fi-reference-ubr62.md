## Overview

The ELAC Uni-Fi Reference UBR62 is a 3-way bookshelf speaker featuring Andrew Jones's signature concentric driver design. The speaker combines a 1-inch soft dome tweeter integrated within a 4-inch aluminum midrange driver, paired with a 6.5-inch aluminum woofer. Key specifications include 41Hz-35kHz frequency response, 6Ω nominal impedance, 85 dB sensitivity, and 140W maximum power handling. The design incorporates cast chassis construction, compound curvature aluminum cones, dual flared slot ports, and full perimeter cabinet bracing. Andrew Jones, formerly of KEF and Pioneer, brings decades of engineering expertise to this Reference series implementation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Third-party measurements reveal mixed performance relative to audibility thresholds. Frequency response achieves ±3 dB from 80 Hz-20 kHz, meeting standard levels for the speaker category [1][2]. However, measured sensitivity of 83 dB falls below the manufacturer specification of 85 dB. Harmonic distortion shows moderate levels at 86 dB SPL with increased distortion at 96 dB. Dynamic compression becomes observable above 96 dB, indicating some performance limitations at higher output levels [1][2]. Impedance measurements show mostly 5Ω+ behavior with 4Ω dips at 50 Hz, within acceptable ranges. Overall measured performance places the UBR62 at average levels between problematic and transparent thresholds, with no significant advantages over reference standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The UBR62 demonstrates sophisticated engineering implementation through Andrew Jones's in-house concentric driver design. Key technologies include neodymium magnets enabling the tweeter-within-midrange configuration, cast chassis construction for improved stiffness and reduced resonances, and compound curvature aluminum cone geometry. The true 3-way crossover operates at 260Hz and 1800Hz frequencies. Advanced port design features dual flared slot geometry for optimized airflow. Full perimeter cabinet bracing adds structural integrity. The concentric driver represents meaningful technical advancement, particularly the integration challenges solved through neodymium magnet miniaturization. Andrew Jones's accumulated expertise from KEF and other manufacturers contributes significant know-how to the implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Current market price: 999.98 USD. Comprehensive analysis identified the KEF Q150 at 349.99 USD as comparison target. Equipped with concentric driver technology, and sensitivity and harmonic distortion measurements are equivalent-or-better. The Q150 provides 2-way Uni-Q concentric configuration with 86 dB measured sensitivity (vs 83 dB), 8Ω nominal impedance (vs 6Ω), and superior harmonic distortion performance at equivalent SPLs [3]. While the UBR62 offers true 3-way design advantages, the Q150's better measured performance at significantly lower cost demonstrates substantial cost-performance disadvantage. CP = 349.99 USD ÷ 999.98 USD = 0.3.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ELAC provides above-average support infrastructure with 3-year warranty for passive speakers, exceeding typical 2-year industry standard [4]. Warranty coverage applies to US and Canada purchases from authorized dealers. Direct manufacturer support available through ELAC America. Construction design suggests inherent reliability through cast chassis implementation and robust CARB2-rated MDF cabinet construction. Full perimeter bracing adds structural durability. Warranty requires proof of purchase and excludes modifications, abuse, or serial number removal. Company maintains established track record in audio industry. Support infrastructure covers replacement with equal/greater value units when exact models unavailable.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Andrew Jones employs measurement-driven design methodology with cyclical processes of prototype development, measurement, listening evaluation, and refinement [5]. However, his explicit characterization of speaker design as "a mix of art and science" indicates reliance on subjective evaluation alongside objective measurements. While Jones emphasizes measurement importance and adherence to international specifications, his acknowledgment that "measurements alone are insufficient" suggests balanced rather than purely scientific approaches. Cost-effectiveness philosophy focuses on "great sound at a reasonable price" and accessibility goals. Technology integration appropriately combines advanced elements (concentric drivers, neodymium magnets, cast chassis) with practical implementation. The framework favors purely measurement-focused approaches, placing this mixed methodology at baseline levels.

## Advice

The UBR62 targets audiophiles seeking Andrew Jones engineering with concentric driver technology in 3-way bookshelf format. Consider this speaker when prioritizing sophisticated driver integration and established designer pedigree over measured performance optimization. The 83 dB measured sensitivity requires powerful amplification for optimal dynamics. Room treatment may be necessary to manage potential treble brightness in smaller spaces. However, the significant cost-performance disadvantage versus alternatives like the KEF Q150 requires careful consideration. Most users seeking concentric driver benefits will find better value in lower-priced implementations offering superior measured performance. Recommended primarily for enthusiasts specifically valuing Andrew Jones design heritage and willing to accept performance compromises for that pedigree.
