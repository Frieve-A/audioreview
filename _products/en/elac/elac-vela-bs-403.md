## Overview

The Vela BS 403 is a 2-way, bass-reflex passive bookshelf speaker featuring ELAC’s handmade JET 5 Air Motion Transformer tweeter and a 150 mm AS-XR woofer in a distinctive trapezoid enclosure with a down-firing port. Manufacturer specs list 41 Hz–50 kHz response (no tolerance given), 86 dB sensitivity (2.83 V/1 m) and 4 Ω nominal impedance [2]. The original BS 403 has since been superseded by the BS403.2 (“Vela 2.0”) with the JET 6 tweeter, and the BS 403 is sold as a close-out or appears on the used market [7][8].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent Klippel NFS measurements (ANSI/CTA-2034) show a modest linearity ceiling for the BS 403: on the consolidated database the on-axis deviation is ~±2.25 dB over 300 Hz–5 kHz (4.5 dB span), with a predicted in-room preference score of 4.27 (6.6 with ideal sub integration) and –3 dB point near 60 Hz [1][3]. Erin’s test also documents a deliberate crossover-region notch/peak around ~2 kHz and low-to-average sensitivity—~84 dB measured vs 86 dB spec—which increases amplifier headroom demands [1]. Harmonic- and multitone-distortion plus dynamic-compression sweeps (70/79/87/96 dB @1 m and up to 102 dB) indicate rising compression at higher drive, improved when high-passed at 80 Hz [1]. Manufacturer FR bandwidth and nominal impedance are treated as ancillary specs [2]. Overall, audible transparency is constrained by integration/linearity rather than tweeter capability.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The JET 5 AMT offers wide HF extension and low distortion potential; the AS-XR aluminum/paper sandwich woofer, angled/trapezoid cabinet, and down-firing port reflect thoughtful mechanical/acoustic engineering [2]. However, system-level optimization (crossover/directivity smoothness) isn’t state-of-the-art by current best-measured standards. The successor BS403.2 migrating to JET 6 underscores iterative technical advancement [8].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Using a representative obtainable price for the BS 403 around **1600 USD** per pair (close-out/used listings) [6][7], the cheapest **equivalent-or-better** alternative we can verify today is **KEF Q350** at **499.99 USD/pair** direct from KEF USA [4]. It is a passive 2-way bookshelf speaker with equal user-facing functions and **superior measured linearity** (≈±1.3 dB over 300 Hz–5 kHz; preference score 5.57; –3 dB ≈68.8 Hz) [5].  
**499.99 ÷ 1600 = 0.31** → rounded to **0.3**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As a close-out/superseded model, long-term factory availability is limited; however, ELAC still lists the BS 403 on official channels and historically provides conventional parts/service for recent lines [2][7]. Passive design minimizes failure modes, and Erin’s summary relays a **3-year** warranty on the original model [1]. Net: average-to-good durability/support prospects for a passive speaker, tempered by end-of-line status.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

ELAC invests in genuinely technical elements (AMT tweeter, controlled cabinet geometry). Yet measured outcomes show integration trade-offs (crossover dip, directivity roughness) that cap audible transparency relative to leading data-driven designs [1][3]. The move to Vela 2.0 suggests a rational, measurement-guided iteration path [8].

## Advice

Buyers attracted by the Vela’s build and AMT attributes should plan on robust amplification (low-to-average sensitivity) and consider mild EQ to smooth the ~2 kHz region; an 80 Hz high-pass eases compression at high SPLs [1]. Value-focused readers will likely achieve equal-or-better measured performance for far less money from options like KEF’s Q350 [4][5]. If you prize the Vela’s design/tweeter and find a favorable close-out price with return support, it can be a satisfying choice—just set expectations around objective linearity vs today’s best-measured peers.
