## Overview

The ELAC Debut B5.2 is an entry-level 2-way bookshelf speaker from German heritage speaker manufacturer ELAC. Designed by Andrew Jones, it features a 1-inch soft dome tweeter and 5.25-inch aramid fiber woofer, claiming a frequency response of 46Hz-35kHz. The bass reflex MDF cabinet incorporates a 7-element custom crossover with 86dB sensitivity and 6Ω impedance. It is positioned as a model achieving hi-res compatibility at entry-level pricing.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Detailed measurements by Erin's Audio Corner have confirmed serious technical issues with this unit. High THD levels are measured in the midrange, and even with an 80Hz high-pass filter applied, audible levels of distortion remain at critical midrange frequencies. Furthermore, compression phenomena at high output levels are pronounced, limiting dynamic performance. While the frequency response is claimed to be 46-35kHz ±3dB, there is approximately a +3dB step around 1.5kHz that compromises acoustic balance. Compared to the speaker-specific modified criteria in the measurement standards table, THD approaches the problematic level (1%) and does not reach the transparent level (0.1% or below). Use without EQ correction is not recommended.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

In terms of design, the adoption of aramid fiber cones achieves higher rigidity and damping than typical polypropylene or paper cones. The soft dome tweeter with waveguide shows consideration for directivity control, and the adoption of a 7-element custom crossover is commendable. However, actual measured performance does not adequately reflect the design intent, indicating challenges in technical implementation. This represents a combination of industry-standard technologies without any outstanding proprietary technology. Based on measurement results, the technical potential has not been properly reflected in the final product.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Against the US market price of 379 USD, the Sony SS-CS5 with equivalent or superior functionality and measured performance is available for 200 USD. The SS-CS5 has a 3-way configuration with hi-res compatibility, 53Hz-50,000Hz claimed frequency response, and shows superior results in measured performance compared to this unit. Calculation: 200 USD ÷ 379 USD = 0.53. Rounded to 0.5. This unit significantly lacks price competitiveness as equivalent functionality exists at substantially lower prices.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

ELAC is a German heritage audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1926, with a long history and technical accumulation. Products come with standard warranty coverage, and domestic sales and support systems are established. No specific reliability issues have been reported, placing it above industry average levels. However, since this is not a product requiring firmware updates, long-term software support is not applicable for evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Based on measurement results, there are issues with design philosophy regarding the scientific goal of achieving transparent-level sound quality. High midrange distortion and frequency response inconsistencies indicate a lack of rationality in fundamental acoustic design. A design that assumes EQ correction means insufficient completeness as a standalone speaker. Output limitations also compromise practicality. While individual technologies like aramid fiber and waveguides are rational, the system as a whole does not constitute integrated design toward the goal of transparent acoustic reproduction.

## Advice

Those considering purchasing the ELAC Debut B5.2 are advised to make careful judgments based on measurement data. Due to high midrange distortion and frequency response issues, this unit cannot be expected to deliver satisfactory sound quality without EQ correction. It is suitable only for those with technical knowledge to perform EQ correction using digital signal processing equipment such as miniDSP. For general use, the Sony SS-CS5 (200 USD), which shows equivalent or superior measured performance, would be a more rational choice. The SS-CS5 has a 3-way configuration with claimed broader frequency response and achieves balanced acoustic characteristics without EQ correction. If budget permits, consideration of ELAC's own higher model, the B6.2, is also worthwhile. In audio equipment selection, it is important to prioritize objective measured performance over brand image.
