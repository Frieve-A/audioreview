## Overview

The ELAC Debut ConneX DCB61 is an active speaker system announced in 2025, featuring a 6.5-inch woofer and 1.9cm soft dome tweeter driven by 60W and 20W Class D amplifiers respectively. It offers versatile connectivity including HDMI ARC, Analog/Phono, Optical, USB, and Bluetooth inputs, with built-in Dolby Digital decoding for movie viewing. As the upper-tier model in the Debut ConneX series from established German manufacturer ELAC, it's priced at USD 899.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Official specifications claim frequency response of 48Hz-22kHz (-3dB), THD≤0.1%, and S/N ratio≥90dB. According to updated speaker measurement standards, the S/N ratio of 90dB meets the adequate threshold (80dB or above) for speaker applications. THD≤0.1% meets the excellent threshold for speaker systems, where physical acoustic reproduction constraints require different evaluation criteria compared to electronic components. The frequency response of 48Hz-22kHz provides adequate coverage for the audible spectrum, with the 48Hz lower limit representing reasonable performance for a 6.5-inch woofer system given physical constraints. While modern electronic DACs achieve superior measurements, speakers operate under different physical principles with inherent mechanical limitations. For speaker engineering standards, these specifications represent scientifically valid and measurable performance achievements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Employs a 6.5-inch polypropylene woofer and custom-designed waveguide tweeter, driven by Class D amplifiers (60W+20W). Features proprietary "S"-shaped rear-firing port and XBass Enhancer processing for low-frequency extension. However, these technologies represent combinations of existing solutions rather than innovative elements. The Class D amplifiers use generic solutions rather than in-house advanced technology. The design represents industry-standard level engineering.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

At USD 899, active speakers with equivalent functionality (6.5-inch driver, HDMI ARC, Bluetooth, phono input, USB connection, 80W class output) include KEF LSX II (USD 899) at the same price. LSX II offers 54Hz-28kHz, higher output, streaming functionality, MQA support and other advanced features. More affordable alternatives include Audioengine A5+ (USD 399) with 48Hz-22kHz, THD<0.05%, 150W output, but lacks HDMI ARC and phono input. The cheapest product with complete equivalent functionality is Q Acoustics M20 (USD 650). CP calculation: 650 USD ÷ 899 USD = 0.72, indicating moderate cost-performance levels.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

ELAC has established credibility as a German-based audio manufacturer founded in 1986. Product warranty is standard with established repair infrastructure. However, as active speakers, they carry inherent amplifier failure risks compared to passive speakers, presenting higher long-term operational risks. Firmware update support is provided, but frequency and support duration are not clearly specified.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The integration of diverse input terminals in an active speaker format, covering desktop to home theater applications, demonstrates highly commendable versatility. The design integrating HDMI ARC, phono input, Bluetooth, optical digital, and USB is practical and rational. Built-in DSP audio adjustment functionality, adequate low-frequency reproduction from 6.5-inch woofer, and Dolby Digital decoding support represent extremely rational design philosophy as an all-in-one solution. While price competitiveness presents challenges, the design philosophy from a feature integration perspective represents excellent engineering.

## Advice

If considering purchase, comparison with equivalent-function active speakers is essential. The Klipsch The Fives (USD 399) features 160W output, HDMI ARC, Bluetooth, and phono input, providing equivalent or superior functionality at approximately half the DCB61's price. The Kanto TUK (USD 499) offers HDMI ARC, Bluetooth, phono input, and 130W output with higher power output at approximately half price. For the best active speakers at USD 899 budget, the KEF LSX II (USD 899) provides equivalent pricing with streaming, HDMI ARC, MQA support, DSP processing, and more advanced features. Purchase of the DCB61 can only be justified when finding special value in ELAC's distinctive acoustic tuning or 6.5-inch driver sound characteristics.

## Additional Information

As active speakers, the DCB61 requires complete replacement in case of amplifier failure, which is a common constraint shared with other active speakers. The HDMI ARC functionality provides convenient TV audio system integration, but numerous competing products offer the same feature. While the 6.5-inch woofer provides physical advantages for low-frequency performance, the superiority is insufficient to justify the price differential.
