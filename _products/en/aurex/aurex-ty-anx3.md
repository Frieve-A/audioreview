## Overview
The Aurex TY-ANX3 is a slim vertical CD radio that integrates CD/AM/FM, Bluetooth **transmit & receive**, SD/USB, and study-friendly features. Playback supports FLAC/WAV (up to 96 kHz/24-bit), while **recording to SD/USB is MP3 only (up to 192 kbps)**. Bluetooth is **v5.3 with A2DP/AVRCP**, and A-B repeat plus 0.5–1.5× (11 steps) speed control are included[1]. Release date: **October 18, 2024**[2]. Current market price hovers around **98 USD**[3].

## Scientific Validity
$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$
No independent lab measurements are available. Manufacturer figures list **5.0 cm drivers**, output **2.2 W + 2.2 W** (BT playback) or **2.0 W + 2.0 W** (CD/SD/USB/LINE), and **MP3-only** recording to SD/USB[1]. Given the small sealed drivers and modest power, it is not designed to reach measurement “transparency”; hence a conservative **0.3** pending third-party data.

## Technology Level
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$
Solid integration of **BT 5.3 TX/RX**, SD/USB copy, **A-B repeat** and **speed control**, plus timer recording[1]. Playback capability advanced to FLAC/WAV, but recording remains MP3—which is a pragmatic choice at this price. No evidence of novel DSP or state-of-the-art acoustic breakthroughs; therefore **0.6**.

## Cost-Performance
$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$
**Result: CP = 1.0** because we **did not find any cheaper product** that matches or exceeds the full set of user-visible functions: CD/AM/FM + **BT TX/RX** + **digital recording to SD/USB** + **A-B repeat** + **speed control**.  
The older **TY-ANX2** is not cheaper (and lacks FLAC/WAV playback; BT-to-SD/USB recording is not featured as on TY-ANX3)[4][3]. The **Jensen CD-590** is cheaper in the US, but it lacks **digital SD/USB recording**, **BT transmit**, and **speed control**, so it cannot serve as an equivalent comparator[5]. With a street price around **98 USD**[3], TY-ANX3 stands as the cheapest option meeting the full requirement set.

## Reliability & Support
$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$
A straightforward CD-radio architecture (few moving parts beyond the CD mechanism) and AC/AA power options are positive[1]. We did not find explicit long-term warranty/firmware commitments—typical for this category—so we assign an average-plus **0.7** on structural simplicity.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy
$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$
Feature choices are purpose-driven: MP3 for convenient recording, robust playback compatibility (including FLAC/WAV), and strong study functions[1]. It does not chase transparent-level fidelity; instead, it prioritizes utility and cost control—reasonably **0.7**.

## Advice
If your priority is **language learning** (A-B, speed control) and flexible listening (BT TX/RX), this is an excellent pick. You can archive material to **SD/USB in MP3** directly from CD/radio/BT input[1]. For lossless archiving or high-output hi-fi playback, consider other solutions (external DAC/amp or higher-grade speakers/headphones).
