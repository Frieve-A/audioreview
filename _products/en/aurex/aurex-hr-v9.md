## Overview

The Aurex HR-V9 is a vintage back-electret stereo headphone from the Aurex brand (Toshiba's former luxury audio brand). Published sources disagree on release and discontinuation: Audio Heritage gives circa 1981 and list price ¥12,000 [3], while the HiFi Engine manual shows 1983 [1]. As part of Aurex's premium audio lineup, this model employed "back-electret" technology, where electret material is applied to the stators rather than the diaphragm itself [5]. Aurex served as Toshiba's high-end brand during the early 1980s, distinguishing premium audio devices from standard consumer electronics [2]. The HR-V9 featured conventional electronic engineering best practices applied carefully, though without particularly novel design elements. While historically significant for demonstrating early electret technology implementation, the model reflects the technical limitations and market constraints of its era.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Credible third-party measurements are unavailable for the HR-V9, and manufacturer-published specifications lack key audio-quality-relevant information: S/N ratio, dynamic range, crosstalk, and frequency-response deviation from a reference curve are not provided [1][3]. The available specifications (frequency response 20Hz–20kHz, THD 0.5% or below, sensitivity 107dB/3V, maximum sound pressure level 117dB [3]) are insufficient for a full evaluation against the measurement criteria. Given the data gaps, this criterion is scored 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The HR-V9 employs back-electret technology where electret material is coated on the stators with varying voltage applied to a normal polyester diaphragm [5]. While this approach represented sound engineering for the early 1980s, evaluation from current perspective reveals substantial technological limitations. The design demonstrates outdated technology adoption, utilizing mature decades-old electret approaches without contemporary advancement. The pure analog methodology lacks digital integration capabilities that characterize modern high-performance headphones. No significant accumulation of contemporary know-how is evident, and competitors can easily match or exceed performance using current technology. The 4000-ohm impedance design lacks competitive advantage, requiring specialized amplification without corresponding performance benefits [1][3]. The absence of DSP, software integration, or advanced materials prevents this vintage design from meeting current technology standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The HR-V9 provides wired over-ear listening with a 6.3mm plug and 3m cable and standard analog input (specs: 20Hz–20kHz, THD 0.5% or below, sensitivity 107dB/3V, maximum sound pressure level 117dB [3]). The comparison target is the world's cheapest product with equivalent-or-better user-facing functions and measured performance, regardless of driver type. The Superlux HD-681 EVO offers wired over-ear use, 3.5mm connection, and manufacturer specifications that meet or exceed the HR-V9's published performance (frequency response 10Hz–30kHz, 32Ω, 98dB SPL/1mW) [4]. Using 35 USD as a representative retail price for that model, CP = 35 ÷ 300 = 0.12, rounded to 0.1. This product's representative price is 300 USD (vintage/secondary market). No cheaper equivalent-or-better option was identified in the survey.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Current support infrastructure presents severe limitations. Toshiba has discontinued the product with no active support infrastructure [2]. Original warranty coverage expired decades ago with no parts availability through official channels. Documentation scarcity compounds support issues, with no manuals currently available for download and limited service documentation [1]. Electret elements can degrade over time. On units over 40 years old, sensitivity loss or malfunction may occur depending on the individual unit and how it was stored. The 230g construction with 3m cord presents potential points of failure with no replacement parts readily available [3]. Simple structure provides some inherent reliability, but age-related degradation and absence of support create substantial reliability risks for users.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This criterion is evaluated against the standards of the product's era (early 1980s), not current standards. The Aurex brand emphasized conventional electronic engineering and measurement-based design rather than subjective or occult claims [2]. The back-electret design followed a scientifically sound approach for the time, with objective specifications (frequency response, THD, maximum sound pressure level) published [1][3]. The design avoided non-scientific audibility claims and aligned with rational, mass-production-friendly engineering. For the early 1980s, the philosophy was measurement-focused and cost-effective relative to contemporary alternatives; the design philosophy is thus assessed as rational for its era.

## Advice

The HR-V9 should be considered primarily as a historical collectible rather than a functional audio device for current use. Potential buyers seeking equivalent or better functionality and measured performance at lower cost can choose from many current wired over-ear models with published specifications and third-party measurements. The vintage nature creates significant reliability risks for units over 40 years old, with no replacement parts or repair support available [2]. Audio enthusiasts interested in historical electret technology should be prepared for potential functionality issues and view the purchase as museum-quality equipment rather than daily-use audio gear.
