summary: "Retro-styled portable radio cassette recorder with Bluetooth TX/RX and ‘hi-res upconversion’; versatile but modest technical performance. Cost-performance is high only when you need its exact feature set."

## Overview

The Aurex TY-AK21 is a portable CD/radio/cassette unit that adds modern I/O: Bluetooth **receive and transmit** (TX/RX), SD/USB playback/record, and a vendor-promoted “upconvert to hi-res-like” mode. It uses a two-way bass-reflex speaker system with 6.4 cm woofers and 2 cm soft-dome tweeters, a digital amp rated **20 W + 20 W**, and Bluetooth 5.3. Media support includes CD-DA/MP3 plus FLAC/WAV up to 192 kHz/24-bit via USB/SD. FM (76–108 MHz) and AM are built in. These are manufacturer specs. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

There are **no independent lab measurements** (FR/THD/SINAD) for TY-AK21 as of Aug 21, 2025. Its small drivers and enclosure naturally limit low-frequency extension and linearity; cassette playback adds wow/flutter and a far lower dynamic range than digital. Typical compact cassette DR is on the order of **~50–56 dB**, far below 16-bit digital’s 96 dB, hence audible noise and constrained headroom are expected. [9] The **“hi-res upconversion”** mode generates added harmonics above 20 kHz but cannot recover information absent in the source; authoritative analyses find ultrahigh-rate audio provides no audible benefit versus 16-bit/44.1–48 kHz when properly implemented. Accordingly, we consider the claimed benefit scientifically weak. [1][8]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Internally, the TY-AK21 combines mature building blocks: a basic Class-D power stage, small two-way drivers, a cassette transport, and commodity Bluetooth 5.3 silicon. TX/RX over Bluetooth, SD/USB file playback up to 192/24, and simple DSP “upconvert” are practical but not novel in 2025. No proprietary acoustics, measurements, or engineering disclosures distinguish it from similar all-in-one “boombox” designs. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Price (review target):** 279 USD (reference market price **27,980円** in Japan; we present USD for the English edition). [3]

**Cheapest equivalent-or-better way to get the same user-facing functions:** In Japan, Toshiba’s **TY-CDX92** offers CD/cassette/AM-FM/SD/USB and **Bluetooth receive** at a lower price, and pairing it with a **Bluetooth transmitter** replicates TY-AK21’s TX function. Using current market prices:

- **Toshiba TY-CDX92**: 20,565円 (Bluetooth receive, CD/cassette/SD/USB). [6][7]  
- **Twelve South AirFly SE** (3.5 mm Bluetooth **transmitter**): 5,400円. [4][5]

**Cost-performance calculation (JPY basis):**  
**25,965円 ÷ 27,980円 = 0.93** → **0.9** after rounding to one decimal place.  
(The ratio is currency-invariant; USD conversion yields the same 0.93.)

We select this bundle because it **matches all user-visible functions** (CD/cassette/AM-FM/SD/USB, BT RX, and BT TX). No cheaper one-box with cassette **and** BT TX/RX was found. Where TY-AK21 is only available via import in the U.S., the ratio remains unchanged. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Aurex/Toshiba provides a standard support network for lifestyle audio in Japan. However, devices with **two mechanical transports** (CD and cassette) inevitably face belt wear, head wear, and alignment drift over time; cassette mechanisms in particular require periodic service. Firmware is not a factor; parts availability for cassette decks is a medium-term risk as the format declines. [2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

For users with legacy **cassette and CD libraries** who still want wireless output to headphones or speakers, the all-in-one approach is coherent: one box plays and even **transmits** to BT devices. Framing “upconversion” as a core benefit is questionable scientifically, but TX/RX, FLAC/WAV 192/24 from USB/SD, and a remote-friendly boombox form factor align with real-world convenience. [1][2][8]

## Advice

Buy the TY-AK21 **only** if you specifically need **cassette + CD + BT TX/RX in one box**. If you just want modern Bluetooth audio, a quality BT speaker paired with streaming will outperform this form factor. If you need its media flexibility at lower cost, consider **TY-CDX92 + a BT transmitter**; you’ll replicate the functions for less money, albeit in two pieces. If you own large cassette/CD archives and want to digitize, TY-AK21’s SD/USB recording and resume features are convenient, but audio transparency is limited by the sources themselves.
