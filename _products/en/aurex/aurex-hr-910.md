## Overview

The Toshiba Aurex HR-910 is a vintage electret condenser headphone released between 1975-1978 under Toshiba's premium Aurex brand. Priced at approximately 127 USD, it featured innovative back-electret technology with a 51mm polyester diaphragm and required a dedicated transformer adapter. As a historical product representing early electrostatic headphone development, it demonstrates the engineering approaches of its era while facing significant limitations by modern standards.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The HR-910 demonstrates performance at the problematic level borderline according to measurement criteria. The specified frequency response of 20-35 kHz lacks low-frequency extension below 20Hz and provides no deviation specifications for proper assessment. Most critically, the THD specification of <0.5% at 400Hz reaches the problematic threshold for headphones, where 0.5% represents the boundary between acceptable and problematic distortion levels. The sensitivity specification of >104dB (100Vrms input) and static capacitance of 60pF are documented [1], but essential measurements including S/N ratio (transparent level >100dB for headphones) and sound isolation data are completely absent. The absence of credible third-party measurements limits evaluation certainty, requiring reliance on manufacturer specifications for assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The HR-910 demonstrates moderate technological achievement for its 1975 release period. The proprietary back-electret system, separating diaphragm and electret elements for improved efficiency, represented genuine innovation worthy of patent protection. Toshiba's in-house design and development provided original engineering rather than OEM adoption. However, the purely analog/mechanical implementation without digital integration, software, or advanced system approaches limits the technology level by modern standards. The requirement for a separate transformer adapter box further demonstrates the technological constraints of the era. While the back-electret approach provided temporary competitive differentiation, it was eventually superseded by superior full electrostatic designs from manufacturers like STAX.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This evaluation is mechanically calculated by comparing the lowest price among equivalent-or-better products based on user-facing functions (wired/passive, analog connection, open-back class, no ANC/mic) and measured performance (the specific construction/method is not part of the comparison criteria). As a current equivalent with robust published measurements, we adopt the Philips SHP9500 (with third-party measurements covering frequency response consistency and THD such as 0.16% @94dB / 0.52% @104dB). The price is 79.98 USD (at the time of reference), while the review target price is approximately 127 USD.

CP = 79.98 USD ÷ 127 USD = 0.63 → 0.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The HR-910 faces severe reliability and support limitations due to its vintage status. No current warranty coverage exists, with the original 1975 warranty long expired. Toshiba's consumer audio division has been discontinued, leaving no parts supply, repair support, or manufacturer service infrastructure. Current Toshiba policy explicitly excludes consumer electronics repair support, directing customers to original equipment manufacturers or retailers. The only positive factor is the inherently simple electret design with few complex components, durable aluminum and polyester materials, and basic analog circuitry in the transformer adapter. However, ear pad degradation is commonly reported among existing units, and comprehensive failure rate statistics remain unknown.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The HR-910's design philosophy demonstrates sound engineering principles within 1975 technological constraints. The measurement-based engineering approach is evident through provided technical specifications for key parameters, without occult or pseudo-scientific claims. The back-electret innovation represents meaningful technological advancement for its era. However, significant costs dedicated to the specialized transformer adapter and complex dual-impedance system add expense without clear user benefits. The design lacks the advanced integration and optimization strategies that characterize highly rational modern audio products, including software signal processing, digital integration, or cost-reduction technologies. The purely analog implementation, while appropriate for 1975, demonstrates conservative rather than innovative approaches by current standards.

## Advice

The Aurex HR-910 serves primarily as a historical artifact demonstrating early electrostatic headphone development rather than a viable listening device. Potential purchasers should understand that no manufacturer support, parts availability, or repair infrastructure exists. Modern electrostatic alternatives like STAX products provide dramatically superior performance, full manufacturer support, and contemporary engineering approaches. For listeners seeking electrostatic technology, current market options deliver transparent-level performance with comprehensive measurement validation and ongoing support infrastructure that the vintage HR-910 cannot match.
