## Overview

The Aurex HR-V5 is a vintage electret condenser headphone from 1980, manufactured by Toshiba under their premium Aurex brand. This 4,000-ohm impedance headphone utilizes back-electret technology where electret material is positioned on the stator side, providing the polarizing field through permanent charge and eliminating the need for external polarizing voltage. Weighing 180 grams with a 2.5-meter cord, the HR-V5 represents an early attempt at high-end personal audio using electret transducer technology. As a 46-year-old product, it faces significant challenges from electret charge degradation and obsolete design approaches compared to modern headphone technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Manufacturer-published specifications for the HR-V5 are available from the HiFi Engine specifications page [1] and similar sources; no third-party measurement data exists. Specified values include 0.5% total harmonic distortion, 20Hz to 20kHz frequency response, and 105dB maximum output level. Critical specifications such as signal-to-noise ratio and passive isolation performance are absent from available documentation. A conservative adjustment of 0.1 toward 0.5 is applied due to the absence of third-party verification. Vintage electret technology is susceptible to charge degradation over time, and actual current performance may fall below original specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The HR-V5 employs 1980-era back-electret technology with built-in step-up transformers for its 4,000-ohm impedance. While the back-electret design represented sound engineering practice for its time, this approach has been completely superseded by modern driver technologies offering superior performance and reliability. The configuration with electret material on the stator side providing the polarizing field through permanent charge eliminates the need for external polarizing voltage and demonstrates technical competence, but lacks any contemporary relevance or competitive advantage. No proprietary patents or cutting-edge innovations distinguish this implementation from other electret designs of the period. The purely analog/mechanical construction offers no integration with modern digital processing, wireless connectivity, or software-based enhancements that define current headphone technology standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Current market price for vintage examples is approximately 180 USD. As comparison target with equivalent-or-better functions and measured performance, Sennheiser HD 560S (approximately 150 USD) is selected. The HD 560S is a wired over-ear headphone compatible with standard headphone outputs; third-party measurements by Rtings confirm THD well below 0.5%, with frequency response and sensitivity equivalent or superior to the HR-V5 manufacturer specifications. CP = 150 USD ÷ 180 USD = 0.83, rounded to 0.8 [2][3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The HR-V5 receives the lowest possible reliability score due to multiple fundamental limitations. No manufacturer warranty exists for this 46-year-old discontinued product, and Toshiba/Aurex ceased audio product support decades ago. Electret technology inherently suffers from charge degradation over extended periods, with documented voltage loss affecting performance predictability. No service manuals, replacement parts, or authorized repair services remain available through official channels. The vintage electret charge degradation issue represents a known failure mode that cannot be prevented or easily corrected. Third-party repair options may exist but lack manufacturer backing and standardized procedures. This combination of obsolete technology, ended support infrastructure, and inherent degradation characteristics provides no reliability foundation for current users.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The HR-V5 provided practical headphone functionality to users of its era through built-in step-up transformers enabling direct connection to standard amplifier outputs. Electret technology was a mainstream transducer approach in the 1980s, distinct from subjective or occult methodologies. However, the 0.5% distortion specification reflects acceptance of performance short of contemporary transparent standards rather than pursuit of transparent reproduction, and brand differentiation was prioritized over measurable performance improvement. Functional integration (built-in transformers eliminating external energizer requirements) is a positive factor, but evidence of measurement-focused development or cost-to-performance optimization remains limited.

## Advice

The Aurex HR-V5 cannot be recommended for current purchase due to fundamental performance and reliability limitations. Potential buyers should avoid vintage electret headphones unless acquiring them purely for historical interest rather than audio quality. Equivalent-or-better measured performance is available from modern wired headphones (e.g., Sennheiser HD 560S) at lower cost. For those interested in vintage audio equipment, focus on products with documented measurement data and available service support. Consider modern headphone alternatives for practical audio applications requiring reliable, transparent sound reproduction.
