## Overview

The Aurex HR-810II is a vintage electret condenser headphone from Toshiba's luxury audio division, part of the company's electrostatic headphone series that included models numbered 610, 710, 810, and 910. Aurex served as Toshiba's premium brand, positioned similarly to how Lexus relates to Toyota. The HR-810II employed an early "back-electret" structure in which the electret material is formed on the fixed stator side, while the lightweight Mylar diaphragm is biased via a high-value resistor to create the required electric field. The audio signal from a conventional power amplifier is applied to the fixed electrodes through a plug-integrated passive step-up transformer adapter, and the diaphragm is driven by the resulting changes in electric field rather than by direct voltage swing across the film itself. By integrating this passive transformer into an enlarged 1/4" phone plug, the system can be used directly from the speaker outputs of ordinary amplifiers without a separate energizer box, a configuration that was uncommon for electrostatic and electret headphones of the era. Documentation for the specific HR-810II model is extremely limited. The external sources cited in [1][2] describe the Aurex HR-810 family and Toshiba's back-electret line in general, but do not provide separate specifications for an "HR-810II" variant. This review therefore explicitly targets the HR-810II unit designation and interprets all series-level historical information in the context of this particular model only.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No credible third-party measurements or comprehensive manufacturer specifications are available for the HR-810II. Essential performance metrics including frequency response deviation, harmonic distortion levels, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, and crosstalk measurements remain unknown. While subjective descriptions from users describe the sound as "neutral, flat" and "very transparent," these qualitative assessments cannot substitute for objective measurement data required for scientific evaluation. This evaluation explicitly follows the "unable to evaluate" framework specified in evaluation guidelines: when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and even manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 and the insufficient data limitation is explicitly stated. The back-electret design theoretically offers superior frequency response compared to other electret approaches, but without measurement verification, performance claims cannot be substantiated [3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The HR-810II represents innovative engineering from its era through the back-electret design approach. This technology places electret material on stators rather than the diaphragm, allowing thicker electret material since it doesn't require movement, resulting in superior performance compared to conventional electret designs. The plug-integrated passive step-up transformer eliminates the need for a separate energizer box while maintaining electrostatic reproduction capabilities. Variants of this back-electret approach have been widely adopted in professional electret-condenser microphones, where back-electret capsules are one of the main architectures alongside other electret structures. However, as 1970s technology, it lacks modern digital integration, contemporary materials science advances, and cutting-edge technological features found in current audio equipment. While historically significant and technically sophisticated for its time, the technology has been superseded by modern approaches that achieve superior measured performance through digital processing and advanced driver technologies [4][5].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Cost-performance evaluation for the HR-810II cannot be conducted according to standard policy requirements due to the absence of current market availability and pricing. Comprehensive searches of current marketplaces including eBay, specialized audio retailers, and vintage equipment dealers found no active sales listings or recent transaction data for the HR-810II model. Without verified current market pricing, the required calculation of cheapest equivalent product price divided by review target price cannot be performed. The cheapest equivalent modern electrostatic system currently available is the Koss ESP950 at approximately 1,000 USD, which provides complete electrostatic reproduction capabilities including integrated amplification [6][8]. However, establishing a cost-performance ratio requires actual current market pricing for the review target, which is unavailable for this discontinued vintage product.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The HR-810II faces severe reliability and support limitations as vintage equipment from the 1970s. Toshiba discontinued the Aurex brand decades ago, eliminating all manufacturer warranty coverage and official repair channels. No authorized service infrastructure exists, and parts availability is extremely limited. While the simple electrostatic construction may provide inherent robustness compared to complex modern electronics, the approximately 50-year age of available units presents significant reliability concerns including component degradation, electret material aging, and potential failure of vintage electronic components. Third-party repair options may be theoretically available but would involve high costs and difficulty sourcing appropriate replacement parts. The lack of support infrastructure, obsolete components, and vintage equipment aging substantially impact long-term reliability prospects.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Rationality of design philosophy is evaluated by contemporary standards of the product's era, not by current technology. For the HR-810II, the back-electret design had clear scientific merit: this configuration was proven superior to other electret technologies and later became standard in professional electret-condenser microphones. The integrated step-up transformer in the connector represented practical engineering innovation that eliminated external energizer requirements while preserving electrostatic reproduction. For its time, the design avoided occult or subjectivity-based claims and followed engineering approaches with measurable rationale [7].

## Advice

The Aurex HR-810II appeals primarily to vintage audio collectors and electrostatic headphone enthusiasts interested in historical significance rather than contemporary performance. The unique integrated amplification design offers educational value for understanding electrostatic reproduction technology development. However, modern alternatives provide superior measured performance, reliability, and support at comparable or lower costs. For practical listening applications, current electrostatic systems like the Koss ESP950 or Stax entry-level options deliver better documented performance with manufacturer support. Purchase only if specifically seeking this exact vintage model for collection purposes, and expect significant limitations in serviceability, parts availability, and performance compared to modern standards. The lack of measurement data makes performance assessment impossible, creating uncertainty about actual audio quality relative to contemporary options.
