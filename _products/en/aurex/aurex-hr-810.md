## Overview

The Aurex HR-810 is an electret condenser headphone introduced around 1975 by Toshiba's luxury audio division. Originally priced at approximately 37 USD at 1975 exchange rates, this headphone employed a unique "back electret" design that separated the diaphragm from the electret material to enhance efficiency. The HR-810 featured integrated impedance matching with three selectable positions (H/M/L: 1kΩ/300Ω/8Ω) and included built-in step-up transformers within an enlarged 1/4" phone plug, eliminating the need for external energizer amplifiers typical of electrostatic designs. This innovative approach made electrostatic technology accessible to standard headphone outputs, representing significant engineering advancement for its era.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The HR-810's harmonic distortion of 0.5% at 400 Hz places it in the problematic range. Compared to modern headphone technology where THD below 0.05% is typical, a significant performance gap exists. Frequency response spans 20 Hz to 30 kHz, maximum sound pressure 115 dB, and sensitivity 95 dB/3V indicate adequate capability. With only manufacturer specifications and no third-party measurements, a conservative adjustment is applied, leaving scientific validity concerns against contemporary digital audio standards [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The HR-810's back-electret design applies electret material to stators with a metallized polyester diaphragm for audio, with integrated step-up transformers in the connector. Evaluated against current technology standards, this represents obsolete electret technology with no competitive advantage. The industry abandoned electret headphone technology decades ago; modern dynamic drivers and electrostatic implementations offer superior performance and cost-effectiveness. The purely analog/mechanical construction lacks integration with digital processing, wireless connectivity, or software-based enhancements that define current headphone technology [2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The HR-810 has been discontinued since 1975 with virtually no current retail availability; estimated secondary market price is approximately 500 USD. As comparison target with equivalent-or-better functions and measured performance, Sennheiser HD 560S (approximately 150 USD) is selected. The HD 560S is a wired over-ear headphone compatible with standard headphone outputs; third-party measurements by Rtings confirm THD well below 0.5%, with frequency response and sensitivity equivalent or superior to the HR-810. CP = 150 USD ÷ 500 USD = 0.30 [3][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The HR-810 receives the minimum reliability score due to fundamental limitations as a vintage product from 1975. No manufacturer warranty coverage exists, and official repair or parts supply for this specific model is not realistically available. Electret technology inherently suffers from charge degradation over time, with documented sensitivity loss affecting performance predictability. Third-party repair options may exist but lack manufacturer backing and standardized procedures; costs would be high due to extreme rarity and specialized electret technology requirements. The combination of obsolete technology, ended support infrastructure, and inherent degradation characteristics provides no reliability foundation for current users.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The HR-810 represents exceptionally rational engineering philosophy focused on measurable performance improvements. The back-electret design addressed specific engineering challenges in conventional electrostatic designs through scientific problem-solving rather than subjective approaches. Toshiba's development philosophy emphasized performance over cost-cutting—choosing "the template used for units higher up the price scale, which performed better rather than using simplified, cost-cutting approaches common in the industry." The integrated impedance matching eliminated external amplifier requirements, representing advanced functional integration that reduced system complexity and total cost for users while maintaining performance. This cost optimization directly contributed to function and measurement performance improvement. The innovative approach solved fundamental electrostatic design compromises through novel electrode configuration, demonstrating consistently rational scientific methodology focused on measurable benefits rather than marketing claims [5].

## Advice

The Aurex HR-810 is a historically significant product with innovative back-electret design and built-in impedance matching, but purchase requires careful consideration. Potential buyers must accept electret degradation risks, lack of warranty or support, and problematic distortion performance. Equivalent or better measured performance is available from modern wired headphones at lower cost (e.g., Sennheiser HD 560S), which are recommended for practical use. For vintage audio collectors, historical significance and innovative engineering hold value; purchase only from verified functional units and budget for potential electret replacement or repair costs.
