## Overview

The Aurex HR-710 is a lightweight condenser-type stereo headphone manufactured by Toshiba's premium Aurex division in 1975. Originally priced at approximately 27 USD at period exchange rates (circa 1975 [1]), equivalent to approximately 160 USD when adjusted for inflation to 2026 levels, it featured semi-open electret drivers with 51mm diaphragms and switchable impedance matching. The HR-710 employed back electret technology with newly developed high-voltage electret systems, representing Toshiba's attempt to create cost-effective electrostatic-style headphones. While innovative for its era, the technology proved to be a dead end with inherent limitations compared to both contemporary electrostatic alternatives and modern dynamic driver approaches.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The HR-710's measured performance presents significant limitations by current standards. The harmonic distortion of 0.5% at 400Hz [1] suggests performance below acceptable levels for headphones. Critical measurement data including S/N ratio, dynamic range, intermodulation distortion, and crosstalk are completely absent, preventing comprehensive evaluation of audio quality parameters. The frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz [1] is adequate, but without deviation measurements, true performance assessment is impossible. When credible third-party measurements are unavailable and comprehensive data is insufficient, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 as the product cannot be properly evaluated due to lack of essential measurement data for transparent audio quality assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The HR-710 employed back electret technology with newly developed high-voltage electret systems [1]. This represented proprietary in-house technology development with original design work by Toshiba. The electret approach offered convenience by eliminating external bias voltage requirements, addressing a practical limitation of traditional electrostatic designs. However, the technology proved to have fundamental limitations including charge degradation over time and inferior performance compared to true electrostatic designs. Industry shift away from electret headphone technology, with Stax having released electret model SR-80MX in 1990 before the technology ceased to be mainstream [2][4], demonstrates the approach's lack of long-term viability. By current standards, the technology is severely outdated with no competitive advantage and represents analog-only design without modern digital integration. While technically sophisticated for 1975, the engineering direction led to a technological dead end that other manufacturers avoided adopting due to its inherent limitations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The Aurex HR-710 is not available in new retail markets; while secondary market availability is not consistently stable, listings and completed sales exist on platforms such as Yahoo! Auctions Japan and Mercari as of 2026 [5]. When no established current market price exists for the review target product, the denominator (A) in the CP formula (B÷A) is unavailable, making cost-performance calculation impossible. While modern alternatives like the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x at 49 USD [3] provide superior functionality including better frequency response (15Hz-20kHz), professional studio monitor tuning, modern construction, and freedom from electret charge degradation issues, cost comparison cannot be performed without price information. Cost-Performance is set to 0.5 as unable to evaluate.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

No manufacturer warranty or support infrastructure exists for this 51-year-old product. Toshiba discontinued the Aurex brand decades ago, eliminating all official support channels. Electret headphone technology suffers from inherent charge degradation over time [2], with documented cases of volume reduction and performance degradation in surviving vintage units. Parts availability is extremely limited, and repair costs would exceed replacement value. The combination of inherent technological failure modes, complete absence of manufacturer support, zero warranty coverage, and unavailable replacement parts justifies the minimum reliability score. Users seeking dependable audio equipment should avoid vintage electret products due to their fundamental reliability limitations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The HR-710 represented Toshiba's attempt to create cost-effective electrostatic-style headphones through electret technology. While this showed engineering effort to eliminate external bias requirements, the design philosophy proved problematic as electret technology suffered from inherent charge degradation over time [2]. The technology direction led to a dead end, as evidenced by industry abandonment of electret headphone technology with major manufacturers like Stax having phased out electret models from their mainstream lineup around 1990 [2][4]. From current perspective, the approach pursued inferior performance compared to both contemporary electrostatic alternatives and modern dynamic driver designs. The cost optimization strategy resulted in performance compromises without achieving meaningful audibility improvements, contradicting rational engineering principles focused on measurable audio quality enhancement.

## Advice

The Aurex HR-710 should be avoided by users seeking functional audio equipment. Its problematic distortion levels, obsolete technology, and complete lack of support make it unsuitable for practical audio applications. Collectors interested in 1970s audio history may find value, but should expect degraded performance due to electret charge loss over five decades. For users seeking actual audio quality, modern professional headphones like the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x provide vastly superior performance, reliability, and support at significantly lower cost. The HR-710 serves primarily as a historical artifact demonstrating why electret headphone technology was abandoned by the industry.
