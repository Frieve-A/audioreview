## Overview

The Adam Audio D3V is a compact desktop active monitor released in 2024 by Adam Audio, a veteran German speaker manufacturer. It incorporates the company's distinctive D-ART (Desktop Accelerated Ribbon Technology) ribbon tweeter into a 3.5-inch compact enclosure, featuring a total output of 240W and DSP-based room correction functionality. Direct connection to computers is possible via USB-C, achieving a frequency response of 45Hz-23.2kHz (-6dB). With a maximum SPL of 97dB, this product aims to bring professional quality to desktop environments, responding to the growing demand for remote work and content creation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The measured performance of the Adam Audio D3V is generally good. The frequency response is 45Hz-23.2kHz (-6dB), securing sufficient bandwidth for a desktop monitor. The maximum SPL of 97dB is adequate for a small speaker. The D-ART ribbon tweeter provides high resolution in the high frequencies, and phase characteristics are optimized through DSP crossover. According to product category-specific application standards considering physical constraints of speakers, THD below 0.1% is excellent and above 1% is problematic, with the D3V being within an acceptable measurement range. The S/N ratio also achieves a sufficient level above 80dB, providing scientifically valid performance as a compact monitor.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The technical design level is highly commendable. The D-ART ribbon tweeter is the company's proprietary technology, achieving superior transient response and directivity compared to conventional dome tweeters. The 240W four-channel amplifier configuration with DSP active crossover represents a modern approach. The three-stage room correction function enables optimization of acoustic characteristics according to installation environment. The design philosophy of overcoming physical constraints within limited enclosure size through technology, such as ensuring rigidity of PC-ABS resin enclosure and low-frequency extension via 3.5-inch passive radiator, is praiseworthy. It demonstrates technical achievement exceeding industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

With a market price of around 45,000 JPY, competitors with comparable features and performance (such as DSP room correction, USB-C connectivity, and a 4-inch woofer), like the KRK GoAux 4, are priced significantly higher, starting from around 60,000 JPY. Currently, the Adam Audio D3V stands as one of the most affordable options among desktop monitors with similar functionalities, earning it a top score of 1.0 for cost-performance. Considering it also includes the proprietary D-ART ribbon tweeter technology, its value proposition is even stronger.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Adam Audio has established a solid position in the professional monitor field since its founding in 1999, with product reliability highly regarded in the industry. The D3V comes with a 5-year product warranty, activated through product registration. The company's domestic support system in Japan is well-established, with appropriate service expected for technical inquiries and repair support. DSP firmware update support may provide continuous functionality improvements and problem fixes. Despite being a compact product, the application of professional equipment quality control standards is commendable.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy is based on scientific evidence and is rational. The adoption of D-ART ribbon tweeters brings measurable high-frequency characteristic improvements, and DSP active crossover is effective for phase characteristic optimization. Room correction functionality is a rational approach to mitigate acoustic influences of installation environment. The design eliminating the need for external audio interfaces through direct USB-C connection contributes to improved convenience in desktop environments. However, the necessity of existing as dedicated audio equipment is debatable. Equivalent sound quality can be achieved through combinations with smartphones or general-purpose DACs, limiting the absolute advantage as a dedicated desktop monitor.

## Advice

The Adam Audio D3V is a technically excellent desktop monitor that represents exceptional value for its market price. It is a particularly worthy choice for professional music production environments where the acoustic characteristics of the Adam Audio brand and the D-ART tweeter can be fully appreciated. Compared to alternatives with similar features like the KRK GoAux 4, the D3V has a more competitive price point. As it is one of the most affordable products in its class for its feature set, the D3V is a highly recommended, high-cost-performance product for users seeking excellent technical performance.
