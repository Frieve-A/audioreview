## Overview

The Vestax VRM-1MK2 is a passive studio monitor speaker produced by Vestax Corporation, a Japanese audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1977 that went bankrupt in December 2014. Originally established as Shiino Musical Instruments Developing Corporation, Vestax expanded from electronic guitars to DJ mixers, turntables, and studio equipment before ceasing operations. The VRM-1MK2 represents their entry into the studio monitor market, designed with dimensions of 165(W) x 373(H) x 227(D)mm and weighing 11.0kg per pair. The product has gained attention in the used market as an affordable passive monitor option.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data. Extensive research found no credible third-party measurements for frequency response, THD, S/N ratio, or other audio-quality-relevant specifications. Manufacturer specifications from available sources provide only basic dimensional data (165x373x227mm, 11.0kg per pair) without comprehensive technical performance parameters. Even archived documentation searches yielded no detailed audio performance specifications. According to the evaluation framework, when both measured performance data and manufacturer specifications are unavailable for audio quality assessment, the score defaults to 0.5 representing inability to evaluate rather than poor performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The VRM-1MK2 represents basic passive monitor technology from a company that ceased operations in 2014. The design features simple construction with conventional tweeter replacement requiring only three screws and two wire connectors. No evidence exists of proprietary patent technology, cutting-edge implementation, or technical innovation. The analog-only design lacks digital integration or contemporary technology adoption. The ease of replication and absence of technical differentiation, combined with the manufacturer's bankruptcy indicating technological obsolescence, results in minimal technology level scoring.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price: 45 USD. Comprehensive analysis of passive studio monitors with equivalent or better functionality reveals limited cheaper alternatives. The used Wharfedale Diamond 8.1 typically costs 80-100 USD per pair [3] with equivalent passive monitor functionality and documented specifications. The JBL Control 1 Pro costs approximately 145-230 USD [4] representing a current production alternative with verified specifications including frequency response 100Hz-18kHz (Â±3dB) and professional 2-way driver configuration that are equivalent-or-better. No cheaper equivalent alternatives were identified in the current market, establishing the VRM-1MK2 as the lowest-cost option among available passive studio monitors with similar basic functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Reliability suffers from manufacturer bankruptcy in December 2014, eliminating all official support channels. Repair documentation indicates the tweeter component is easily breakable, requiring caution with microphone use and scratch sounds. However, the simple construction allows straightforward servicing with basic tools, and third-party parts remain available through specialized services. The combination of zero manufacturer support, known component fragility, but maintained serviceability through simple design results in below-average reliability scoring.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Design philosophy cannot be evaluated due to manufacturer bankruptcy making official design philosophy information unavailable. Available information consists only of basic dimensional data (165x373x227mm, 11.0kg per pair) with no official documentation regarding design philosophy or development approach. Third-party subjective evaluations lack scientific foundation and are excluded from evaluation. Design philosophy rationality is unassessable due to insufficient verifiable information.

## Advice

Consider the VRM-1MK2 only if seeking the absolute lowest-cost passive monitor option and accepting significant limitations. The lack of specifications makes performance assessment impossible, while manufacturer bankruptcy eliminates support. For reliable studio work, invest in current products with known specifications and manufacturer support like the JBL Control 1 Pro. The VRM-1MK2 suits only non-critical applications where cost is the sole consideration and performance requirements are minimal.
