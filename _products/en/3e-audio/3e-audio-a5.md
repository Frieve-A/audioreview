summary: "A compact dual-TPA3251 stereo amplifier with PFFB and balanced I/O. Independent measurements show ~121 W into 4Ω at 0.1% THD+N and sub--100 dB THD+N minima—transparent performance at a very low price."

## Overview

The 3e Audio A5 is a finished Class D stereo amplifier built around two TI TPA3251 chips in PBTL with a post-filter feedback (PFFB) loop. It offers RCA and balanced XLR/6.35 mm combo inputs, user-replaceable op-amps, volume-bypass mode, and auto signal sensing. The unit ships with a 38 V/5 A PSU and is specified for 2–16 Ω speakers (balanced input mode).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Third-party tests show the A5 delivers approximately **121 W into 4 Ω at 0.1% THD+N** (both channels, XLR input). THD+N vs power curves dip **below −100 dB** at typical listening levels, with 1 kHz FFTs around −100 dB at 1 W and about −104 dB at 5 W. Output impedance/damping is high enough to keep FR essentially flat, and the **frequency response is ~20 Hz–35 kHz within ±0.5 dB** (balanced mode). The design is stable down to **2 Ω** loads per documentation. Collectively, these data indicate transparent amplification under normal use. [1][2][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This is a careful, modern implementation of TI’s TPA3251 with **post-filter feedback**, swappable op-amps, balanced inputs, and volume-bypass. While the core silicon is mainstream, 3e’s execution (PFFB tuning, layout, features) reflects competent engineering rather than novel topology. [1][2][4]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**No cheaper finished amplifier was found that simultaneously offers balanced inputs and matches or exceeds the A5’s measured performance (≈121 W into 4 Ω at 0.1% THD+N and sub-100 dB THD+N minima).**  
Near-miss cheaper options:

- **Topping PA5 II Plus** (balanced TRS) measures **~102 W into 4 Ω at 0.1% THD+N**—~16% lower power, so it does not meet the A5’s performance criterion. [5]  
- **Fosi ZA3** (balanced/XLR-TRS) publishes **~89 dB SINAD** (manufacturer figure), which is below the −100 dB-class distortion demonstrated by the A5 at low power. [6]

Given the A5 street price of **240 USD** (with PSU) and the absence of a cheaper equal-or-better alternative, **CP = 1.0**. [3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The official user manual states a **1-year warranty**. As a small manufacturer, 3e Audio’s long-term service network remains modest, but the simple Class D architecture and documented specs (including auto on/off and protection) are reassuring. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The A5’s choices—balanced inputs, PFFB, high damping, volume bypass, and socketed op-amps—are all performance-oriented and verifiably beneficial. Independent measurements corroborate the intended outcomes (low distortion/noise, linear FR). [1][2][3]

## Advice

If you specifically need **balanced inputs** and want **transparent, ~120 W-class** stereo power into 4 Ω with lab-verified low distortion, the A5 is outstanding value. If balanced I/O or the −100 dB-class distortion target is not essential, cheaper amps exist—but they will fall short on at least one of these metrics.
