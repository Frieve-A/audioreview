## Overview

3e Audio A7 is a finished stereo power amplifier built around **two** Texas Instruments TPA3255 chips operated per-channel in PBTL, with **post-filter feedback (PFFB)** to minimize load-dependency. It provides **balanced XLR/TRS combo** and **single-ended RCA** inputs, a volume-bypass mode, and user-swappable DIP-8 op-amps (OPA1612A by default). The A7 series launched in 2024 and is commonly sold with a **48V/10A PSU** included depending on SKU. [2][5][1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Manufacturer measurements (A7, Balanced input):** THD+N **0.0006% @ 5W** (4/8Ω), SNR **126 dB (A-wt, 1% THD+N, 1 kHz)**, dynamic range **126 dB**, frequency response **20 Hz–35 kHz (±0.5 dB)**, noise **<15 µVrms**, crosstalk **−110 dB**, gain **20 dB**, input sensitivity **3.5 Vrms**. Single-ended RCA figures are similarly excellent (THD+N 0.0007% @ 5W, SNR 123 dB). [1]

**Independent data (A7 family):** Bench tests on the **A7 Mono** (same next-gen PFFB platform) show THD+N minima **below −100 dB** (~0.001%) around 1–5 W and **“hi-fi” power** over **200 W** (<0.1% THD+N) into 4Ω, corroborating the platform’s transparency and power capability. Output impedance was measured **just over 10 mΩ**, implying damping factor ≈**400** with 4Ω loads. [4][3]

Together, these figures comfortably meet the transparency thresholds for amplifiers across FR, THD+N, SNR, dynamic range, crosstalk, and damping factor.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The A7 is an **evolutionary** but well-executed design: dual-TPA3255 PBTL channels with **PFFB**, low output impedance, and replaceable front-end op-amps. While the chipset is established, the implementation (board layout, feedback network, EMI control) and balanced I/O elevate measured performance beyond typical budget Class-D builds. [1][2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Denominator (this product):** **300 USD**.

We surveyed cheaper finished stereo amps to find **equal-or-better** function **and** measured performance:

- **Fosi V3 (stereo):** Cheaper, but **RCA-only** (no balanced input) → fails functional equivalence. [10]
- **Fosi ZA3 (balanced):** Has XLR/TRS, but independent tests show **lower SINAD (~≤89 dB)** / higher noise than A7 family → fails measured-performance equivalence. [6]
- **TOPPING PA5 II/II+ (balanced):** Excellent low-level THD+N, but **maximum power ~100–125 W/4Ω @1%** vs A7’s **250 W/4Ω @1%** (well outside ±5%) → fails output-performance equivalence. [7][8][12]

As of this review, we could not identify any **cheaper** finished stereo product that **matches or exceeds** the A7’s **balanced I/O + transparent metrics + ≥250 W/4Ω output**. Therefore, by definition, **CP = 1.0**. [1][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Solid-state Class-D topology, conservative PFFB implementation, and minimal moving parts suggest good inherent reliability. 3e’s recent firmware/behavior **update** lengthened **auto power-off to 20 minutes**, **raised audio-sensing thresholds** to **RCA 200 µVrms / XLR 400 µVrms**, and added a **user toggle** to disable/enable auto-sensing—addressing low-volume users’ reports. Typical retail packages include a **48V/10A PSU**. Long-term field data is still limited given the product’s youth. [5][1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The A7 channels spend strictly on **measurable** fidelity: PFFB to defeat load-dependence, robust power headroom, balanced input path for lower noise, and serviceable front-end op-amps—**no** cosmetic excess. The design choices map directly to improved FR linearity, THD+N, SNR, crosstalk, and damping. [1][3][4]

## Advice

If you need a **compact, balanced-input** power amp that remains **transparent** at typical listening levels yet supplies **≥250 W/4Ω (1% THD+N)** and supports **2–16Ω loads**, the A7 is an evidence-based choice. If balanced input is unnecessary and budget is paramount, cheaper options exist (e.g., Fosi V3), but they do **not** meet the same functional or measured-performance bar used in this review.
