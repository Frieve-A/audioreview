## Overview

The Topping PA5 II is a compact desktop Class-D power amplifier specified at 100 W ×2 into 4 Ω (at 1 % THD) with both TRS balanced and RCA inputs in a 16.6 × 12.9 × 4.1 cm chassis. It provides a 12 V trigger, ships with a 38 V/3 A supply, and targets transparent, load-invariant behavior from a balanced signal path. [2][3][4]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Manufacturer-published specs (PA5 II):** THD+N as low as 0.0004 % @ 4 Ω, 5 W (balanced), and 0.0003 % @ 8 Ω, 5 W; frequency response 20 Hz–40 kHz (±0.3 dB); dynamic range/SNR 121 dB (A-wt @1 kHz); crosstalk −90 dB @1 kHz; noise <15 µVrms (A-wt). These comfortably clear transparency thresholds (THD+N ≤0.01 %, DR/SNR ≥105 dB). [2][3]

**Third-party evidence (closely related PA5 II Plus):** Independent measurements report ~600 kHz switching with well-attenuated ultrasonic content and **damping factor >100** across the band (very low output impedance). Power testing shows **≈102 W/4 Ω (both channels) at 0.1 % THD+N** for the Plus model, consistent with Topping’s 100 W/4 Ω theme for the non-Plus at stricter distortion limits than brochure 1 %. [4][1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Balanced desktop Class-D implementation with sensible features (balanced/TRS input, 12 V trigger) executed to a high measured standard. The design follows well-understood TI-based Class-D practices rather than introducing novel topologies or proprietary control schemes. Solid engineering, modest innovation. [2][4]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Market price (denominator): 199 USD.** We surveyed balanced desktop power amps with **equal-or-better functions and measured performance**. **None cheaper than PA5 II met or exceeded its key specs** (e.g., THD+N ≈0.0004 % @5 W/4 Ω and SNR ≈121 dB). Examples of **excluded (inferior) candidates**: **SMSL AO200 MKII** (THD+N 0.004 %, SNR 106 dB) [6]; **AIYIMA A70** (THD+N 0.0015 % @1 W, SNR ≥116 dB) [7]; **Sabaj A20a 2022** (THD+N 0.004 %, SNR 103 dB) [8]. Therefore, **no cheaper equal-or-better option exists → CP = 1.0**. [2][3][6][7][8]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Topping’s desktop line has wide distribution and typical warranty coverage. The PA5 II series addresses prior-generation concerns with a refreshed platform and higher damping-factor behavior observed in independent tests of the Plus variant. Still, warranty length and service differentiation are average. [4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing **measurable transparency** (very low THD+N, high DR, low output impedance) in a compact, balanced form is rational and aligns with fidelity-first goals. The approach focuses on audible performance rather than cosmetic or myth-driven features. [2][3][4]

## Advice

Choose PA5 II if you specifically want **a compact balanced desktop power amp with verified transparent-class specs** and a tidy trigger-friendly stack. If you only need “audibly transparent” at the lowest price and can accept **inferior measured margins**, options like **Fosi ZA3** are cheaper but do **not** meet or exceed PA5 II’s measurement levels; they are therefore excluded from CP. [5][6][7][8]
