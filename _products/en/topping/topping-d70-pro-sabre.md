## Overview

The Topping D70 Pro Sabre is a premium desktop DAC using ESS’s flagship ES9039SPRO in an 8-channel configuration (four channels paralleled per side). Released in **2023**, it offers USB, optical, coaxial, AES, and Bluetooth 5.1 (LDAC/aptX Adaptive/aptX HD/AAC/SBC) connectivity [2]. The full-color **Aurora UI** shows playback info plus FFT/VU views, and the unit supports **seven** PCM filter options (F-1 to F-7) and “Sound mode” voicings (Off/Valve/Transistor) [2]. Output can be set to standard 2.1 V/4.2 V or boosted **2.5 V (RCA) / 5.0 V (XLR)** for wider compatibility [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Manufacturer-published lab data indicate **THD+N (A-wt)** of **<0.00006% (XLR)** and **<0.00008% (RCA)** at 1 kHz, **dynamic range** up to **133 dB (XLR)** / **128 dB (RCA)**, **noise** <1.0 µVrms, and **crosstalk** reaching **-140 dB (XLR)** / **-128 dB (RCA)**—all comfortably within transparency targets for a DAC [3]. Independent testing at **Audio Science Review** using an APx555 analyzer confirms extremely low distortion/noise consistent with state-of-the-art performance for this class [1]. These figures place the D70 Pro Sabre well beyond audibility limits for linear DAC behavior.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design leverages ESS’s top ES9039SPRO with parallel channel summing, XMOS XU316 USB, selectable output levels (incl. 5 V XLR), and a responsive UI. It also provides seven ESS PCM filters and on-device “Sound mode” options [2][3]. While execution is polished, most building blocks are industry-standard rather than proprietary breakthroughs, so we view the technology level as strong but not novel.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Current market price (US)**: **699 USD**.  
The **cheapest product with equal or better function & measured transparency** we can verify is the **Topping E70 (ESS ES9028PRO)** at **279 USD**. It provides balanced XLR/RCA, Bluetooth 5.1 with LDAC, and manufacturer-published **THD+N (A-wt) <0.00006% (XLR)** with **SNR/Dyn. Range 132 dB** [6].  
**CP calculation**: **279 USD ÷ 699 USD = 0.40** → score 0.4.  

Notes: If you prefer AKM’s “Velvet” line, the **E70 Velvet** is widely available around **349 USD** with **THD+N (A-wt) <0.00006% (XLR)** and LDAC as well [7][8]. We still use E70 (279 USD) for CP because it is the **lowest-priced** verified option meeting the functionality & transparency criteria.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Official warranty is **1 year** worldwide [4]. Topping provides downloadable manuals/drivers and has released firmware for this model (e.g., **D70 Pro Sabre v1.08** on **2024-05-31**, bug fixes for VU bar, etc.) [2][5]. Documentation and update cadence are reasonable, but the one-year term is average, so we rate reliability/support slightly above midpoint.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The product is engineered toward measurable transparency through parallel DAC channels, low-noise I/V stages, and thorough I/O coverage without unnecessary frills. The feature set (LDAC BT, adjustable output level, filters) solves practical integration issues while maintaining objective performance priorities.

## Advice

If you want a feature-rich, measurement-transparent DAC with a premium UI and balanced outputs, the **D70 Pro Sabre** is excellent. If value dominates, the **E70 (279 USD)** achieves comparable transparency and functionality at **~40%** of the price [6]. Prefer AKM? The **E70 Velvet (349 USD)** is also a strong, transparent alternative with LDAC and balanced I/O [7][8]. Choose the D70 Pro Sabre if you want the Aurora UI, boosted output options, and the assurance of top-tier measured headroom; otherwise, the E70 series will satisfy most transparency-focused needs at lower cost.
