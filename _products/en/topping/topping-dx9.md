## Overview

The DX9 is TOPPING’s 15th-anniversary limited-edition DAC/headphone amplifier featuring AKM’s AK4499EQ converter, dual color displays (Aurora UI), and a six-module discrete NFCA headphone stage. Manufacturer specs claim 132 dB dynamic range and THD+N <0.00007% (line out), while the amp section is rated up to 7080 mW×2 @32 Ω balanced. Connectivity includes AES/USB/2×Opt/2×Coax/I²S and Bluetooth with LDAC support, plus independent line/pre outs. [1][2][7]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Independent bench work shows the DX9 operating at transparently low distortion/noise: THD+N around −125 dB (A-wt) on high-level outputs, USB jitter markedly lower than S/PDIF, and correct wideband response after firmware v1.23. These results surpass transparent thresholds (e.g., ≥105 dB SNR/dynamic range). We list manufacturer specs separately as reference (XLR DR 131–132 dB; THD+N <0.00007%). [3][7]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AK4499EQ (quad-channel) implementation, six discrete NFCA amp modules, AK4118 S/PDIF receiver, CPLD clock/signal handling, and Aurora UI demonstrate a modern, well-integrated platform. While the design is sophisticated, most elements are high-grade industry components rather than unique proprietary breakthroughs. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 1299 USD for DX9, the cheapest equal-or-better way to achieve the same functions and transparent measured performance today is a two-box combo: TOPPING A70 Pro headphone amp (499 USD) + Gustard X18 DAC (749 USD). Together they provide balanced HP drive, AES/Coax/Opt/USB/I²S digital inputs, and LDAC BT, with transparent-level specs. Calculation: 1248 USD ÷ 1299 USD = 0.9607 → 1.0. [2][4][5]

*Equivalence note:* “DAC with AES/Coax/Opt/USB/I²S and LDAC BT + high-power balanced HP amp; THD+N/SNR are transparent (≥105 dB) or better.” [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Warranty baseline is strong (2-year coverage for amplifier-class products via retailer/manufacturer). Build appears robust; firmware issues (e.g., 176.4/192 kHz FR) were addressed quickly. As a limited run now sold out/discontinued at some dealers, future parts availability is a mild risk. [2][6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Base 0.5, then ±0.1 adjustments per rubric:

- **Scientific approach**（measurement-first engineering, no occult claims）:+0.1  
- **Functional integration**（DAC+pre+powerful HP amp with broad I/O）:+0.1  
- **Cost-effectiveness of design**（dual displays/glass “sunroof” add cost without audible gains）:−0.1  
- **Cost optimization**（ornamentation/limited-edition premium over function）:−0.1  

Net = 0.5. This judgment is independent from other scores. [1][2]

## Advice

If you want a single, handsome box with transparent DAC performance, serious balanced HP power, and polished UI, the DX9 satisfies superbly. If you prioritize value, the A70 Pro + X18 combo delivers equal practical capability and transparency for slightly less money, at the cost of an extra chassis and cable. [2][4][5]
