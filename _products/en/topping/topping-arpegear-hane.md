summary: "Topping's first IEM under their new ArpegEar brand, featuring a 10mm dynamic driver at $129 with 16 tuning options via 4 DIP switches. Measurements show low THD <0.05% at 90dB SPL, but rising to 5% at 110dB. Features aggressive V-shaped sound signature. Compared to competitors like Truthear Hexa ($89.99) and Dunu Titan S (under $100), the price-performance advantage is limited."

## Overview

The Topping ArpegEar Hane is the inaugural IEM from DAC-renowned Topping under their new ArpegEar brand, released in 2024. Priced at $129, it features a 10mm dynamic driver with DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating. Its primary feature is 16 tuning options via 4 DIP switches. Specifications include 80Ω±15% impedance, 115dB/Vrms sensitivity, and 5Hz-35kHz frequency response. The housing uses glossy black resin with blue feathered faceplates.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Measurement data shows favorable THD <0.05% at normal listening levels (90dB SPL). However, at 110dB, distortion rises to 5%, particularly pronounced in bass and midrange regions. The frequency response covers 5Hz-35kHz, demonstrating excellent specifications. The DIP switch tuning functionality produces measurable and audible differences, providing scientific basis for its claims. However, measurements indicate that switch usage increases THD, creating a trade-off between sound customization and distortion performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The DLC-coated dynamic driver adoption shows technical consideration. The 4 DIP switch electronic crossover approach for sound tuning represents an interesting technical implementation. The 80Ω impedance design, while challenging for smartphone driving, appears intentional. However, from 2024's technical standards, the single dynamic driver configuration isn't particularly advanced. The fact that tuning functionality increases THD raises questions about technical refinement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Hane costs $129, but superior or equivalent competitors exist at lower prices. The Truthear Hexa ($89.99) offers excellent hybrid configuration with neutral tuning, while the Dunu Titan S (under $100) provides engaging sound with wide soundstage. Additionally, the 7Hz Salnotes Zero 2 (~$20-30) demonstrates $100-class IEM performance. CP = $89.99 ÷ $129 = 0.70, clearly indicating overpricing. While tuning functionality adds value, it doesn't justify the premium when basic performance lags competitors.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Topping maintains established quality control from their DAC expertise, suggesting reasonable reliability expectations for IEMs. The detachable 0.78mm 2-pin cable enables replacement and upgrades. However, ArpegEar is a new brand lacking long-term IEM track record. Warranty and support show no particular advantages. The numerous mechanical DIP switches raise concerns about long-term reliability during extended use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 16 tuning option approach represents rational thinking toward user preference accommodation. The flexibility from monitor-like neutral to aggressive V-shaped signatures is appreciable. However, the implementation causing THD increases reveals design philosophy contradictions. The 80Ω impedance design lacks rationality considering modern mobile device usage. Prioritizing functionality over fundamental sound quality appears counterproductive for audio products.

## Advice

The Topping ArpegEar Hane offers interesting tuning functionality but is difficult to recommend in 2024's competitive IEM market. With a $129 budget, consider alternatives like the Truthear Hexa ($79.99) or Dunu Titan S (under $100), which provide superior fundamental performance. The Truthear Hexa particularly offers neutral tuning and excellent coherency, leaving budget for better cables or ear tips. The Hane might only appeal to users frequently utilizing tuning functionality, but even then, one must accept sound quality degradation from adjustments.
