## Overview

The Topping D70 Pro Octo is a desktop DAC product equipped with 8 Cirrus Logic CS43198 DAC chips. Consolidating the company's technical expertise, it achieves high-resolution playback capability of PCM768kHz/32bit and DSD512 support, along with industry-leading measurement performance of THD+N 0.00007% and SNR 134dB. Featuring the XMOS XU316 USB processor, Bluetooth 5.1 with LDAC/aptX support, color display with FFT/VU visualization, and preamp functionality, it is positioned as a comprehensive DAC product that covers modern features.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measurement performance achieves industry-leading standards. THD+N 0.00007% (XLR) significantly exceeds the transparent level of 0.01%, and SNR 134dB (XLR) greatly surpasses the transparent level of 105dB. The frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (±0.05dB) substantially improves upon the transparent level of ±0.5dB, and crosstalk -149dB@1kHz (XLR) vastly exceeds the transparent level of -70dB. Dynamic range 134dB (XLR) also significantly surpasses the transparent level of 105dB, achieving transparent levels across all measurement categories. The multi-DAC configuration with 8 CS43198 chips provides clear performance improvements both theoretically and in measured values, delivering audibly meaningful improvements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The multi-DAC design employing 8 CS43198 flagship DAC chips represents an advanced approach within the industry. The XMOS XU316 USB processor provides current state-of-the-art processing capability, and PCM768kHz/32bit, DSD512 support demonstrates current technological achievements. The color display FFT/VU visualization function is not mere decoration but a practical technical implementation that visualizes acoustic information. Bluetooth 5.1 support for multiple codecs ensures modern connectivity, achieving comprehensive technical implementation positioned at industry high standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Against 599 USD (approximately 90,000 yen), the cheapest alternative product with equivalent or superior functionality and measurement performance is the Topping E70 Velvet (449 USD, approximately 67,000 yen). The E70 Velvet employs the AK4499EX DAC chip and provides equivalent levels to the D70 Pro Octo in basic measurement performance and functionality, including THD+N -125dB, PCM768kHz/32bit, and DSD512 support. Cost-performance calculation: 449 USD ÷ 599 USD = 0.75, resulting in a score of 0.8 after rounding. The SMSL SU-10 (899.99 USD) competes in performance but is more expensive than the D70 Pro Octo, making it unsuitable for cost-performance comparison.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Topping holds an established position as a Chinese audio manufacturer with a track record from past product lines. While providing standard warranty periods and support systems, compared to established Western manufacturers, the accumulation period of track record is shorter and long-term reliability data is limited. Product quality control is good with no reports of major quality issues found, but it doesn't reach industry-leading standards. Firmware update support also remains at standard levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy of pursuing performance based on scientific measurement is extremely rational. The multi-DAC configuration with 8 DAC chips is a theoretically grounded performance improvement method, and actual measurement results support this. The development policy that eliminates audio myths and unscientific claims while focusing purely on measurement performance improvement is highly commendable. The comprehensive design approach considers both practicality and transparency improvement, incorporating diverse input options, modern connectivity, and visual feedback functions. While not price-breaking, reasonable pricing has been set for the invested technology.

## Advice

The D70 Pro Octo is a technically excellent DAC product with superior measurement performance. The price of 599 USD results in a 75% cost-performance ratio compared to the cheapest equivalent alternative, the E70 Velvet (449 USD). Considering the industry-leading measurement performance from 8 CS43198 chips and technical implementation superior to the E70 Velvet, the 150 USD price difference can be judged as reasonable compensation for technical superiority. It is recommended for users who pursue the highest level of measurement performance and emphasize multifunctionality. Conversely, users who consider basic transparency achievement sufficient may achieve equivalent audio satisfaction with the E70 Velvet. Compared to more expensive competing products (such as the SMSL SU-10 at 899.99 USD), the D70 Pro Octo achieves excellent cost-performance.
