## Overview

The Topping D50III is a desktop DAC and preamp featuring dual ES9039Q2M DAC chips. It supports PCM 768kHz/32bit and DSD512, with diverse functionality including Bluetooth 5.1 (LDAC support), 10-band parametric EQ, preamp mode, and remote control. Boasting measured specifications of 132dB SNR and THD+N 0.00006%, it enters the desktop audio market at USD 229.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The balanced output measurements of THD+N 0.00006%, SNR 132dB, and dynamic range 132dB demonstrate highest-level performance far exceeding transparent levels. Frequency response of ±0.1dB from 20Hz-20kHz and ±0.3dB from 20Hz-40kHz is extremely excellent, achieving scientifically valid high standards in the audible range. The dual ES9039Q2M configuration's improved channel separation and crosstalk of -147dB@1kHz realize industry-leading performance in objective measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The combination of dual ES9039Q2M DAC chips with XMOS XU316 USB interface demonstrates above-industry-standard technical capability. The implementation of 10-band parametric EQ represents Topping's first attempt at this technology, showing technical advancement. The Bluetooth 5.1 QCC5125 chipset supporting LDAC, aptX-HD, and aptX-Adaptive also represents modern design. However, the basic DAC chips are essentially off-the-shelf components with limited innovative proprietary technical elements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The D50III is priced at USD 229, but powerful competitive products exist in the same price range. The JDS Labs Atom DAC 2 (USD 129, SNR 117dB, THD+N 0.0004%) provides high performance at approximately half the price, while the iFi Zen DAC 3 (USD 229, equivalent functionality) directly competes at the same price. Calculating with the cheapest equivalent product assumed at USD 150: USD 150 ÷ USD 229 = 0.65, which rounds to 0.7, but considering functional complexity, we score 0.6. More affordable options exist for those not requiring multi-functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Topping provides stable product supply and support systems as an established audio brand. The D50III has a low failure rate with no major issues reported in user reviews. The company maintains an international sales network with detailed technical specifications publicly available. The design considering system integration through remote control, external power supply, and 12V trigger output receives high evaluation for long-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The dual ES9039Q2M configuration directly contributing to measurement performance improvements represents a rational design decision. The 10-band parametric EQ implementation adopts a modern and scientific approach to sound adjustment through digital signal processing. Practical functions like high-quality wireless support via Bluetooth 5.1 and convenience improvements through preamp mode are comprehensively covered. No unscientific sound quality improvement claims are present, with a consistent design philosophy based on objective measurement values.

## Advice

The D50III possesses highest-level performance in measurement specifications, but requires careful consideration in purchase decisions due to competitive products in its price range. For those prioritizing multi-functionality including 10-band parametric EQ, Bluetooth LDAC support, and preamp functionality, it becomes an excellent choice. However, for those seeking pure DAC functionality alone, the JDS Labs Atom DAC 2 (USD 129, SNR 117dB, THD+N 0.0004%) provides sufficient performance. In environments requiring system integration with remote control and 12V trigger output, it becomes a reasonable choice considering the value of additional features. It's a suitable product for advanced audiophiles who prioritize measurement data.
