summary: "Topping LA90 achieves world-class measured transparency (ultra-low THD+N, extraordinary SNR/crosstalk) with a discrete NFCA Class AB design. No cheaper product surpasses its measurement-level transparency and user functions; thus CP=1.0. Official coverage for amplifier products is 2 years."

## Overview

The Topping LA90 is a discrete Class AB power amplifier using the company’s NFCA (Nested Feedback Composite Amplifier) topology. In stereo it is specified for 120W per channel into 4 ohms and 66W into 8 ohms, with bridged mono available for higher power. It provides three balanced XLR/TRS inputs, two gain settings, a 12V trigger, selectable volume/bypass, and a passive-cooled all-aluminum chassis. [2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Independent measurements show vanishing distortion/noise that comfortably exceed transparency thresholds across THD+N, SNR, crosstalk, and bandwidth. Audio Science Review documents state-of-the-art low THD+N for the LA90 Discrete; the Absolute Sound notes a **published** S/N of **143 dB (mono)** alongside ultra-low distortion (manufacturer-stated). In stereo, published SNR is 141 dB with wide bandwidth (10 Hz–100 kHz). Taken together, these results place the LA90 at the world-leading tier for measured transparency—audibility-wise, effectively perfect. [1][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

A fully discrete NFCA implementation, balanced multi-input architecture, precision gain options, and meticulous mechanical design reflect significant in-house engineering. While Class AB is mature, the execution and outcomes demonstrate high technical sophistication beyond commodity IC solutions. [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Review target price:** 800 USD.  
To score CP we must compare against the **cheapest product that matches or exceeds both user-facing functions and measured transparency**. Our survey finds that products which meet or exceed the LA90’s transparency **and** provide comparable functionality (balanced input, high power/mono option) are **more expensive**—e.g., Hypex NCx500 finished stereo amps (≈1,050 USD) and Benchmark AHB2 (≈3,499 USD). Therefore, **no cheaper equal-or-better option exists at time of review** → **CP = 1.0**. [5][6][7]

*Note:* Cost-effective amps like Fosi ZA3 exist but do **not** surpass the LA90’s measurement tier (e.g., lower SNR/SINAD), so they cannot be used as CP comparators per the rule requiring equal-or-better measured performance. They remain good budget alternatives if “transparent enough” is the goal. [8][9]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

TOPPING’s official page states a **2-year coverage** for amplifier products (effective since January 2022; retailer year + TOPPING year, region-dependent). Support is primarily dealer-mediated. The passively cooled, simple discrete output stage and external PSU are favorable for reliability, but global service still relies on channel partners. Overall above-average. [10]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Pursuing vanishing distortion/noise via discrete NFCA is scientifically grounded and demonstrably effective. The approach optimizes measured transparency rather than cost, but it advances the state of the art without resorting to non-scientific claims. Given available cheaper “transparent-enough” amps, the philosophy is highly rational for measurement maximizers, less so for strict cost minimization. [1][4][8]

## Advice

Choose the LA90 if you value **best-in-class measurements** in a compact, balanced, discrete Class AB amplifier with stereo/mono flexibility. If you simply need audibly transparent amplification at the lowest cost, consider budget Class D options (e.g., Fosi ZA3); just note they **do not** exceed the LA90’s measurement tier. If you need higher power with similarly excellent transparency and balanced inputs, look at **NCx500-based** builds or **Benchmark AHB2**—but expect higher prices. [5][6][8]
