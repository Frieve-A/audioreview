## Overview

The Topping DX7 Pro+ is a desktop DAC and headphone amplifier combo built around the flagship ESS ES9038PRO DAC and Topping’s NFCA amplifier stage. Originally priced at 699 USD, it integrates DAC, Bluetooth receiver, preamplifier, and headphone amplifier functions with comprehensive connectivity (USB, coaxial, optical, AES, I2S, Bluetooth with LDAC/aptX family). As of 2025, new-unit availability is limited to remaining dealer stock in many regions; most listings show sold-out status or intermittent inventory. Bluetooth codec support is LDAC/AAC/SBC plus aptX/aptX LL/aptX HD/aptX Adaptive; retailers list Bluetooth 5.1 for this model. [3][5]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Independent measurements confirm the DX7 Pro+ comfortably exceeds transparent thresholds. Audio Science Review reports ~121 dB SINAD on XLR line out—well above the ~105 dB transparency line—and an overall “instrument-grade” showing across tests. [1] Manufacturer specs list SNR/dynamic range up to 133 dB (XLR) with extremely low THD+N; headphone-amp THD+N at 1 kHz is below 0.00009% at 150 mW/32 Ω. [6] Maximum headphone output is specified at 1900 mW ×2 into 32 Ω and 320 mW ×2 into 300 Ω, sufficient for virtually all dynamic and many planar headphones; both the 4-pin XLR and 6.35 mm jacks share the same power rating. [3][4] Taken together, the DX7 Pro+ achieves transparent performance across SINAD, THD+N, SNR, and frequency response.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design employs established, high-performance blocks (ES9038PRO DAC, NFCA amplification, XMOS USB) and a Qualcomm QCC5125 Bluetooth receiver that feeds digital audio to the main DAC to avoid the SoC’s internal DAC. Supported Bluetooth codecs include LDAC and the aptX family (incl. Adaptive). [3][5] Engineering choices target low distortion and noise rather than novelty, and while the execution is excellent, the architecture reflects refined mainstream practice rather than category-moving innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

At 699 USD, clearly cheaper products deliver equivalent user-visible functions and measured transparency. A strong example is the Sabaj A20d 2022 at 419 USD: it offers the same ES9038PRO-class DAC performance with line XLR/RCA, headphone outputs (6.35 mm and 4.4 mm), and Bluetooth (LDAC), and independent measurements show ~120 dB-class performance—i.e., transparent to the source. [2] Using the policy formula with the DX7 Pro+ price as denominator: **419 USD ÷ 699 USD = 0.599 → 0.6**. The DX7 Pro+ no longer justifies a price premium on audible performance or features.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Topping products generally ship with standard 2-year coverage via authorized channels and have seen periodic firmware updates (DX7 Pro+ V1.90 listed on the official site). [5] The circuit blocks (ES9038PRO + NFCA) are well-proven, suggesting good durability. That said, many retailers now show the DX7 Pro+ as sold out, which can complicate future parts/support for new buyers; ongoing support is better assured with models currently in production.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The DX7 Pro+ prioritizes measurable fidelity: low THD+N/SINAD, high SNR/dynamic range, and wide-ranging digital I/O. Bluetooth is implemented as a convenience feature without compromising wired paths (the BT SoC’s digital stream is routed to the main DAC). [3] Design choices align with audibility-focused engineering rather than subjective voicing. Pricing, however, is no longer competitive against equally transparent, lower-cost rivals.

## Advice

If you find a DX7 Pro+ at a meaningfully reduced price in the used or remaining-stock market, it is a safe pick for transparent performance and a robust all-in-one feature set. Otherwise, consider currently manufactured alternatives that deliver the same functions and transparency at lower prices—e.g., Sabaj A20d 2022 around 419 USD when in stock—for better long-term support and value.
