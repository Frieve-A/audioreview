## Overview

The Topping D30Pro is a desktop DAC equipped with four Cirrus Logic CS43198 chips. When launched in 2020, it garnered attention for its four-chip differential design and 399 USD price point. It incorporates an XMOS XU208 USB receiver chip and supports high-resolution audio up to DSD256 and PCM 32bit/384kHz. The fully balanced design features both XLR and RCA outputs with built-in preamp functionality. While now discontinued, it remains recognized as a product that demonstrated transparent-level performance in acoustic measurements.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measurement performance is exceptionally excellent, significantly surpassing transparent levels across all major indicators. THD+N achieves 0.00009%, far below the transparent level baseline of 0.01%, while S/N ratio reaches 132dB for XLR output and 127dB for RCA output, substantially exceeding the 105dB baseline. Frequency response measures ±0.1dB across 20Hz-20kHz, well within the ±0.5dB standard, and crosstalk achieves -145dB for XLR and -116dB for RCA outputs, far surpassing the -70dB baseline. Dynamic range also meets 132dB (XLR), exceeding the 105dB standard, demonstrating measurement results that achieve completely transparent audio quality for human hearing.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The fully balanced configuration using four CS43198 chips was advanced for its launch period. The differential design combining each chip with I/V conversion circuits achieved theoretical S/N ratio improvements. Support for 32bit/384kHz PCM and DSD256 via XMOS XU208 also demonstrated high technical standards of the time. However, from today's perspective, designs using single higher-performance DAC chips or newer USB receiver chips exist, relatively diminishing the technical advantages. While the design philosophy was rational, methods to achieve equivalent performance more efficiently have now been established.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Against the 399 USD price, the SMSL D6S offering equivalent or superior functionality and measurement performance is available for 199 USD. The D6S demonstrates THD+N of 0.00006% (-124dB), S/N ratio of 129dB (XLR), and frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz ±0.1dB or better, matching or exceeding D30Pro's measurement performance. It includes balanced XLR output, RCA output, and preamp functionality with no inferior user-facing features. Calculation: 199 USD ÷ 399 USD = 0.498, rounding to 0.5. However, since the D30Pro is discontinued with current market prices of 200-250 USD for used units, its competitiveness in the current market is even more limited. With new alternatives available at roughly half the price that achieve D30Pro's functionality and performance, cost-performance receives an average evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Topping is known as a reliable manufacturer focused on measurement-driven product development. The D30Pro itself has no reports of serious quality issues, ensuring basic reliability. However, being a discontinued product raises concerns about continuity of official support and repair services. The standard warranty period was one year, but purchasing new units is now difficult. While the manufacturer's technical support system is good, limitations in product availability and after-sales support result in an industry-average evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The scientific approach aimed at improving measurement performance is highly commendable. The differential design using four DAC chips has theoretical justification, with effects confirmed in actual measurement results. There are no occult claims or unscientific features, representing a design philosophy purely focused on improving audio transparency. The integration of preamp functionality and balanced outputs demonstrates rational feature selection emphasizing practicality. However, equivalent performance can now be achieved more efficiently with single-chip designs, relatively reducing the necessity of the four-chip configuration. Nevertheless, the measurement-focused design philosophy remains consistent, demonstrating a rational product development approach.

## Advice

While the D30Pro is technically excellent, it cannot be recommended given current market conditions. Discontinuation makes new units difficult to obtain, and it is typically priced between 200 and 400 USD on the used market. The SMSL D6S, offering equivalent measurement performance and balanced outputs, is available new for 199 USD with an assured warranty and support. For those prioritizing audio transparency, choosing currently available equivalent products is advisable. Except for collector value or specific reasons to seek the D30Pro, selections considering current technical standards and pricing are recommended. When choosing measurement-focused DACs, comprehensive judgment including availability and pricing is important.
