## Overview

The Topping DX3 Pro+ is a desktop DAC and headphone amplifier featuring the ESS ES9038Q2M DAC chip. It improves THD+N by 60% compared to the previous DX3 Pro model, achieving ultra-low distortion performance of 0.00015%. With 1800mW@32Ω high-output headphone amplification, Bluetooth 5.0 LDAC support, and USB compatibility up to 768kHz/DSD512, it provides comprehensive functionality in the 199 USD price range.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer-rated THD+N is 0.00015%, SNR 122dB, and frequency response 20Hz–20kHz (±0.3dB) [1][2]. With 1800mW into 32Ω, most headphones can be adequately driven. As comprehensive third‑party datasets are limited, we set the score to 0.7 based on published specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ES9038Q2M is a solid choice, and the measurement‑oriented NFCA amp achieves low distortion and noise [1]. The Bluetooth path feeding the main DAC and high‑rate USB support (PCM up to 768kHz/DSD512) are reasonable implementations for the class [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Under the conditions of an all‑in‑one USB DAC/headphone amp with built‑in Bluetooth (LDAC) and spec performance exceeding transparent levels, we could not confirm any strictly equivalent or better product below 199 USD globally. At 199 USD, DX3 Pro+ is effectively among the cheapest meeting these conditions, so cost‑performance is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While Topping has a strong track record in measured performance, community reports note reliability incidents on some past models. Warranty is typically 1 year via dealers/agents. Overall we set slightly below average at 0.6.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Prioritizing measurable performance (THD+N, SNR, FR) toward transparent reproduction is rational. Routing Bluetooth to the main DAC, pursuit of ultra‑low distortion, and four output modes (HP/DAC/HP+Line/Pre) represent sensible investment for audible benefits [1].

## Advice

The DX3 Pro+ is suitable for users seeking measured performance that significantly exceeds transparent levels at 199 USD. As a high-quality DAC and headphone amplifier for desktop use, it can be expected to provide sound quality improvements based on scientific evidence. In the same price range, the FiiO K7 offers balanced output and higher power, but the DX3 Pro+ can also drive the majority of headphones with its single-ended 1800mW@32Ω output. It is recommended as an excellent choice in the 199 USD price range for users prioritizing measured performance.
