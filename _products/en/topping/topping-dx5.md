## Overview

The original Topping DX5 is a compact desktop DAC/headphone amp built around dual ESS ES9068AS DACs and an NFCA-based headphone stage. It provides USB/optical/coaxial inputs, balanced/unbalanced line outputs, and practical headphone outputs aimed at users seeking lab-grade transparency on a desk. The model has since been superseded in the lineup by the **DX5 II (299 USD)**, but this review evaluates the original DX5[8][9].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Audio Science Review measured the DX5 achieving the **fourth-highest SINAD ever** among ~400 DACs at the time[1]. Manufacturer specs list **THD+N 0.00009%**, **dynamic range 128 dB**, and **noise < 2 µVrms**[3]. Independent testing at L7 Audio Lab also shows **~122 dB SINAD**, corroborating its excellence[2]. Minor notes include the typical **ESS IMD hump** and **Toslink jitter** observations[1], neither affecting audible transparency in normal use.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

A dual-DAC balanced architecture with a low-noise NFCA headphone stage and USB support up to **PCM 32-bit/768 kHz** and **DSD512** delivers state-of-the-art measurements[3]. While not a radical new topology, the analog and digital implementation is meticulously optimized to reach transparent-level performance.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As the **cheapest equivalent** one-box option with matching **functions** (balanced 4.4 mm/6.35 mm headphone outs, **Bluetooth with LDAC**, balanced line out) and **transparent-level measurements**, the **SMSL C200** is selected as the comparator[4][5][6]. Its prevailing US price is **219 USD** versus **449 USD** for the DX5:

**219 USD ÷ 449 USD = 0.487… → 0.5**[5][6].

Third-party data and published specs indicate **≈0.0001% THD+N (–120 dB) class** and **≈123 dB DR**, satisfying transparency[5][10]. Therefore, while the DX5 measures superbly, cheaper alternatives providing the same user-visible capabilities constrain its price advantage.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Build quality is solid with a well-finished aluminum chassis. Warranty and after-sales support via authorized dealers are in line with industry norms. As the original DX5 trends toward end-of-life in retail channels, buyers should confirm seller warranty terms and consider long-term parts availability[8][9].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The DX5 pursues **audible transparency** through measurable improvements—low THD+N/SINAD, high dynamic range, and stable frequency response—rather than subjective tuning. This measurement-first approach is rational. Price rationality is tempered by the existence of equally transparent, feature-matched devices at lower prices.

## Advice

If you want **transparent, measurement-driven** desktop listening with both balanced/unbalanced outputs in a single unit, the DX5 remains excellent. For new purchases, consider the **DX5 II (299 USD)** for better price/performance in the same family, or the **SMSL C200** if minimizing cost while retaining features (balanced HP out, Bluetooth) is the priority[6][8][9]. Existing DX5 owners can confidently keep it—its measured performance is already at the top tier.
