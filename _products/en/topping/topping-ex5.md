summary: "DAC/headphone amp combo with dual ES9038Q2M and NFCA. Transparent measured performance and rich I/O (LDAC BT, XLR line out), but value is pressured by cheaper peers if you don’t need every feature."

## Overview

The Topping EX5 is a desktop DAC/headphone amplifier featuring dual ES9038Q2M DACs and Topping’s NFCA amp stage. It adds Bluetooth 5.0 with LDAC, USB/coax/optical inputs, RCA and XLR line outputs, and front 6.35 mm plus 4-pin XLR headphone jacks. It supports up to PCM 768 kHz/32-bit, DSD512, and full MQA decoding[2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent measurements (Audio Science Review) place the EX5’s DAC section in the transparent range (distortion/noise below audibility)[1]. Manufacturer specs list THD at 0.00010% and SNR at 125 dB; headphone output is rated at up to 1.3 W into 32 Ω and 140 mW into 300 Ω[2]. The front 4-pin XLR jack is provided for connector convenience; output power is the same as the 6.35 mm jack (not a higher-power “balanced” drive)[1]. Balanced line-out level is 4.3 Vrms at 0 dBFS[3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

EX5 uses proven, modern parts (dual ES9038Q2M, NFCA) and implements comprehensive connectivity including LDAC BT and MQA[2][3]. Execution is solid but evolutionary rather than groundbreaking.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Using a representative street price of **350 USD**, a cheaper **equivalent-or-better** option is **SMSL C200 Pro** at **199 USD**. It offers LDAC BT, balanced line out (TRS), dual headphone outs (6.35 mm/4.4 mm), and extremely low THD+N (Line Out 0.00006%, HPA 0.00009%); overall user-visible functions and measured performance are on par or better (note: no MQA)[4].  
**CP (USD basis)**: 199 USD ÷ 350 USD = **0.568** → **0.6**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Topping has wide distribution and typical warranty coverage. While long-term EX5-specific reliability data is limited, build and QC are consistent with recent Topping desktop units.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design targets audible transparency via modern ΔΣ conversion and low-noise amplification, plus pragmatic I/O (XLR/RCA, LDAC BT). MQA support adds format compatibility but is unlikely to change audibility for most listeners.

## Advice

Choose the EX5 if you specifically want **LDAC BT, XLR line out, dual front headphone jacks, and MQA** in one box. If MQA is unnecessary, **SMSL C200 Pro** delivers similar or better measured performance and comparable features (BT, balanced line out, dual HP outs) for less money[4]. Also note the EX5’s 4-pin XLR headphone jack does **not** provide more power than the 6.35 mm jack[1].
