## Overview

The Topping E4X4-PRE is a 4-input, 4-output USB audio interface developed by Chinese company Topping. The company has gained attention in recent years for DAC and amplifier products focused on measurement performance, and this product applies that technical expertise to the recording equipment field. It features 24bit/192kHz support, dual USB-C connectivity, and proprietary ultra-linear microphone preamplifiers, designed for professional recording environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measurement performance is extremely excellent, achieving THD+N -110dB (0.0003%), S/N ratio 115dB, frequency response 20Hz-40kHz (±0.2dB), and crosstalk -140dB for microphone inputs. Line inputs/outputs and headphone outputs similarly achieve performance levels far exceeding transparency, making auditory degradation virtually undetectable. The dynamic range of 115-118dB significantly surpasses the transparent level (105dB or higher) in our measurement criteria table, and crosstalk performance of -120 to -140dB is extremely good. These measured values demonstrate that the device almost perfectly achieves the transparency scientifically required of an audio interface and can be rated very highly.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

It incorporates four proprietary ultra-linear microphone preamplifier modules, achieving low-noise design with -130.5dBu EIN. The basic design meets industry average standards with maximum +17dBu gain and 580mW×2@32Ω high-output headphone amplifier. However, technical uniqueness and innovation are limited, with no notable technical advantages compared to competing products in the same class. Dual USB-C connectivity and real-time monitoring functions remain at standard implementation levels, with no breakthrough technological elements identified.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Against the current market price of 266 USD, the MOTU M4 (220 USD) exists with equivalent functionality and measurement performance. The MOTU M4 features ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC technology, boasting excellent measurement performance in the -110dB THD+N class, making it comparable to this product. It is also equivalent as a 4-input, 4-output USB audio interface. The calculation is: 220 USD ÷ 266 USD = 0.827, which rounds to 0.8. Comparing it with cheaper products with inferior measurement performance (e.g., Behringer UMC404HD) is not appropriate under this site's policy.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While Topping products receive high ratings for measurement performance, there are concerns regarding reliability. Quality control issues have been reported across multiple products, including L30 problems, PA5 board cracking due to thermal expansion, and initial defects in E30 and PA3. The rapid product release pace may be affecting quality control, and firmware issues (such as EX5 automatic shutdown problems) have been confirmed. The warranty period is short at one year, and with no local service centers in many regions, repairs require return shipping to China, resulting in high shipping cost burdens.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While the pursuit of measurement performance is scientifically rational, its development process raises significant concerns. The company releases new products at an extremely fast pace, a cycle that has been noted to sacrifice quality control, firmware stability, and the assurance of long-term product support. A business model that favors launching successive new products over the long-term refinement of a single product must be deemed to have low rationality from the perspective of sustainability and reliability required for professional recording equipment.

## Advice

For those considering a 4-input, 4-output USB audio interface, we first recommend considering the MOTU M4 (220 USD). It offers extremely high measurement performance comparable to the Topping E4X4-PRE at a lower price, with a reputation for quality drivers and stable operation. The justification for choosing the Topping E4X4-PRE (266 USD) is currently difficult to find, as the price difference is not warranted by a significant advantage, and concerns about limited warranty support and reliability suggest a more cautious approach. For professional applications, prioritizing long-term stability, reliability, and support over marginal spec differences is prudent.
