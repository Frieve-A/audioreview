## Overview

The Canare L-4E6S is a star-quad microphone cable widely used in professional audio for more than four decades. It uses four 24 AWG conductors (0.20 mm²) arranged in a quad geometry with a high-density braided shield, cotton fillers for handling noise control, and irradiated PE insulation for durability and flexibility. Each conductor is 40 strands of 0.08 mm annealed copper. These features target magnetic-field noise rejection in balanced lines. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Star-quad topology provides a documented reduction of magnetically induced interference—typically on the order of ~20–30 dB compared with standard two-conductor balanced mic cable, with some guidance citing up to tens of dB more depending on conditions. [2][3] Manufacturer specifications list L-4E6S capacitance at 150 pF/m (conductor–conductor) and 185 pF/m (conductor–shield). [1] Competing quad cable Mogami W2534 specifies a balanced quad capacitance of 97 pF/m (cond–cond) and 110 pF/m (cond–shield), i.e., materially lower than L-4E6S. [4] The result is a real, measurable trade-off: strong magnetic-field rejection versus higher capacitance loading. On typical mic runs the HF roll-off remains well above the audio band, but the higher capacitive load can increase stress on some source stages; therefore the effect is meaningful yet context-dependent.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The L-4E6S implements a long-established professional solution (star-quad geometry with braided shield) rather than novel signal-processing or materials science. Canare’s execution—irradiated PE dielectric, dense braid, fine-strand copper—reflects solid industrial design and manufacturing quality, but the core approach is mature. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market pricing for L-4E6S is 0.59 USD/ft (cut length). [5] We searched for equal-or-better alternatives offering the same user-visible function (star-quad mic cable with braided/double shield designed for flexible use) and comparable or better measured electrical performance. Gotham GAC-4/1, a double-shielded star-quad with lower quad-system capacitance (≈135 pF/m side-circuit), is 1.09 USD/ft. [6][7] No cheaper equivalent-or-better option was identified at this time, so the L-4E6S is the cheapest path to the same function/performance set; CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

L-4E6S has long-term adoption in broadcast, touring, and installation. Canare specifies features aimed at durability (fine-strand copper, flexible jacket, cotton fillers) and environmental robustness, and distribution is global through multiple pro-audio channels. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design prioritizes magnetic-field rejection through geometry (rational, measurement-based) at the expense of higher capacitance than some rivals. Given that better-engineered quads attain lower capacitance while preserving EMI benefits, the approach is scientifically grounded but not fully optimized for lowest loading. [1][4]

## Advice

Choose L-4E6S when magnetic-field rejection and pro-grade flexibility are priorities at minimum cost (stage boxes near dimmers, long mic feeds near power). If you routinely run very long lines from high-impedance or sensitive sources, lower-capacitance quads like Mogami W2534 mitigate capacitive loading while still providing substantial magnetic-field immunity, albeit at higher price. [4][5]
