## Overview

$$ \Large \text{4.0} $$

The OLLO Audio X1 represents the company's flagship studio monitoring headphones, launched in October 2024. Featuring custom 50mm drivers with a patented composite Pu+PET membrane and a semi-open design optimized for professional mixing and mastering. Each unit includes individual AI-powered calibration through USC II software with three target curves. Construction utilizes premium materials including handbuilt American walnut housings, aluminum, and stainless steel components. At 539 USD, the X1 targets professional audio engineers seeking precision monitoring with advanced calibration capabilities.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The X1 demonstrates excellent measured performance. Official specs state THD & 2nd harmonic <0.05% & <0.02% at 94 dB SPL (1 kHz) measured on an IEC 60318-1 ear simulator, and frequency range 5 Hz–22 kHz with 1/3-octave peak-to-peak variation of ~9.8 dB SPL (±1 dB). Sensitivity is specified at 101 dB SPL @ 1 kHz (0 dBu). Third-party measurements (DIY-Audio-Heaven) confirm very good linearity across SPLs with minimal compression and resonances. OLLO also publishes a measurements report based on IEC 60318-1/-4 ear simulator standards. These indicators collectively support transparent-level performance for studio monitoring. [1][2][3][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The X1 integrates multiple advanced elements: an in-house 50 mm driver using a patented composite Pu+PET diaphragm pattern, individualized AI calibration via USC II (with studio/FOH/car emulations powered by Realphones), and a repairable, premium build. This digital-analog integration and production approach represent a high technology level for the category. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Market price (X1): **539 USD**.  
To satisfy equal-or-better *function & measured monitoring performance* **with over-ear headphones**, the **AKG K371** qualifies: independent measurements show **very good target compliance** with **low harmonic distortion** and **frequency-response standard deviation ≈1.27 dB** (RTINGS Test Bench 2.0). Typical lowest widely available price is **119 USD**.  
**CP = 119 ÷ 539 = 0.22.**  
While the K371 is closed-back (vs the X1’s semi-open), its objective accuracy and low distortion meet the core monitoring function at a substantially lower price. [5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

OLLO provides a **5-year limited warranty**. For the first two years, repairs (excluding cable and earpads) and round-trip shipping are covered; subsequent years cover repairs with shipping excluded. The product is designed for user-serviceability with readily available spare parts. A **90-day trial** is also offered. This is a robust support profile in the professional headphone segment. [1][7][8]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The design prioritizes measurable neutrality and repeatability using IEC-compliant fixtures, individual unit calibration, and a fully serviceable construction. Investment is directed toward monitoring performance rather than consumer features, aligning with professional use cases. [1][2]

## Advice

The X1 suits engineers who value individualized calibration, semi-open presentation, and long-term serviceability. If you need the tightest unit-to-unit consistency in an over-ear format plus included calibration tools, the X1 makes sense. If your priority is *the lowest price for equal-or-better measurable monitoring accuracy* in **over-ear headphones**, the **AKG K371** achieves that goal at significantly lower cost. [5][6]
