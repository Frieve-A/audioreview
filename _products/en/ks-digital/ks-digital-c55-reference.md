## Overview

The KS Digital C55 Reference is a compact 2.5-way coaxial monitor: a 5.5-inch coaxial mid/tweeter (1-inch silk dome) plus a dedicated 5.5-inch woofer in a point-source layout. Processing is handled by FIRTEC filters on an FPGA with 24-bit/192 kHz AD/DA. Connectivity includes balanced XLR analog and AES3 digital input; six user EQs are available via the optional KSD_RC remote. Claimed system power is 350 W per speaker, with a 12.2 kg enclosure sized 400 × 200 × 240 mm [1][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specifications state 35 Hz–22 kHz frequency response (±3 dB) and **>108 dB peak SPL per pair** [1][3]. A professional review reports **no work-relevant latency** on C55 and notes the related C88 measures **well under 5 ms**, alongside **very low self-noise**; however, controlled third-party distortion and directivity data for C55 are not yet public [2]. Given speakers’ category notes (±3 dB within band is standard) and limited independent data on THD/directivity, the evidence supports solid but provisional neutrality, hence 0.7.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The C55 employs a coaxial point-source topology with **phase-linear FIR** crossover and room-tuning EQs in an FPGA (FIRTEC). AES3 input and 24-bit/192 kHz conversion reflect current practice, and the coaxial geometry targets time/phase coherence [1][3]. While sophisticated, these are evolutionary implementations relative to class leaders with elaborate directivity control and ecosystem software; thus 0.7.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Verified current market price for C55 Reference is **1,755 USD (each)** [3]. The **cheapest equivalent-or-better** alternative we identify is **Neumann KH 150** at **1,750 USD (each)** with DSP room alignment, digital I/O (S/PDIF/AES67 variant), linear response **39 Hz–21 kHz (±3 dB)** and high max-SPL ratings (e.g., **108.8 dB, 3% THD 100 Hz–10 kHz**) [4][5][6]. Rationale: functionally comparable (pro DSP, digital input, tuning) and measured performance on core axes (FR linearity, max level) is equivalent-or-better.  
**Calculation (required disclosure):** 1,750 USD ÷ 1,755 USD = **0.997** → first-decimal score **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

KS Digital builds in Germany and offers DSP protection (limiters/thermal). Retailers such as Thomann provide a **3-year store warranty**, but public failure-rate/MTBF data are scarce [1][3]. Given established pro-audio presence yet limited transparent reliability metrics, 0.8 is appropriate.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design explicitly targets measurable improvements—coaxial point-source radiation and **phase-linear FIR** crossovers—to reduce time/phase error and off-axis anomalies rather than adding coloration [1][2]. This focus aligns strongly with transparent monitoring goals; 0.9.

## Advice

C55 Reference suits engineers prioritizing point-source imaging with compact footprint and digital/AES3 workflows. If you want **documented third-party measurements and auto-alignment**, the **Neumann KH 150** is compelling at a slightly lower price, with extensive published data and MA 1 calibration [4][5][6]. If you specifically seek coaxial point-source with a mature room ecosystem, **Genelec 8331A** offers that with GLM integration and rich independent data, but at a substantially higher price and lower max-SPL rating per unit (short-term 104 dB) [7][8]. The C55 remains attractive for users valuing its FIRTEC approach and AES3 input at its price.
