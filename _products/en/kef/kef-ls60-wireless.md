## Overview

KEF LS60 Wireless is a wireless floorstanding speaker launched to commemorate the company's 60th anniversary. The innovative design features a Uni-Q driver equipped with Meta technology combined with proprietary UniCore technology, incorporating four woofers in an ultra-slim 13cm wide cabinet. The 1400W internal amplifier and DSP processing achieve wide-band reproduction from 26Hz to 36kHz.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The performance evaluation based on measurement data shows excellent results. The frequency response achieves ±3dB within 31Hz-24kHz, with extended performance of -6dB from 26Hz-36kHz. The maximum SPL of 111dB provides sufficient sound pressure levels, meeting transparency level standards. Meta technology's 99% absorption of tweeter rear sound waves demonstrates measurable distortion reduction effects, while SmartDistortion Control technology realizes dynamic distortion correction. The low-frequency range below 40Hz shows a 12dB/octave attenuation characteristic due to the sealed design, which is a reasonable performance within its physical constraints.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

It boasts extremely high technical levels. UniCore technology is a patented technology that drives two coaxially arranged drivers with a common motor system, significantly improving upon conventional force-cancellation designs. Meta technology is an innovative sound absorption technology using acoustic metamaterials, representing the industry's first practical implementation. The advanced DSP processing through Music Integrity Engine integrates low-frequency phase correction, dynamic EQ, and time alignment, achieving 1400W output through an optimal combination of Class-AB and Class-D amplifiers. The deep bass reproduction in the 13cm wide ultra-slim cabinet represents a pinnacle of design engineering.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The cost-performance is moderate. Priced at approximately 6,999 USD, a comparable alternative in terms of wireless functionality and acoustic performance is the B&W Formation Duo with its dedicated stands, which costs around 4,500 USD. The calculation is 4,500 USD ÷ 6,999 USD = 0.64. While the Formation Duo is a bookshelf speaker, there are few other products that offer a similar integrated floorstanding design and feature set, making it the closest competitor. Considering the convenience of its all-in-one design and superior low-frequency performance from its four-driver configuration, the LS60 Wireless presents a reasonable, albeit not exceptional, value proposition.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Reliability and support are at an industry-standard level, though with some caveats. The warranty covers electronic components for 2 years and drivers for 5 years, which is comparable to or better than the 1-2 year warranties offered by competitors. However, the warranty is non-transferable and applies only to the original purchaser, which could affect its resale value. Firmware updates are performed automatically, which is convenient but limits user control over software versions. These factors were considered in determining the overall score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design philosophy presents a mix of innovation and challenges. The use of a DSP-driven active design and proprietary technologies like Uni-Core to achieve wide-band reproduction from a slim cabinet is highly rational, overcoming physical size limitations. However, policies such as the non-transferable warranty and mandatory automatic firmware updates suggest a prioritization of administrative convenience over long-term product value and user ownership experience. This lack of consideration for consumer interests significantly lowers the rationality score.

## Advice

The KEF LS60 Wireless is a compelling option for users seeking to experience cutting-edge acoustic technology with ease. Its slim design offers great placement flexibility. Compared to alternatives like the B&W Formation Duo (approx. 4,500 USD with stands), the 6,999 USD price is a premium, but may be justified by the convenience of its integrated floorstanding design. However, the non-transferable warranty is a drawback for those who consider future resale. It is recommended to weigh these factors, particularly the long-term support and ownership experience, before making a purchase.
