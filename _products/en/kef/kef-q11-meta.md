## Overview

The KEF Q11 Meta represents the flagship model in KEF's Q-series lineup, featuring the company's 12th generation Uni-Q driver array combined with Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT). This 3-way floorstanding speaker incorporates a 4-inch Uni-Q driver alongside three 6.5-inch hybrid aluminum bass drivers, targeting audiophiles seeking refined performance in larger listening spaces. The Q11 Meta builds upon KEF's established coaxial driver heritage while introducing meta-material tweeter absorption technology previously reserved for higher-end models.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third‑party measurements confirm objectively solid behavior. Using Klippel NFS under CTA‑2034 methodology, on‑axis and listening‑window responses are well controlled with smooth directivity; sensitivity is 89 dB (2.83 V/1 m), nominal impedance 4 Ω (minimum 3.2 Ω), maximum output 113 dB, and rated frequency response is 44 Hz–20 kHz (±3 dB) with a –6 dB extension to 37 Hz [1][2]. KEF specifies harmonic distortion at 90 dB/1 m as <1% from 31 Hz–20 kHz and <2% from 29 Hz upward [2]. These figures align with modern passive floorstander transparency targets above bass, while bass distortion rises as expected at higher SPL. Measurement conditions on the cited third‑party review: reference at tweeter height, grille off, CTA‑2034 data presentation [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

12th‑generation Uni‑Q with MAT is a rational, incremental platform: coaxial geometry for coherent radiation and predictable directivity, plus a metamaterial absorber behind the tweeter to suppress rear radiation resonances [2]. The crossover topology and hybrid aluminum woofers are conventional for a 3‑way tower. Overall, this is solid engineering with incremental innovation rather than a step‑change.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market price is approximately 2,100–2,200 USD per pair as of the third‑party review timeline [1]. As a concrete comparator, Polk Audio Reserve R700 shows comparable CTA‑2034 linearity and directivity and is noted at approximately 2,200 USD per pair in the cited review [3]. No cheaper equivalent‑or‑better option was identified; therefore CP=1.0 per policy.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Build quality is consistent with KEF’s mainstream passive towers, using proven drivers and cabinet construction. Warranty and after‑sales terms vary by region (example: Japan site indicates 2‑year warranty for passive speakers) and should be confirmed locally [2]. KEF provides manuals, information sheets and white papers publicly [2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Emphasis on controlled directivity and resonance management is evidence‑based. Uni‑Q addresses driver integration and off‑axis consistency; MAT applies metamaterial absorption to reduce tweeter back‑wave energy. Documentation and measured results align with scientifically rational goals focused on frequency‑response linearity and dispersion rather than non‑verifiable claims [1][2].

## Advice

The KEF Q11 Meta suits listeners who value a coherent radiation pattern and predictable in‑room behavior from a 3‑way floorstander for medium‑to‑large rooms. Ensure amplification stable into 4 Ω loads and allow placement/room treatment to manage bass integration. If you seek measured directivity control with low coloration and do not require DSP/active features, this model is a strong candidate.
