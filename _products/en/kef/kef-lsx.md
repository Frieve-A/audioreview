## Overview

The KEF LSX is a wireless active speaker released by KEF in 2018. It features downsized technology from the company's acclaimed LS50, incorporating a 115mm (4.5-inch) magnesium-aluminum alloy cone and 19mm (0.75-inch) aluminum dome tweeter in a Uni-Q driver array designed as a compact desktop speaker. It supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 with aptX, and wired connections (RJ45 Ethernet, TosLink optical, 3.5mm analog), with operation possible through the dedicated "KEF Control" app. Each speaker features Class D amplifiers (30W for tweeter, 70W for woofer) in a bi-amp configuration. Originally priced at 1,099 USD, it targets the premium desktop audio market. Despite its compact size, it concentrates KEF's acoustic technology into a notable product.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The KEF LSX's acoustic characteristics can be highly evaluated based on measurement data. The 115mm Uni-Q driver's point source characteristics achieve excellent soundstage positioning and phase characteristics. Frequency response covers 49Hz-47kHz (-6dB), with settings adjustable from 54Hz-28kHz (-3dB, more bass) to 69Hz-28kHz (-3dB, less bass). Port resonance frequency is set at 58Hz. Analog input latency measures approximately 48ms. The Uni-Q driver's coaxial arrangement solves phase problems at crossover frequencies that occur in conventional multi-way speakers, with step response showing "almost perfect positive-polarity, time-coincident, right-triangle shape." The cumulative spectral decay plot is evaluated as "superbly clean." These measurements confirm the effectiveness of KEF's acoustic engineering in a compact form factor.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The KEF LSX effectively miniaturizes technology developed in the company's high-end products. The Uni-Q driver array represents a technically superior approach with its unique coaxial design placing the tweeter at the woofer's center, achieving point source characteristics. DSP-based crossover design and room correction functions demonstrate rational acoustic design for the digital era. The bi-amp configuration with dedicated Class D amplifiers (30W for tweeter, 70W for woofer) for each driver enables efficient operation. Cabinet design is well-considered with optimized internal volume and resonance control. Wireless connectivity implementation is technically appropriate, supporting multiple codecs. However, the design remains within conventional dynamic driver parameters, representing skillful combination of existing technologies rather than revolutionary innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Against the KEF LSX's original price of 1,099 USD, products offering equivalent performance across all key dimensions (Uni-Q acoustic technology, comprehensive wireless connectivity, compact form factor, and app control) are extremely limited. The primary equivalent is the KEF LS50 Wireless II (2,500-3,000 USD), which offers superior acoustic performance (12th gen Uni-Q with MAT) but at more than double the price. Products like Sonos Five (549 USD) or Audioengine HD6 (699 USD) provide wireless functionality but lack the acoustic sophistication of Uni-Q technology. The KEF LSX II LT (999 USD, 2024), while similar, offers reduced functionality (no Roon Ready, no MQA) making it a simplified variant rather than equivalent. As the most affordable product combining true audiophile acoustic performance with comprehensive wireless functionality, CP = 1,099 รท 1,099 = 1.0, reflecting LSX's position as the value leader in its category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

KEF, as an established British audio manufacturer, maintains solid quality control and support systems. The LSX, being a relatively new 2018 product still in production, receives warranty and support. Firmware updates are regularly provided with continued feature additions and improvements. The dedicated "KEF Control" app receives continuous updates for operational improvements. Electronic component reliability as an active speaker maintains general industry standards. However, internal amplifier failure would require entire cabinet repair, creating higher long-term usage risks compared to passive speakers. The global brand's support network is established with minimal parts supply concerns.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design concept of compact active speakers for the desktop audio market represents a rational approach suited to modern lifestyles. Pursuing point source characteristics through Uni-Q drivers is acoustically sound design philosophy. DSP-based acoustic characteristic optimization represents a modern approach transcending analog circuit limitations. Wireless connectivity implementation rationally balances cable-free convenience with sound quality. The integration of multiple connectivity options (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, wired) in a compact form factor addresses real-world usage scenarios effectively. While miniaturization creates physical constraints, the achieved frequency response characteristics remain within acceptable speaker engineering tolerances. The 1,099 USD pricing, while premium, represents competitive value considering the comprehensive feature set and acoustic performance achieved in the compact form factor. The design philosophy successfully optimizes the balance between size constraints, modern connectivity needs, and acoustic performance.

## Advice

The KEF LSX offers value as a product balancing desktop audio convenience with consistent acoustic performance. The ability to experience KEF's acoustic technology in compact size is particularly attractive. It merits consideration when prioritizing wireless connectivity convenience, app operation, and design aesthetics. For equivalent wireless functionality, alternatives include the Sonos Five (549 USD) with Wi-Fi connectivity, though lacking the Uni-Q driver technology, and the Audioengine HD6 (699 USD) with Bluetooth and optical inputs. The Klipsch The Fives (sub-1,000 USD) offers HDMI-ARC connectivity for TV integration. **Note that the original KEF LSX (2018) is now discontinued and has been succeeded by the LSX II LT (999 USD), which offers similar acoustic performance with updated connectivity including HDMI, enhanced Wi-Fi, and improved DSP.** For professional music production applications, selecting dedicated monitors remains recommended. When considering purchase, comprehensive evaluation of usage environment, size constraints, and convenience requirements is essential.
