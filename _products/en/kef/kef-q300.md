## Overview

The KEF Q300 is a 2-way bass-reflex bookshelf speaker announced in 2011. It features a 6.5-inch aluminum Uni-Q driver array with a 1-inch vented aluminum dome tweeter placed coaxially. This patented Uni-Q design from KEF aims for ideal acoustic characteristics by positioning the tweeter at the acoustic center of the woofer to create a point source. The speaker received high acclaim upon its release, including the Product of the Year award from the British magazine What Hi-Fi? in 2011. It is now discontinued and has been replaced by the successor model, the Q350.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

From a scientific fidelity perspective, there are concerns due to limited data. Key factors for speaker evaluation are frequency response flatness and directivity uniformity. The Uni-Q driver theoretically provides stable imaging and a wide sweet spot via coaxial alignment.

However, comprehensive third-party measurements like Spinorama are lacking for this model. Available data from HomeTheaterHifi shows THD+N at 100 dB: 0.80% at 1kHz, 0.33% at 250Hz, and 0.52% at 10kHz, indicating moderate distortion at high volumes (below 1% threshold for problem level in speakers). Frequency response measurements from independent sources suggest ±2 dB variation in treble and a midbass bump, with -3 dB at around 50 Hz, meeting standard ±3 dB criteria but not excellent. Off-axis response is relatively flat, supporting directivity claims. Sensitivity is 87 dB, and impedance is 8 Ω nominal. Without full data to confirm advantages, scientific assessment remains moderate.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Uni-Q driver array demonstrates technical ingenuity in its coaxial design, improving phase alignment in the crossover band and reducing position dependency. This was advanced for 2011, but coaxial technologies are now more widespread, diminishing relative uniqueness. Measurement data does not fully substantiate the philosophy, and absence of modern DSP highlights limitations from a current perspective.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

As of August 2025, the average used market price is 155 USD. Comparable current models include the Q Acoustics 3020i at 265 USD and ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 at around 386 USD. Calculation (lowest competitor price / product price): 265 USD ÷ 155 USD = 1.71, capped at 1.0. This discontinued model offers high value on the used market compared to similar-function speakers, though warranty limitations apply.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

KEF, founded in 1961, is a reputable British speaker brand. However, as the Q300 is discontinued, official warranty and repairs are unavailable. Support relies on third-party services. With the active brand and successor Q350, parts availability is possible but uncertain, typical risks for used products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The KEF Q300 is available at attractive used prices. The Uni-Q technology provides unique point-source characteristics, offering flexibility in listening positions. However, the absence of detailed measurements to prove acoustic performance is a drawback, and distortion data indicates limits at high volumes.

## Advice

For budget-conscious users attracted to KEF's characteristics, this is a viable option. Those prioritizing warranty and verified performance should consider current models like Q150 or Q350. For applications requiring high frequency accuracy, such as music production, select products with superior measurements.
