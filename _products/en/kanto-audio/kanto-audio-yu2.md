summary: "Tiny powered desktop speakers with a built-in USB DAC (16-bit/48kHz), AUX input and subwoofer out. Manufacturer-rated 80Hz–20kHz ±6dB response signals limited neutrality; comprehensive third-party full-band measurements are scarce. Engineering is sensible for the size, reliability/support are standard, and cost-performance is slightly below neutral given cheaper equivalent options (PreSonus Eris E3.5 plus a low-cost USB-C DAC)."

## Overview

YU2 is a compact 2-way powered desktop speaker featuring a 3/4-inch silk-dome tweeter, 3-inch Kevlar woofer and a Class-D amp rated at 25W RMS per channel. It provides USB audio (16-bit/48kHz), a 3.5mm AUX input and a subwoofer output (manufacturer specs) [1]. The enclosure measures roughly W100 × H150 × D135 mm. Current US direct price is **299.99 USD**; Japan domestic price is **37,800円** via the distributor’s shop [2][7].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Public full-range third-party measurements (e.g., spin/NFS) for YU2 are limited at review time. The manufacturer lists **80Hz–20kHz ±6dB** response, indicating a non-flat tonal balance within the band [1]. The integrated USB DAC supports **16-bit/48kHz**, a conventional capability for desktop use [1]. Given limited independent data and the magnitude of the stated response variation, we conservatively set scientific validity to **0.3**, pending robust external measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Packing a 2-way design, Class-D amplification, USB DAC and sub out into a very small cabinet is a sensible implementation for desk use. The 2.5kHz crossover and I/O set match the intended application, though there’s no onboard DSP/autocalibration or novel IP [1]. We set technology level at **0.6**.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Comparator = **cheapest equivalent-or-better** route. **PreSonus Eris E3.5** provides similar user-facing capability (powered 2-way for desk use) and adds tone controls; to match YU2’s USB input, we normalize with Apple’s **USB-C to 3.5mm** DAC dongle. Third-party Klippel NFS/CTA-2034 data exist for the E3.5, allowing response characterization and basic trimming via its onboard controls [3]. Prices: **114.99 USD** (E3.5, Sweetwater) [4] + **9.00 USD** (Apple dongle) [5] = **123.99 USD**. Review target price is **299.99 USD** [2].  
**Computation:** 123.99 USD ÷ 299.99 USD = **0.413** → rounds to **0.4**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Global limited warranty is **24 months** [6]. Japan distributor’s page lists **1-year** warranty for local units [7]. Given the simple active 2-way construction and the mixed warranty terms, reliability/support is **0.6**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design targets “small desk, minimal wiring” with USB/AUX and a sub out for extendability. It doesn’t pursue state-of-the-art transparency, but allocating cost to practical I/O and compactness is reasonable; thus **0.7** [1][2].

## Advice

Choose YU2 if you need a very small, tidy USB-connected desktop setup and may add a sub later. Expect modest deep-bass output (roll-off above ~80Hz) and a response not tuned for strict neutrality [1]. If you prioritize adjustability and value, the **PreSonus Eris E3.5 + a low-cost USB-C DAC** is a cheaper, functionally equivalent alternative with third-party data and tone controls for basic response shaping [3][4][5]. Japan buyers should note the 1-year local warranty listing vs the global 24-month policy [7][6].
