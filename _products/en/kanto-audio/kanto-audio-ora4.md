## Overview

ORA4 is a bi-amplified 2-way desktop speaker using a 4-inch aluminum woofer and a 3/4-inch silk-dome tweeter, each driven by its own amplifier. It provides USB-C (24-bit/96kHz), Bluetooth 5.0, and RCA inputs, plus a subwoofer output that triggers an automatic 80Hz high/low-pass crossover. Manufacturer-stated bandwidth is 60Hz–22kHz; output is 70W RMS total (per channel: 23W woofer + 12W tweeter), 140W peak [1]. The design targets creator/desk use with simple wiring and modern I/O.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, comprehensive measurements (anechoic FR, directivity, distortion, max SPL) have not been published yet. Verifiable numeric data currently come from the manufacturer: 60Hz–22kHz bandwidth, USB-C at 24-bit/96kHz, and the automatic 80Hz high/low-pass with a connected sub [1][2]. Without third-party distortion and output data, audible transparency claims remain unproven; score stays at the unknown-baseline 0.5 per available facts.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A sensible integration of bi-amping, DSP, USB-C (24/96), BT 5.0, and auto 80Hz high/low-pass reflects contemporary best practice for compact 2.0 systems [1][2]. No disclosed proprietary algorithms or patents, but the implementation is coherent and slightly above average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Comparator: **Vanatoo Transparent Zero Plus**. It offers the same user-facing functions—USB digital input (24-bit/96kHz), Bluetooth, and a subwoofer output—and has strong third-party measurement backing (Erin’s NFS/CTA-2034 data; e.g., in-room ~52–20kHz ±3dB in Flat mode), so it is judged equivalent-or-better on function/performance [3][4]. As of writing, its current price is **449.99 USD**, the same band as ORA4’s **449.99 USD** [1][3]. **No cheaper equivalent-or-better product is found at this time; hence CP = 1.0.**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Kanto provides a **2-year** limited warranty [5]. With modest mechanical complexity typical of this class and wide retail support [2], reliability/support looks average to slightly above average. No public RMA/MTBF datasets were found; score set to 0.7.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The I/O set (USB-C, BT, RCA) and automatic 80Hz crossover directly address audible, desktop-use needs while avoiding non-scientific add-ons [1][2]. Overall, the cost is focused on functions and behaviors that matter for hearing, indicating a highly rational design.

## Advice

Ideal if you want a minimal, PC-centric setup (single USB-C cable) with a straightforward sub integration. If you value extensive third-party acoustic data at the same price point, **Vanatoo Transparent Zero Plus** is a notable alternative with published NFS/CTA-2034 measurements [3][4]. If you don’t need USB input, an analog-only small monitor plus a basic USB audio interface can lower total spend while retaining usability.
