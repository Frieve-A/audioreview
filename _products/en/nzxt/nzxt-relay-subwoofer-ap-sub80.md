## Overview

The NZXT Relay Subwoofer AP-SUB80 is a compact 6.5-inch down-firing subwoofer designed to complement NZXT's gaming audio ecosystem. With 140W peak power output and MDF construction, it targets gamers seeking to enhance their desktop audio setup. The subwoofer features adjustable crossover (50-150Hz) and phase controls, RCA connectivity, and a gaming-focused design aesthetic that matches NZXT's broader hardware portfolio.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The AP-SUB80 demonstrates significant limitations in measured performance. The frequency response of 45Hz-150Hz represents a considerably narrow range compared to industry standards, particularly lacking in the critical sub-bass region below 45Hz. The manufacturer-specified THD of <5% at 250Hz is problematic, as this indicates distortion levels far exceeding transparent thresholds. For speakers and subwoofers, THD should ideally be below 0.1% for excellent performance, while values above 1% are considered problematic [1]. The limited frequency range and high distortion specifications place this product well below transparent performance levels in the measurement criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The AP-SUB80 employs conventional technology typical of entry-level subwoofers. The 6.5-inch paper/foam driver, MDF cabinet construction, and basic crossover controls represent industry-standard approaches without notable innovation. While the down-firing configuration and compact form factor are practical for desktop use, these features are common implementations rather than advanced engineering solutions. The power amplification and driver technologies are consistent with industry average levels, showing competent but unremarkable technical execution.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market price is 149.99 USD for the AP-SUB80 [1]. As of this writing, we could not confirm any finished-product subwoofer with equal-or-better user-facing functions (RCA input, adjustable low-pass/phase) and equal-or-better measured performance (frequency extension to at most 45 Hz or lower within the operating band) at a lower current market price. Representative equal-or-better alternatives such as Dayton Audio SUB-1000 (30–140 Hz) and SUB-1200 (25–140 Hz) are available at higher prices (182.98 USD and 199.98 USD, respectively) [2][3]. Therefore, per site policy, CP = 1.0 (no cheaper equivalent-or-better product exists at this time).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

NZXT maintains an established reputation in gaming hardware with standard warranty coverage and support infrastructure. As a relatively new entry in the audio market, long-term reliability data is limited, placing the product at industry average levels. The company's existing support network for gaming hardware provides adequate coverage, though specific audio expertise may be less comprehensive than dedicated audio manufacturers. Build quality appears consistent with gaming peripherals standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design philosophy emphasizes gaming branding over acoustic optimization. The limited 45-150Hz frequency response lacks the sub-bass extension essential for comprehensive low-frequency reproduction, representing a significant compromise in fundamental subwoofer functionality. The 5% THD specification suggests acceptance of distortion levels that would be considered unacceptable in transparent audio reproduction. The gaming-focused marketing without corresponding technical advantages in audible performance reflects an approach that prioritizes aesthetic integration over acoustic excellence. This represents a departure from rational subwoofer design principles focused on accurate bass reproduction.

## Advice

Consider alternatives with superior measured performance and broader frequency response. For example, Dayton Audio SUB-1000 (30–140 Hz) and SUB-1200 (25–140 Hz) deliver objectively deeper extension and greater headroom, albeit at higher prices [2][3]. For gaming applications specifically, prioritize subwoofers with frequency response extending below 40 Hz and THD specifications under 1%. The AP-SUB80 integrates aesthetically with NZXT systems and, cost-wise, is currently the cheapest among equivalent-or-better options; however, if you can stretch budget, the above alternatives yield audibly better bass performance.
