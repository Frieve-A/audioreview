summary: "Vienna Acoustics' flagship 'The Music' features proprietary Flat Spider-Cone technology, but at 45,995 USD/pair (approximately 6.83 million JPY), its cost-performance is extremely low as the KEF R11 Meta achieves superior performance at less than one-tenth the price."

## Overview

Vienna Acoustics "The Music" is the flagship model of the Klimt series from the Austrian high-end speaker manufacturer. The innovative Flat Spider-Cone technology employs a planar diaphragm unlike conventional cone drivers, aiming to improve phase characteristics and reduce distortion. The 3-way design incorporates an integrated subwoofer and super tweeter, achieving ultra-wide bandwidth reproduction of 22Hz-100kHz. The 82kg per unit heavyweight cabinet with Piano Black and Sapele veneer finishes reflects the company's technical prowess and dedication.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Comparison with the measurement criteria table reveals issues across multiple indicators. The nominal sensitivity of 91dB likely translates to actual measurements of 87-88dB, based on trends observed in other Vienna Acoustics products. The 4ฮฉ load presents driving difficulties for many amplifiers, and discrepancies between nominal and measured values affect sound quality. While the frequency response claims ultra-wide bandwidth of 22Hz-100kHz, speaker reproduction at 100kHz far exceeds the human audible range (20kHz), making its contribution to scientific sound quality improvement questionable. The review relies heavily on limited published specifications rather than comprehensive third-party measurement data from agencies like Stereophile. Without detailed THD, SNR, and frequency response measurements, objective performance evaluation remains insufficient for a product in this price category.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Flat Spider-Cone technology represents a distinctive approach that sets it apart from conventional cone drivers, demonstrating technical innovation. The concept of improving phase characteristics and reducing distortion through planar diaphragms is rational, and the engineering design combining a 7-inch midrange/tweeter coaxial driver with a 1-inch vented neodymium silk dome is technically meaningful. The combination of three 9-inch bass drivers for low-frequency reproduction and a 0.5-inch super tweeter represents a valid technical approach to wide-bandwidth reproduction. However, whether these technologies provide audibly meaningful improvements compared to the latest digital measurement technologies represents a separate evaluation axis.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

At 45,995 USD/pair (approximately 6,830,000 JPY), a competing product with equivalent or superior measured performance is the KEF R11 Meta (actual 2025 market price in Japan approx. 990,000 JPY). The comparison yields a calculation of 990,000 JPY รท 6,830,000 JPY = 0.145, resulting in an evaluation score of 0.1. Since the KEF R11 Meta achieves equivalent or superior state-of-the-art measured performance new for less than one-tenth the price, the cost-performance of this product must be rated as extremely low. Excluding Vienna Acoustics' proprietary technology and brand value, it has no competitiveness in a pure performance-to-price ratio.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Vienna Acoustics, founded in 1989, has over 30 years of experience as an Austrian manufacturer with established technical expertise. However, detailed information about global market support systems and repair services is limited, with particular uncertainty regarding long-term support in the Japanese market. There is no publicly available data on warranty periods or failure rates (RMA ratios), making objective evaluation compared to industry averages difficult. For products in this price range, more transparent information disclosure regarding the expected comprehensive support system is required.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

While the Flat Spider-Cone technology's approach to phase characteristic improvement has scientific merit, the necessity of its existence as dedicated audio equipment at a price of approximately 6.83 million JPY is highly questionable. With competing products like the KEF R11 Meta (approx. 990,000 JPY) achieving equivalent or superior measured performance at a far lower cost, there is absolutely no performance advantage demonstrated to justify the price difference. Ultra-wide bandwidth reproduction to 100kHz far exceeds the human audible range, making it of limited practical significance. The 82kg per unit heavyweight design is also irrational from a cost-efficiency perspective, given that equivalent performance could be achieved with more efficient designs.

## Advice

Vienna Acoustics "The Music" is an ambitious product seeking differentiation through proprietary technology, but it is difficult to objectively demonstrate a performance advantage commensurate with its price of approximately 6.83 million JPY. Considering that the KEF R11 Meta, with equivalent or superior measured performance, is available for about 990,000 JPY, the price difference of approximately 5.84 million JPY is for the brand and design. Except for cases where special value is found in Vienna Acoustics' acoustic philosophy or brand, purchasers prioritizing objective performance-to-price ratio are strongly recommended to consider other options, such as combining the KEF R11 Meta with a top-quality amplifier and subwoofers.
