## Overview

The **TASCAM Portacapture X8** is a handheld multitrack recorder supporting **32-bit float** up to **192 kHz**. It provides **four XLR/TRS combo inputs**, a detachable stereo mic configurable for **A-B / true X-Y**, and a **3.5-inch touchscreen** with scene apps (MANUAL / VOICE / PODCAST / MUSIC / FIELD / ASMR). It can also act as a **USB 8-in / 2-out** audio interface.  
Recording supports **up to eight total tracks: six individual tracks plus a stereo mix**; the number of simultaneous **isolated** input tracks is **six** for post-mix editing flexibility [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Manufacturer-published measurable specs (abridged, key items):**

- **Formats / depth / rate**: WAV (BWF) **44.1/48/96/192 kHz**, **16/24-bit or 32-bit float**; MP3 44.1/48 kHz (128/192/256/320 kb/s). **USB audio interface 8-in/2-out**. [2]  
- **Frequency response (JEITA)**, mic inputs to PCM:  
  • 48 kHz: **20 Hz–20 kHz, +0/−0.3 dB**  
  • 192 kHz: **20 Hz–60 kHz, +0.5/−2.5 dB**. [2]  
- **THD+N (1 kHz)**: **0.005%** (mic in 1–2), **0.006%** (mic in 3–6). **S/N up to 109 dB**. [2]  
- **Headphone out**: 45 mW + 45 mW, **built-in speaker** 0.4 W. [2]  
- **Track architecture**: **6 inputs + stereo mix (= 8 total)** at up to 32-bit float / 192 kHz. [1][2]

These values meet **transparent-level** capture criteria on paper (wide bandwidth, low THD+N, high S/N). In line with policy, the absence of **standardized third-party bench datasets** (e.g., independent EIN/SNR sweeps, latency) reduces the score by **0.1**, yielding **0.7**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Dual-A/D 32-bit float capture, detachable capsules, and the touch-first launcher are well executed but common in current handhelds. Workflow improves, yet measured transparency is not uniquely advanced relative to peer **32-bit / 6-track** recorders [3][4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Scope (non-inferior function/performance):** 32-bit float handhelds enabling **six isolated input tracks** (stereo mix where applicable).

- **Baseline (cheapest non-inferior)**: **Zoom H6essential** — 32-bit float, **6 tracks**. [3]  
- **Subject**: **TASCAM Portacapture X8** — 32-bit float, **6 isolated + stereo mix**. [1][2]

**Formula (USD):**  
CP = 329.99 ÷ 399.00 = 0.8

At a similar functional tier, **Zoom H6studio** also offers **6 isolated + stereo mix** (stereo mix up to 96 kHz) [4]. If more total tracks are needed without 32-bit float, **Zoom H8** provides up to **12 simultaneous tracks** [5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Framework (evidence-based, category-typical):**  
- **Warranty & service coverage:** Standard 1-year regional warranty with authorized repair centers under the TASCAM/TEAC network (region dependent).  
- **Firmware & documentation:** Regular firmware updates historically provided; English manuals available from the product docs portal.  
- **Parts & ecosystem:** Capsule system and accessories supported; USB operation across major OSes.  
- **Field failure data:** No large-sample third-party failure statistics publicly aggregated.  

Given documented support presence but limited independent durability metrics, reliability/support sits at **average** for the class.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Framework (goal ↔ means ↔ trade-offs):**  
- **Goal fit:** 32-bit float targets **clip-resilient** capture in unpredictable dynamics; six isolated inputs cover typical small ensemble/podcast/ENG needs.  
- **Operational efficiency:** Scene apps and touchscreen reduce setup time; **USB 8-in/2-out** expands use as a mobile interface.  
- **Trade-offs:** Six isolated inputs (plus stereo mix) cap expansion without external mixers; detachable mics trade convenience for capsule robustness.  
- **Alternatives:** For price-sensitive six-mic work, 32-bit peers exist (H6essential/H6studio). For higher track counts without 32-bit float, H8 is an option.

## Advice

Choose the Portacapture X8 if you need a **32-bit float handheld** with **six isolated mics**, detachable capsules, and an **8-in/2-out** interface. If price is a priority for six-mic workflows, evaluate **H6essential**; for a similar price tier with Zoom features, see **H6studio**. For more simultaneous tracks without 32-bit float, consider **H8**.
