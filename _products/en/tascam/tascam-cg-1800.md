## Overview

The TASCAM CG-1800 is a professional master clock generator designed for large-scale audio-video synchronization system construction. It employs high-precision OCXO (Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillator) achieving 0.01ppm frequency accuracy and ±0.005ppm/day stability. Equipped with 12 word clock outputs, 4 video outputs, and AES3/AES11 and S/PDIF digital outputs, it supports synchronization system construction in broadcast stations and large studios. TASCAM has established a solid position in the broadcast and recording industries as an established manufacturer handling professional audio equipment since the 1970s.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The CG-1800's clock accuracy of 0.01ppm demonstrates excellent performance in measurement terms. Its proprietary jitter management system using FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) circuits effectively removes external clock jitter and outputs stable clock signals. OCXO adoption makes it less susceptible to environmental temperature effects and ensures long-term stability. The glitch-free relock circuit prevents noise and skip sound generation during clock interruptions. It supports 10MHz external input, enabling further high-precision enhancement through connection with rubidium clocks or GPS clocks. However, regarding actual sound quality improvement effects, the audible threshold for clock jitter in digital audio systems is generally higher than commonly thought, raising questions about whether 0.01ppm level precision improvements can be recognized as actual audible differences, especially in home audio setups where synchronization demands are lower.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The high-precision clock generation technology using OCXO achieves performance exceeding industry standards. TASCAM's proprietary FPGA and PLL circuit design for jitter management systems is technically advanced and effective for improving external clock quality. 256×Fs output support ensures compatibility with various DAW systems including Pro Tools. Additional functions such as self-calibration, analyzer functions, and logging functions are comprehensive, improving convenience in system operation. However, as basic clock generation technology, it represents a combination of established technologies rather than revolutionary proprietary technology, positioning it as high-quality implementation of existing technologies rather than innovative unique technology. While not achieving industry-leading levels, it accomplishes sufficient technical levels for professional use.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The CG-1800 is priced at approximately 2,599 USD. While alternatives like the Antelope Audio OCX HD (1,895 USD) offer similar clock precision and jitter management, they lack the full complement of video outputs (4 in CG-1800 vs input-only in OCX HD), making direct equivalence limited. No significantly cheaper product with identical functions, including 12 word clock outputs and 4 video outputs, was identified. This positions the CG-1800 as reasonably priced for its specific feature set in professional synchronization applications, though alternatives may suffice for audio-only needs at lower cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

TASCAM has a long track record in broadcast stations and recording studios as a professional audio equipment manufacturer continuing since the 1970s. The product warranty period provides industry-standard levels with a global support system established. The CG-1800 features robust design intended for commercial use, capable of 24-hour continuous operation reliability. OCXO adoption enables expectation of long-term stable operation, with quality levels capable of withstanding use in mission-critical environments such as broadcast stations. Logging and analyzer functions enable monitoring and recording of system operation status, allowing efficient troubleshooting. However, firmware update frequency is lower compared to emerging manufacturers, with tendency for time-consuming addition of latest features.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design philosophy aimed at large-scale synchronization system construction is extremely rational. The configuration enabling synchronization of multiple audio-video devices with a single master clock through 12 word clock outputs and 4 video outputs is designed with high practicality for broadcast stations and large studios. Pursuing high precision and high stability through OCXO adoption represents a rational approach to synchronization precision requirements in professional applications. 10MHz external input support enables cooperation with higher-precision reference clocks, ensuring system expandability. Designs technically solving practical operational issues such as glitch-free circuits, self-calibration functions, and logging functions are highly commendable. Jitter management utilizing digital signal processing technology realizes high-precision synchronization difficult with conventional analog methods, based on rational design philosophy suitable for modern digital audio systems.

## Advice

The CG-1800 is suitable for deployment in environments requiring high-precision synchronization of numerous devices, such as broadcast stations and large recording studios. It will particularly demonstrate its true value in post-production environments requiring NTSC, PAL, and HD Tri-level video synchronization. However, this evaluation is for professional synchronization purposes; in home audio applications, no sound quality improvement is expected, and scientific validity would be 0.0 as jitter reductions below audible thresholds provide no benefit. As of 2025, this product has limited stock availability at some retailers, requiring consideration of procurement challenges. For small studios or personal use, alternatives like the Antelope OCX HD (1,895 USD) may offer sufficient performance for audio-only synchronization at a lower price, though lacking video outputs. Before purchase, clarify the actual required number of word clock outputs (CG-1800: 12 systems), video synchronization necessity, and 10MHz external reference clock cooperation plans to avoid over-specification. Compatibility verification with existing systems, particularly operational confirmation with DAW software, is essential. While recommendable for those prioritizing long-term stable operation and valuing TASCAM brand reliability, examining alternatives is prudent when emphasizing cost and availability.
