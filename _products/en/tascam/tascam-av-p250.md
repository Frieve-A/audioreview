## Overview

The TASCAM AV-P250 is a 1U, 15A rack power distributor intended for professional audio installations. It provides 13 outlets—10 switched on the rear and 3 unswitched on the front—plus a 15A resettable circuit breaker, polarity check terminal with neon indicator, and two onboard filters (surge-noise and line-noise) for basic AC hygiene [1]. It is a straightforward JP-market unit with AC 100V (50/60Hz) mains specification and a maximum connected load of 1490W [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

From a fidelity standpoint, this category rarely demonstrates audible improvements under controlled tests. The AV-P250’s functions are safety and convenience oriented: breaker protection, polarity verification, and surge/line-noise filtering [1]. There are no third-party measurements documenting reductions in system noise floor, THD+N, or crosstalk attributable to this unit. Manufacturer specs confirm AC 100V, 1490W maximum load and the presence of two filter blocks, but without quantified attenuation across frequency bands or audio analyzer data, audible benefits remain unverified [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The AV-P250 uses conventional components for this class: a thermal-magnetic 15A breaker, basic RFI/EMI (line-noise) and surge filtering, and a simple polarity checker [1]. It lacks advanced regulation, multi-stage sequenced switching (present on the AV-P250S sibling), or published high-order filtering architectures found in more sophisticated conditioners. Overall, it is a sound but standard design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Representative street price for AV-P250 is approximately **199 USD** (converted from a 29,100円 tax-in JP retail price on Aug 14, 2025 using ECB reference rates) [2][5].  
Cheapest equal-or-better alternative (normalized for outlet count) is:

- **Furman M-8x2** (15A, surge + RFI/EMI filtration; 9 outlets) **84.99 USD** [3] **+**  
- **GE 4-Outlet Power Strip** (UL/ETL listed) **8.95 USD** to match or exceed 13 outlets [4].

These together deliver equivalent user-facing functions (15A capacity, surge/RFI-EMI filtering) and meet or exceed the outlet-count requirement.  
**CP calculation:** 93.94 USD ÷ 199 USD = **0.47** → rounded **0.5**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

TASCAM/TEAC provides established distribution and after-sales support in Japan. The manual specifies a one-year warranty and includes a resettable 15A breaker for protection [1]. Given the brand’s professional market presence and straightforward assembly, medium-high confidence in reliability and parts availability is reasonable; no widespread failure data were found.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The product focuses on practical rack power management—clear outlet zoning (rear switched, front unswitched), polarity checking, and basic filtering—without extravagant claims. The design targets electrical safety and convenience rather than unsubstantiated “sound quality” enhancement, which is an appropriately rational stance for a power distributor [1].

## Advice

Use the AV-P250 when you need a neat 1U, 13-outlet AC distribution at 100V with basic protection and a polarity checker. If you do not specifically need 13 onboard outlets or JP-only mains spec, a **Furman M-8x2 plus a small 4-outlet strip** achieves equivalent functionality for markedly less money and broad availability in the US market [3][4]. For systems requiring sequenced power-up or advanced regulation, look to conditioners with published filter attenuation and timing control (e.g., sequencers or multi-stage EMI designs) and third-party measurement data.
