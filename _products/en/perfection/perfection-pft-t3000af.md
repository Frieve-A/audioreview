## Overview

The Perfection PFT-T3000AF is an 8-outlet power conditioner featuring an Active Noise Eliminator (ANE) circuit from Kanjitsu Denki. The ANE extracts high-frequency line noise and drives front-panel LEDs to visualize activity while claiming to reduce injected noise on the AC line. The PERFECTION brand was revived in 2023, and Kanjitsu reports the ANE circuit is covered by Japanese Patent No. 7570705 (registered 2024). Official direct-shop price is 132,000円 (about 900 USD).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As of August 17, 2025, we found no credible third-party bench data (attenuation curves in dB across kHz–MHz, analyzer-verified THD+N/SNR changes, or controlled ABX outcomes) showing audible improvements with PFT-T3000AF in an audio chain. Materials describe extracting “hundreds of kHz” noise and converting the energy to LED activity, but do not publish quantified suppression vs. frequency or downstream deltas. Absent such data, audible benefit remains unverified; safety features (surge and thermal protection) do not themselves guarantee audible fidelity gains.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The product integrates a proprietary ANE topology with conventional X/Y-capacitor filtering and provides real-time LED visualization of extracted noise. The patent (JP 7570705) supports originality of the noise-reduction circuit concept at the brand level. Engineering choices are coherent, but without published performance envelopes the measurable ceiling is unclear; we place it slightly above average for originality rather than proven execution.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

At 900 USD, cost-performance is weak when equivalent-or-better user-facing functions (8 outlets, EMI/RFI filtering, surge protection, diagnostic LEDs) are available far cheaper. We select Eaton Tripp Lite **ISOBAR8ULTRA** as the cheapest broadly available comparator meeting those functions per manufacturer documentation. Representative US market street price is about 100 USD.  
**CP calculation (USD basis):** 100 USD ÷ 900 USD = 0.11 → score 0.1.  
*Equivalence note:* ISOBAR8ULTRA provides 8 outlets, isolated filter banks for line-noise mitigation, diagnostic LEDs, and a 3840-J surge rating; on catalog-spec parity for user functions it is equal-or-better, pending any future third-party data for PFT-T3000AF.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Kanjitsu Denki is an established Japanese distributor/manufacturer (brand revived in 2023). PFT-T3000AF adds surge and thermal protection at the hardware level. Long-term field reliability data for this specific model is not yet available. By contrast, the comparator line includes lifetime warranty and connected-equipment coverage in the US market, but that does not directly alter this product’s reliability score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

This product is marketed as an **audio** accessory promising sound-quality gains, yet no evidence shows measurable, audible improvements. In that context it falls into non-scientific “occult audio” territory: visual LEDs and patent claims do not substitute for verified deltas at the equipment output. Given the lack of expected audible benefit as an audio device, we assign a low rationality score despite its practical surge protection.

## Advice

The PFT-T3000AF may appeal to users who value visual feedback of power-line activity and prefer a Japanese-made solution with a documented proprietary circuit. For evidence-driven readers, prioritize conditioners/configurations with published attenuation curves and downstream audio-path measurements—or rely on gear with robust internal PSUs that already reject line noise. From a functional standpoint, mainstream filtered strips like the ISOBAR8ULTRA deliver comparable features at roughly one-ninth the price; absent third-party proof of audible gains, the premium is difficult to justify.
