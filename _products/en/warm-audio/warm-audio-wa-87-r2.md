## Overview

The Warm Audio WA-87 R2 is a large-diaphragm FET condenser microphone designed to reproduce the classic Neumann U87 sound signature [1]. Featuring three selectable polar patterns (cardioid, omnidirectional, figure-8), the WA-87 R2 incorporates a vintage-correct K87-style capsule reproduction with gold-sputtered membrane, custom CineMag USA output transformer, NOS Fairchild transistor, and premium WIMA and Nichicon capacitors [2]. The R2 revision offers slightly improved output level and frequency response compared to the original WA-87, with a characteristic 7-10kHz boost designed to add clarity to vocal recordings [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The WA-87 R2 demonstrates mixed measured performance results across key microphone criteria. Frequency response of 20 Hz – 20 kHz [1] meets standard requirements, though the 7-10kHz boost [2] represents intentional deviation from flat response. Maximum SPL of 125 dB (132 dB with -10 dB pad) [1] falls between problematic and transparent performance levels, approaching the problematic threshold of 120 dB SPL and significantly below the excellent level of 140 dB SPL achieved by competing products like the Audio-Technica AT2050 (149 dB SPL) [3]. The noise specification of -117 dB [1] lacks proper dB-A weighting format required for standard measurement comparison - when properly specified, this would likely translate to approximately 17 dB-A equivalent noise level, falling within acceptable range but above the 10 dB-A transparent threshold. Without independent third-party measurements, conservative evaluation applies to manufacturer specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The WA-87 R2 employs vintage reproduction technology rather than cutting-edge innovation. While demonstrating in-house design capabilities and accumulated expertise in vintage gear reproduction [2], the microphone relies on outdated approaches including NOS Fairchild transistors and K87 capsule styling from the 1960s-70s era [2]. The custom CineMag USA transformer and discrete component selection represent quality implementation [2], but the technology offers no competitive advantage as vintage microphone reproduction has become commonplace. The analog-only approach lacks modern digital integration that could enhance functionality or performance.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The WA-87 R2 at 699 USD [1] faces significant cost-performance challenges when compared to equivalent alternatives. The Audio-Technica AT2050 at 160 USD [3] provides equivalent multi-pattern functionality (cardioid, omnidirectional, figure-8), comparable frequency response (20-20,000 Hz), and superior maximum SPL performance (149 dB SPL, 159 dB with pad) [3] compared to the WA-87 R2's 125-132 dB capability [1]. CP = 160 USD ÷ 699 USD = 0.2. The AT2050 is equipped with equivalent polar pattern functionality and superior measured maximum SPL performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Warm Audio provides excellent support infrastructure with a 5-year warranty [4] that significantly exceeds the industry standard 2-year coverage. The company implements 100% hands-on inspection and comprehensive testing of each unit before shipping in Austin, Texas [4]. The simple large-diaphragm condenser construction with minimal moving parts provides inherently robust design resistant to failure. Global support availability through authorized dealers and direct manufacturer support, plus repair services available for modest fees [4], contribute to strong reliability credentials.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Warm Audio's design philosophy emphasizes vintage reproduction and nostalgia rather than measurement-focused improvement [5]. The approach prioritizes expensive vintage-style components (NOS Fairchild transistors, K87 capsule reproduction) [2] without demonstrated measurement advantages over modern alternatives. Marketing appeals to subjective characteristics and vintage "character" without scientific verification of audible benefits [5]. The conservative vintage reproduction approach avoids modern solutions that could potentially improve measured performance or reduce costs. While the company achieves legitimate professional microphone functionality, the vintage-focused philosophy lacks scientific rationality in pursuing optimal measured performance per dollar invested.

## Advice

The WA-87 R2 serves professionals seeking vintage aesthetic and brand recognition rather than optimal measured performance value. Consider the Audio-Technica AT2050 [3] for equivalent functionality at significantly lower cost with superior maximum SPL capability. The WA-87 R2 may appeal to users specifically requiring vintage U87 emulation for stylistic reasons, though measured performance improvements over cheaper alternatives remain unsubstantiated. The excellent 5-year warranty [4] provides confidence for professional use scenarios where vintage styling justifies the price premium.
