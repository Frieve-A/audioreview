## Overview

The Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC is a true wireless earphone priced at 12,990 yen that first incorporates Ultra Noise Cancelling 3.0, achieving Anker's strongest noise cancellation performance. Adopting 11mm large-diameter drivers and high-sensitivity sensors, it instantly measures ear shape to eliminate noise previously overlooked. LDAC support enables high-resolution audio quality with up to 50 hours of long-duration playback. Supporting IPX4 water resistance, multipoint connection, and wireless charging, available in five colors: black, white, navy, pink, and light blue, achieving both practicality and high functionality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Soundcore Liberty 4 NC demonstrates noise suppression effects surpassing previous models through Ultra Noise Cancelling 3.0, combining 11mm large-diameter drivers with high-sensitivity sensors. Technology that instantly measures ear shape and performs personal optimization can be evaluated as a scientific approach. LDAC support enables high-quality transmission up to 990kbps, capable of transmitting three times the information volume compared to conventional SBC/AAC. However, specific objective measurement data such as THD values and SNR values are not publicly disclosed, and quantified dB values for noise cancellation performance are not specified. While Soundcore app equalizer and HearID functions for sound quality adjustment are implemented, transparency in scientific verification has room for improvement.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Soundcore Liberty 4 NC's technical standards maintain industry-standard levels through combination of 11mm drivers and multi-microphone hybrid ANC system. Ultra Noise Cancelling 3.0 introduces ear shape recognition technology, achieving optimization corresponding to individual differences. LDAC support enables high-quality transmission, and functional integration such as multipoint connection and wireless charging are appropriately implemented. Proprietary technologies like BassUp technology and HearID function provide added value but cannot be considered fundamental acoustic technology innovations. Overall, high completion in this price range is achieved through effective combination and optimization of existing technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Soundcore Liberty 4 NC achieves excellent cost performance at 12,990 yen (currently 9,990 yen) compared to equivalent-function competitive products. Compared to same-price-range EarFun Air Pro 4 (9,990 yen) and Xiaomi Redmi Buds 6 Pro (9,980 yen), it has competitiveness with CP = 9,980 yen รท 9,990 yen = 0.999. As a product simultaneously incorporating three major functions: LDAC support, maximum 50-hour playback, and Ultra Noise Cancelling 3.0, it demonstrates price advantage with CP = 9,990 yen รท 15,000 yen = 0.67 against Sony WF-C710N (approximately 15,000 yen). Providing AirPods Pro first-generation level noise cancellation performance in the early 10,000 yen range, it achieves highest-level cost performance within the product category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Anker's standard 18-month warranty (extendable to 24 months with member registration) applies, with rapid replacement and repair response for product defects. IPX4 water resistance ensures durability for daily use, with domestic support systems also established. Integrated button design enabling one-button charging case opening, Bluetooth pairing, and connection reset emphasizes practicality. Soundcore app firmware update support and function customization are comprehensive. However, specific data on battery degradation rates and failure statistics during long-term use are not publicly disclosed. Provides above-average standards in both reliability and support systems compared to same-price-range products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Soundcore Liberty 4 NC's design philosophy follows "achieving high functionality at affordable prices" approach, aiming to balance noise cancellation performance improvement with long-duration playback. Technology that instantly measures ear shape and optimizes noise cancellation is rational, deserving evaluation as individual difference accommodation. While LDAC support enables high-resolution audio quality, bass-heavy tuning through BassUp technology is unsuitable for applications requiring flat acoustic characteristics. Practicality-focused design including five-color expansion and multipoint connection is rational, but existence significance as dedicated audio equipment is limited to combination of long-duration playback and noise cancellation performance.

## Advice

Soundcore Liberty 4 NC is the optimal choice for users prioritizing noise cancellation performance in the early 10,000 yen range. Anker's strongest noise cancellation performance provides significant benefits for commuting and focused work environments, achieving AirPods Pro first-generation level sound isolation at approximately half the price. Also recommended for Android users wanting to enjoy high-resolution audio quality through LDAC support. 50-hour long-duration playback is attractive for users wanting to reduce charging frequency. However, sound quality tends toward bass-heavy characteristics, making it unsuitable for delicate music playback such as classical and jazz. In comparison with same-price-range EarFun Air Pro 4, Liberty 4 NC suits noise cancellation performance priority, while Air Pro 4 suits sound quality balance priority. Strongly recommended for users seeking noise cancellation performance with cost performance priority.
