## Overview

The Anker Soundcore Space One is an entry-level active noise canceling (ANC) wireless headphone released in 2024. Currently priced at approximately 10,990 JPY (with market prices ranging from 8,490-10,990 JPY), it offers LDAC support, 55-hour battery life, and Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. It features 40mm dynamic drivers and implements active noise canceling functionality through Ultra Noise Canceling 2.0 technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The frequency response exhibits a V-shaped profile that significantly deviates from transparent acoustic reproduction. According to RTINGS measurements, it shows boosted bass and treble with attenuated midrange characteristics, resulting in veiled and thin vocals and instruments. This frequency response falls into the problematic values category, substantially compromising fidelity to the original audio. While ANC performance demonstrates effectiveness in blocking ambient noise (superior to competitors like Sony WH-CH720N), the overall audio reproduction quality is limited by the frequency response characteristics. LDAC support enables high-resolution audio codec transmission, but the effectiveness is constrained by the driver's inherent frequency response deviations from neutrality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product incorporates current industry-standard technical elements including 40mm dynamic drivers, Bluetooth 5.3, and LDAC support. However, based on measurement results, the acoustic design of the drivers and ANC algorithm optimization do not reach industry average standards. Particularly when compared to competing products in the same price range, no advantages are observed in acoustic measurement values, and technical innovation or uniqueness is limited. The design philosophy remains within existing technology combinations, with low levels of proprietary technical value addition.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

As a comparison reference, we selected the Sony WH-CH720N (current market price: 13,446 JPY) which offers equivalent ANC functionality, though with different performance characteristics. While the Sony provides superior sound quality with more balanced frequency response, the Space One offers stronger noise cancellation performance. Both support LDAC and provide similar battery performance. CP calculation: 13,446 JPY รท 10,990 JPY = 1.22, but clamped to 1.0. Among products offering ANC functionality with LDAC support, this product achieves competitive pricing levels, though not necessarily the absolute minimum when considering current market prices and performance variations.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product provides the standard 18-month warranty typical of the Anker brand, with customer support available in Japan. However, the company's technical accumulation in the headphone market is shallow compared to specialized audio manufacturers, and the track record for long-term product improvements and firmware updates is limited. While there is a proven track record in battery-related technology, the expertise and reliability as audio equipment remains at industry average levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The direction of providing ANC functionality at a low price aligns with market needs, but the design lacks sufficient scientific basis for audio quality aspects. The V-shaped frequency characteristic is presumably aimed at "exciting sound" for general consumers, but this deviates from the essential value of audio equipment: fidelity to original sound. Moreover, with competing products that achieve equivalent functionality with better measurement results, the lack of clear technical differentiation elements keeps the rationality of design philosophy at a low level.

## Advice

For those seeking noise-canceling headphones in the 10,000 JPY range, this product offers one of the strongest noise cancellation capabilities in its price category, but it cannot be recommended for users prioritizing audio quality. The Space One excels in blocking ambient noise compared to competitors like the Sony WH-CH720N, making it suitable for environments where noise isolation is the primary concern. However, for higher audio quality and more balanced sound reproduction, the Sony WH-CH720N represents a better choice despite requiring an additional investment of approximately 2,500-3,000 JPY. Users should consider whether superior noise cancellation or better sound quality aligns with their primary use case when making a purchasing decision.
