## Overview

The Anker Soundcore Space One Pro (model A3062) is an over-ear Bluetooth headphone released in September 2024, originally priced at 199.99 USD but currently available at market pricing around 114 USD. It features adaptive active noise cancellation driven by 6 microphones, 40mm dynamic drivers with PEEK and polyurethane construction, and contemporary wireless connectivity including LDAC codec support. The headphones offer up to 60 hours of battery life without ANC and 40 hours with ANC enabled, along with fast charging capabilities and foldable design for portability.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The Space One Pro demonstrates poor scientific validity based on available measurements and specifications. Critical deficiencies include manufacturer-specified THD of less than 3%, which significantly exceeds the problematic threshold of 0.5% for headphones. Third-party measurements from SoundGuys reveal substantial frequency response deviations with "significant over-emphasis in sub-bass, unusual dips and bumps from mid to treble frequencies, and an intense treble spike at 6kHz" [1]. The Multi-Dimensional Audio Quality Score (MDAQS) of 2.4 indicates poor overall measured performance [1]. Essential measurements including S/N ratio, dynamic range, and crosstalk data are unavailable. The combination of poor THD specifications and confirmed problematic frequency response measurements places this product well into the problematic performance category.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The technology implementation incorporates appropriate contemporary standards including LDAC codec support and Bluetooth 5.3, representing competent but unremarkable technical advancement. The product features 40mm dynamic drivers with PEEK and polyurethane materials, adaptive ANC driven by 6 microphones, and multipoint connectivity support. While the technological approach is current and functional, it lacks proprietary innovations or technical differentiation beyond standard industry implementations. The inclusion of modern codecs and recent Bluetooth standards demonstrates adequate technology adoption without significant breakthrough innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. At current market pricing of 114 USD, the Space One Pro faces competition from cheaper alternatives offering equivalent or superior functionality. The EarFun Wave Pro at 79.99 USD provides equivalent ANC, LDAC support, Bluetooth 5.3, multipoint connectivity, 40mm drivers, and app control, while delivering superior battery life (80h without ANC, 55h with ANC versus 60h/40h) [2]. The Wave Pro is equipped with equivalent functions, and battery life and ANC performance are equivalent-or-better. CP = 79.99 USD ÷ 114.00 USD = 0.7.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product benefits from Anker/Soundcore's established global support infrastructure and generally reliable construction quality. The 18-month warranty period falls below the industry standard of 2 years. Support features include manufacturer assistance through the soundcore app with warranty service integration, global support system coverage, and Anker's established reliability track record in consumer electronics. The simple headphone structure with robust build design contributes positively to inherent reliability, though the shorter warranty period represents a limitation compared to competitors offering longer coverage periods.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy reflects standard contemporary consumer audio engineering approaches with rational but unremarkable implementation. The inclusion of LDAC codec support demonstrates measurement-focused audio quality priorities, while app-based EQ and optimization features contribute to measurable performance improvements. The approach avoids occult or unscientific claims, focusing on practical functionality and contemporary connectivity standards. However, the design lacks significant innovation beyond baseline consumer expectations and represents conventional rather than forward-thinking engineering philosophy in the competitive headphone market.

## Advice

For potential purchasers seeking over-ear ANC headphones, the Space One Pro at current market pricing of 114 USD presents improved value but still faces limitations due to poor measured audio performance. While cost-performance has improved significantly from the original MSRP, the EarFun Wave Pro continues to offer equivalent functionality with superior battery performance at 79.99 USD. Those prioritizing scientific audio quality should consider headphones with verified transparent-level frequency response measurements and lower THD specifications. The Space One Pro's poor frequency response with substantial deviations and high THD specifications make it unsuitable for critical listening applications, though it may be acceptable for casual listening given the more reasonable current pricing.
