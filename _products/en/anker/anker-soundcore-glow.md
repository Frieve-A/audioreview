## Overview

The Soundcore Glow is a 360-degree acoustic design portable Bluetooth speaker released by Anker's sub-brand Soundcore in November 2023. It features 30W output with synchronized light effects, IP67 waterproof performance, and 18-hour battery life. The design incorporates a downward-facing 2.5-inch full-range driver with two passive radiators on top, aimed at achieving omnidirectional acoustic dispersion.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Independent measurements reveal serious frequency response problems [1]. Excessive boost occurs above 10kHz, with significant dips (approximately 3-5dB) in the upper midrange between 1-5kHz. This represents attenuation in the frequency band where human hearing sensitivity is highest, causing clear negative impact on sound quality. As volume increases, bass and treble relatively attenuate, with 200Hz-800Hz becoming the primary reproduction band at 100% volume. Phase issues from the 360-degree design also contribute to sound quality degradation, with measurement results falling into problematic levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 360-degree acoustic design and synchronized LED lighting system show uniqueness, but many technical challenges are evident in sound quality aspects. The single 2.5-inch full-range driver configuration is inferior to 2-way systems in frequency separation precision. Bluetooth 5.3 with SBC codec-only support represents current standard levels. While features like BassUp technology and Partycast 2.0 are included, they don't resolve fundamental acoustic design problems. IP67 waterproof performance matches competitor technology levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At the current price of 60 USD, comparison with equivalent-function portable Bluetooth speakers shows the JBL Flip 6 selling at 100 USD [2]. The JBL Flip 6 has a 2-way speaker system and superior frequency response, but being higher priced, the cost-performance calculation yields 100 USD รท 60 USD = 1.67, with the upper limit of 1.0 applied. The Soundcore Glow is the cheapest among equivalent-function products, earning a cost-performance rating of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Standard 18-month warranty is provided under the Anker brand with global support structure. Firmware updates are supported through the Soundcore app, enabling 9-band EQ adjustment. IP67 waterproof performance ensures physical durability, but as a newer brand line, long-term reliability data is limited. Compared to competitive products in the same price range, this represents industry-average warranty and support systems.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The 360-degree acoustic design is an irrational approach that cannot physically avoid phase interference. The frequency response problems confirmed in measurement data demonstrate the limitations of this design philosophy. LED lighting functions don't contribute to audio performance and actually increase battery consumption, reducing practicality. This design prioritizes marketing differentiation over sound quality improvement. There's insufficient rational approach toward achieving scientifically transparent levels, and adopting proven conventional 2-way speaker design would yield superior sound quality results.

## Advice

Not recommended for purchasers prioritizing sound quality. Frequency response issues result in unnatural tonality, especially with vocal-containing music. For uses prioritizing party atmosphere and outdoor ambiance creation, where LED lighting effects and long battery life are valued, this could be an option. For superior sound quality in the same price range, we strongly recommend choosing proven 2-way design products like the JBL Flip 6 or Sony SRS-XB100. Expectations for 360-degree acoustics should be realistically evaluated based on measurement data.
