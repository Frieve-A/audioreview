## Overview

The Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 is a wireless earphone with official launch announcement on May 7, 2025, with an MSRP of 129.99 USD. It features Adaptive Noise Cancelling 3.0, Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity, LDAC support, and claims up to 12 hours of continuous playback. As an Anker brand product targeting the mid-range wireless earphone market, its technical advantages and price competitiveness require verification.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Based on measurement data evaluation, the Liberty 5's frequency response shows bass emphasis below 150Hz and treble emphasis in the 4-8kHz range, with a notable dip around 200Hz. This characteristic deviates from fidelity to the master source, causing vocals and piano fundamentals to be reproduced quieter than intended. THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) shows estimated values below 0.1%, but the S/N ratio of approximately 85dB falls short of the excellent standard for headphones/earphones (100dB or higher). ANC performance provides about 25dB attenuation, which is standard but limited compared to industry-leading 40dB or higher. While LDAC support enables high-quality codec transmission, the fundamental reproduction characteristic issues limit scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of Bluetooth 5.4 and LDAC support for latest wireless transmission technology is commendable. Adaptive Noise Cancelling 3.0 performs environmental adaptation at 0.3-second intervals, and the 6-microphone AI system represents a technically sound approach. The wool paper diaphragm and bass-enhanced acoustic tube adoption also show design ingenuity. However, despite these technological investments, frequency response issues remain unresolved, indicating that technical potential is not sufficiently utilized for sound quality improvement. While above industry average in technical level, it doesn't reach the highest standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against the Liberty 5's 129.99 USD, the QCY MeloBuds Pro (39.99 USD) exists with equivalent or superior functionality. The QCY MeloBuds Pro provides ANC functionality (46dB attenuation), IPX4 water resistance, 8.5-hour playback, dual device connection, LDAC support, and other basic features equivalent to or exceeding the Liberty 5. Cost-performance calculation: 39.99 USD รท 129.99 USD = 0.31, meaning the Liberty 5 provides equivalent functionality at approximately 3.3 times the price. Anker's own Soundcore Space A40 (80 USD) also offers similar functionality, indicating that the Liberty 5's pricing deviates from market standards.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As an Anker brand product, it possesses an established support system and quality management system, providing above-average industry reliability. The Soundcore app is intuitive and responsive, supporting firmware updates. IP55 water resistance ensures durability, and battery life achieves approximately 7-8 hours in actual testing, close to specifications. Long-term failure rates and support response can be expected to exceed industry average based on Anker's track record.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Technical directions contributing to measurable sound quality improvements, such as LDAC support and adaptive ANC, are rational. App-based equalizer functionality and HearID hearing correction features can also be evaluated as scientifically grounded approaches. However, focusing on additional features without resolving fundamental frequency response issues raises questions about rationality. The necessity of existing as a dedicated audio device is also diminished by the presence of more affordable equivalent-function products. While the direction is generally rational, there is room for improvement in priority setting.

## Advice

While the Liberty 5 is technically a wireless earphone with modern features, the 129.99 USD price point presents the greatest issue. Equivalent functionality is available through the QCY MeloBuds Pro (39.99 USD) or Anker's own Space A40 (80 USD), making rational reasons for choosing the Liberty 5 limited. Particularly, the QCY MeloBuds Pro provides excellent 46dB ANC performance and LDAC support in the same price range, achieving higher technical value. Sound quality also suffers from frequency response issues, making performance improvements commensurate with the price unlikely. For those considering purchase, we strongly recommend first examining the QCY MeloBuds Pro or Anker's own Space A40. Even when prioritizing Anker brand reliability, the Space A40 provides sufficient performance and reliability.
