## Overview

Released in 2023 under Anker's Soundcore brand, this compact Bluetooth speaker offers 8W output, 360-degree sound, music-synchronized LED lighting, IP67 dust/water resistance, up to 12 hours of playback, and PartyCast 2.0 (up to 100 units). It supports Bluetooth 5.3 and SBC codec.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Official detailed measurements such as frequency response and THD are not published, and no rigorous third-party datasets were found (per policy, unknown measurement performance starts at 0.5). Given the 360-degree dispersion and small driver, a flat 20Hzâ€“20kHz response is unlikely. No evidence supports achieving transparent-level performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This is a combination of established techniques: compact enclosure with passive radiator bass assist, 360-degree acoustics, and DSP tuning. Bluetooth 5.3 and IP67 are practical but not innovative. LED lighting is an auxiliary feature and does not directly improve sound quality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Following the policy (cross-class/method allowed; must be equal-or-better in features and measurement), we surveyed 2025-08 market offerings for products that match IP67 dust/water resistance, music-synced LED, 360-degree sound, Bluetooth 5.3, and PartyCast-class multi-speaker linking without any inferiority. We could not confirm any cheaper product meeting all of these simultaneously. Therefore, the globally cheapest equal-or-better option equals this unit, yielding a CP of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Anker's 18-month warranty and firmware/EQ updates via the app are practical. Long-term field reliability and MTBF data remain limited, so we rate it average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design is coherent for outdoor and ambience use. Prioritizing compactness, waterproofing, and lighting is reasonable, but it limits pursuit of transparent-level acoustics.

## Advice

Best for users prioritizing ambience (LED) and durability (IP67) in a very compact form. If primarily seeking audio fidelity, consider models focusing on acoustic design even without lighting.
