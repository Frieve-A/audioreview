## Overview

The Anker SoundCore 3 is a portable Bluetooth speaker released in 2020. As the successor to the popular SoundCore 2 model, it increased output from 12W to 16W and adopted titanium diaphragm drivers and BassUp technology. At a price point of 65 USD, it achieves IPX7 waterproof performance and 24-hour long playback, with PartyCast functionality enabling connection of over 100 units. Through the reliability of the Anker brand and affordable pricing, it has gained certain support in the portable speaker market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The SoundCore 3's measured performance is standard for a small portable speaker, but scientifically meaningful improvements are limited. According to RTINGS measurement data, the frequency response shows variations of approximately ±5dB across 20Hz-20kHz, with significant output attenuation confirmed in deep bass regions (below 50Hz). The high-frequency range gradually decreases above 8kHz, giving an overall impression of "muffled and veiled sound." At maximum volume of 83dB, approximately 1% THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) was measured, indicating the physical constraints of small speakers. While the titanium diaphragm adoption claims a reproduction range up to 40kHz, frequencies above 20kHz are beyond the human audible range and hold no practical significance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design combining dual titanium diaphragm drivers with two passive radiators represents an appropriate technical choice for this price range. The adoption of Bluetooth 5.0 and PartyCast functionality for multi-unit connection technology is commendable at the implementation level. BassUp technology's real-time bass enhancement, combined with DSP limiters, is a rational approach to compensate for the physical constraints of a small enclosure. However, it fundamentally represents a combination of existing technologies, with limited originality or technical innovation. The adoption of USB-C charging represents a design decision adapted to the times.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Against the SoundCore 3's 65 USD price, the cheapest competing product with equivalent or superior functionality is the Tribit XSound Go at 34 USD. Calculation formula: 34 USD ÷ 65 USD = 0.52. The Tribit XSound Go features the same 16W output, 24-hour playback, and IPX7 waterproof performance, while providing more stable connectivity through Bluetooth 5.3. With its dual 8W driver configuration and 4400mAh battery, it achieves nearly equivalent sound quality and convenience to the SoundCore 3 at approximately half the price. This comparison clearly shows that the SoundCore 3's cost-performance falls below market standards.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While Anker generally provides good warranty systems, reliability data specific to the SoundCore 3 is limited. Although water resistance is ensured through IPX7 waterproof performance, specific data regarding battery degradation and driver performance maintenance during long-term use is insufficient. The 5200mAh battery's 24-hour playback is attractive, but public information about charge-discharge cycle counts and battery lifespan is scarce, making long-term reliability assessment difficult. The support system remains within the scope of standard product warranties.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The SoundCore 3's design philosophy contains a mixture of rational and irrational elements. Specialization for use as a small portable speaker is rational, with IPX7 waterproofing and long playback representing appropriate decisions emphasizing practicality. However, claims of reproduction range up to 40kHz far exceed the audible range and have strong marketing elements lacking scientific basis. DSP processing through BassUp technology is rational as compensation for physical constraints, but fundamental acoustic design limitations remain unresolved. Its existence significance as dedicated audio equipment is limited to differentiation from smartphone built-in speakers, remaining insufficient for advanced sound quality pursuit.

## Advice

The SoundCore 3 is difficult to recommend in the current portable speaker market from a cost-performance perspective. The Tribit XSound Go, which features the same 16W output, 24-hour playback, and IPX7 waterproof performance, is available at approximately half the price at 34 USD, with superior connection stability through newer Bluetooth 5.3. Reasons to choose the SoundCore 3 are limited to trust in the Anker brand or multi-unit connection through PartyCast functionality. For budget-conscious buyers, the Tribit XSound Go is recommended, while those prioritizing brand support should consider the SoundCore 2 or higher-tier SoundCore Motion series. Detailed specification comparison with competing products and actual sound quality verification are essential before purchase.
