## Overview

The Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 is a core model in Anker's lineup of true wireless earbuds. It features dual dynamic drivers (9.2mm and 6mm), Bluetooth 5.3, LDAC support, and active noise cancellation functionality. Positioned as a cost-performance focused product leveraging the company's technical capabilities, it is designed as a feature-rich earbud for general consumers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

According to RTINGS measurement data, the frequency response shows a "very bright sound profile" with enhanced bass but even more emphasized treble, failing to reach transparency levels (±0.5dB). While equipped with Ultra Noise Cancelling 2.0 functionality, specific dB performance data is not publicly available, making it unclear whether it achieves the industry's highest standard of 40dB or more. RTINGS evaluates the THD performance as "good weighted harmonic distortion performance," but specific THD values are unpublished. LDAC codec support enables high-resolution audio playback, but auditory improvement effects are limited due to the acoustic characteristics shown in measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The dual dynamic driver configuration is a common design approach with limited uniqueness. Bluetooth 5.3 and LDAC support represent current standard specifications without notable technological innovation. The ANC algorithm also falls within the scope of generic digital signal processing technology. While the housing design and acoustic tuning are adequate for mass-produced products, no industry-leading technological advantages are confirmed. Overall, it positions at industry average technical levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Against the verified current market price of 68 USD (Amazon Japan, July 2025), a competing product with equivalent or superior functions and performance exists: the EarFun Air Pro 4 (verified at 67 USD on Amazon Japan). The EarFun Air Pro 4 features 10mm drivers, 50dB adaptive ANC performance, aptX Lossless support, 52-hour playback, and many specifications that match or exceed the Liberty 4. While the calculation is `67 USD ÷ 68 USD = 0.975...`, based on the review policy's rule of rounding to the second decimal place, the rating is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Anker has a proven track record as a charger manufacturer with good basic quality control. The 18-month warranty and customer support system provide industry-standard levels of service. Firmware update support is available, enabling functional improvements for long-term use. However, compared to audio specialist manufacturers, the depth of support in acoustic technology aspects is limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy adopts a realistic approach combining generic chips and drivers, which is fundamentally rational. The inclusion of LDAC and ANC functions demonstrates commitment to sound quality improvement. However, with higher-performance competing products existing in the same price range, differentiation elements are insufficient.

## Advice

The Soundcore Liberty 4 is a stable quality wireless earbud with cost-performance nearly equivalent to the EarFun Air Pro 4 in the same price range. Since both provide similar functions around 67 USD, the choice can be made based on brand preference or minor functional differences. Liberty 4 is suitable for those who value trust in the Anker brand or integration with existing Anker products, while EarFun Air Pro 4 becomes an option for those prioritizing the latest aptX Lossless or extended battery life. Both have sufficient basic performance, but for those seeking higher sound quality, we recommend considering higher-end models with an additional budget.
