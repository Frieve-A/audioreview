## Overview

The Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro is a true wireless earbuds model released in October 2024. It features seven sensors (six sound sensors and one atmospheric pressure sensor) to achieve up to 30dB of active noise canceling performance. Equipped with ACCA 3.0 technology combining 10.5mm drivers and titanium-coated tweeters, LDAC support for high-resolution audio playback, and IPX5 water resistance, it is priced at 129.99 USD (approximately 19,300 JPY). It is positioned as a premium model in Anker's audio product lineup.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The frequency response generally adheres to the headphone preference curve across the 20Hz-20kHz range, but measurements show approximately +3dB emphasis in the low frequencies below 200Hz. ANC performance achieves approximately 30dB attenuation in the low frequencies, which can be evaluated as a clear audible effect. However, detailed measurement data for distortion (THD) is not publicly available, and achievement of transparent levels (0.05% or below) cannot be confirmed. LDAC codec support theoretically enables high-resolution audio playback up to 96kHz/24bit, but actual sound quality improvement effects are limited. S/N ratio and frequency response measurements meet industry standard levels, and audibly meaningful improvements are recognized.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The composite driver configuration (10.5mm woofer + titanium-coated tweeter) using ACCA 3.0 technology is an acoustically rational design. The 360-degree noise capture system using seven sensors shows technological advancement compared to conventional 2-4 sensor configurations. The adaptive ANC algorithm using atmospheric pressure sensors is advanced technology implemented only in limited products in the industry. Bluetooth 5.3 support and multipoint connection functionality also meet current technical standards. However, driver technology and DAC circuits are mainly combinations of existing technologies, and innovative proprietary technology cannot be confirmed. It is evaluated as a technology level slightly above industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Priced at 129.99 USD, this product demonstrates exceptional and unique cost-performance. There are currently no competing products on the market that offer a comparable or superior level of all key features—including LDAC support, a dual-driver configuration (ACAA 3.0), high-performance adaptive ANC, and IPX5 water resistance—at a lower price. Many alternatives compromise on the driver configuration (using a single driver) or have a lower water resistance rating (IPX4). Therefore, as the sole option offering this combination of features at this price point, its cost-performance is rated 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Anker maintains a highly rated customer support system in the industry and provides an 18-month product warranty. This exceeds the industry standard of 12 months. Firmware updates are regularly provided through the dedicated app, with continuous feature additions and bug fixes. IPX5 water resistance ensures reliability for daily use. Specific data on failure rates is not publicly available, but market evaluation of the company's true wireless earbuds product line is favorable. Repair and replacement systems through global deployment are also established, and it is evaluated as reliability and support standards above industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Feature implementation such as adaptive ANC using multiple sensors, high-resolution audio support through LDAC compatibility, and multipoint connection suited to modern usage environments is rational. However, the significance of existence as dedicated audio equipment is limited, and clear advantages compared to smartphone + high-performance external DAC/amp combinations are not recognized. The design policy emphasizes measurable performance improvements, and non-scientific sound quality improvement claims are not observed. Improvements in battery efficiency (5-minute charging for 4-hour playback) and adoption of fast charging technology show a development approach that emphasizes practicality. Within the true wireless earbuds category, it is based on rational design philosophy and shows overall good rationality.

## Advice

This product boasts outstanding cost-performance for its feature set, making it a compelling option for many users. If you are looking for high-quality sound via LDAC, expressive audio from dual drivers, and practical ANC and IPX5 water resistance for under 130 USD, there are virtually no direct competitors. While higher-end models like the Sony WF-1000XM5 offer superior sound quality and ANC, their price is significantly higher. This product is one of the most highly recommended for users who want to get advanced features at a reasonable price.
