## Overview

The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro is a true wireless earbuds model released in 2020. It features PureNote driver technology, LDAC support, HearID personalized EQ, and active noise cancellation functionality at approximately USD 130 USD price point. As an entry from the Anker brand into the true wireless earbuds market, this product aimed to provide competitive features at an accessible price. However, with successor models now available, it has become a technologically outdated generation product.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

According to measurement data, the frequency response exhibits extreme bass emphasis, reproducing frequencies below 100Hz at approximately 3 times the volume of midrange frequencies. Total harmonic distortion shows small peaks in some high-frequency regions but remains within acceptable ranges overall. However, the midrange and most high-frequency regions are excessively suppressed, significantly compromising vocal and instrument transparency. The ANC function achieves approximately 50% noise reduction in the 100-1000Hz band, but this is clearly inferior compared to current state-of-the-art ANC technology that realizes over 75% noise reduction. While LDAC support is technically meaningful, the fundamental acoustic characteristics have significant issues that prevent full utilization of high-resolution audio benefits.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

PureNote driver technology provides 45% improvement in bass response and 30% wider frequency bandwidth compared to conventional drivers. The 10-layer nano-hardened coating driver reinforcement shows design innovation. LDAC support enables 3 times the data transmission of standard Bluetooth codecs. However, these technologies represent 2020 standards and are now industry-standard level as of 2025. The HearID personalized EQ is an interesting feature but does not solve fundamental acoustic characteristic issues. Six-microphone call quality enhancement and IPX4 water resistance are practical but lack notable technical innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro has a market price of approximately USD 130 USD (about 127 USD). A competing product with equivalent or superior functionality is the EarFun Air Pro 4 (USD 99 USD, approximately 97 USD). The EarFun Air Pro 4 provides ANC functionality with 75% noise reduction, IPX5 water resistance, wireless charging support, and 11 hours of continuous playback, achieving equivalent or superior user-oriented performance. Cost performance = 97 USD รท 127 USD = 0.76, resulting in a 0.8 evaluation. The Nothing Ear 2 (USD 149 USD, approximately 147 USD) also offers 40dB ANC performance with IP54 water resistance and wireless charging in a similar price range, indicating numerous competitive products exist.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Anker brand generally maintains high reliability with an 18-month warranty. Firmware update support through the Soundcore app is continuously provided, with product support systems at industry-standard levels. IPX4 water resistance ensures protection against sweat and water splashes. However, the approximately 3.5-hour continuous playback time is insufficient for long-distance travel, limiting practical usability. Specific data regarding battery longevity and long-term quality maintenance is limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The HearID personalized EQ system for individual hearing profile optimization represents a scientifically grounded rational approach. The three ANC modes (Transport, Outdoor, Indoor) for environmental adaptation functionality are practical. However, the fundamental acoustic characteristics showing excessive midrange and high-frequency suppression causing audio quality degradation is irrational. Particularly, the setting to reproduce frequencies below 100Hz at 3 times volume significantly compromises original sound fidelity. The nine ear tip sizes (XXXS to XL) for fit optimization is rational, but the 3.5-hour battery life limits practical usability. As of 2025, numerous competing products exist that can achieve equivalent functionality with higher performance and lower cost, reducing the necessity for this dedicated product's existence.

## Advice

The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro was an innovative product with advanced features in 2020, but as of 2025, it has become a technologically outdated generation. If considering purchase, we recommend first evaluating current market conditions. Options exist such as the EarFun Air Pro 4, which provides superior ANC performance in the same price range, or the Nothing Ear 2, which offers higher overall performance at similar pricing.

For those prioritizing audio quality, please understand the audio quality degradation caused by extreme bass emphasis and midrange/high-frequency suppression before making your decision. If ANC functionality is the top priority, this product's approximately 50% effectiveness is clearly inferior compared to latest products achieving 75% noise reduction. The short battery life (3.5 hours) is also inadequate for extended usage.

For current purchases, we recommend considering successor models like the Liberty 4 NC or Liberty 4 Pro. These new models offer significant technological improvements and represent more rational choices within the same brand. For budget-conscious users, the EarFun Air Pro 4, providing equivalent or superior functionality at approximately three-quarters the price, would be the optimal choice.
