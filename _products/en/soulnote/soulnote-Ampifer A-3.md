## Overview

The soulnote A-3 is a flagship integrated amplifier crafted by the Japanese high-end audio manufacturer soulnote. It was developed with the concept of integrating the company's P-3 preamplifier and two M-3 monoblock power amplifiers into a single chassis. Positioned as the technical culmination of soulnote, which was established in 2004 by former Marantz engineers, it adopts unique technical approaches including SEPP circuits using TO3 metal-can bipolar transistors, dual 700VA power transformers, and a completely left-right separated design. The robust 31kg chassis and three-point support spike structure demonstrate consideration for vibration control measures.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

According to measurement data, the specifications include a frequency response of 2Hz-200kHz (±3dB/1W/8Ω), THD of 0.27% (1W/8Ω), and an S/N ratio of 110dB. These figures reveal serious problems when compared against modern measurement standards. In particular, the THD of 0.27% significantly exceeds the "problematic level" of 0.1% and represents a level of distortion easily detectable by the human ear. It is incomparable to the "transparent level" of 0.01%. Although the S/N ratio of 110dB clears the transparent level of 105dB or above, such a high S/N ratio is meaningless when the distortion is this high. Compared to modern amplifiers from brands like Topping, which achieve THD+N figures below 0.001%, the fidelity of this unit must be described as remarkably low.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design, characterized by a massive investment in materials such as a single push-pull SEPP circuit using TO3 metal-can bipolar transistors and dual 700VA toroidal power transformers, shows a certain dedication. However, these technologies are not at all reflected in the final measured performance; in fact, they seem to degrade it. With modern high-performance semiconductor technology and signal processing, far superior performance can be achieved at a much lower cost. Since the implemented technology only achieves poor measurement results, it is outdated and irrational by modern standards. While its originality is acknowledged, the technology level is rated poorly.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

For a price of approximately 11,067 USD, its performance is exceptionally poor. For instance, a modern amplifier like the Topping PA7 (approx. 467 USD) overwhelmingly surpasses the A-3's measured performance in every aspect, with a THD+N of less than 0.0005% and an S/N ratio over 120dB. Given that a product with equivalent or superior performance exists for less than 1/25th of the price, the cost-performance of this product is practically non-existent. Based on the calculation (467 USD ÷ 11,067 USD ≈ 0.04), the score is 0.0. The expensive components and heavy chassis do not contribute to the goal of faithful sound reproduction and cannot justify the price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a Japanese manufacturer established in 2004, soulnote has a certain track record. A domestic sales network is in place, and the support system maintains standard levels. Industry-average responses can be expected for product warranties and repairs. However, as a relatively new manufacturer, long-term reliability data is limited. For a high-priced product, there are slight concerns about reliability compared to more established manufacturers, leading to an average score of 0.5.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The manufacturer's philosophy is clear, emphasizing unique transistors and a massive investment in materials. However, this philosophy deviates from the fundamental purpose of audio equipment—faithful sound reproduction—and leads to a significant degradation in measured performance. It is irrational to adhere to inefficient and outdated methods when modern scientific knowledge and technology can achieve higher performance more simply and at a lower cost. As reflected in the measurement results, the design philosophy lacks scientific rationality and receives an extremely low rating.

## Advice

The soulnote A-3, despite its price of approximately 11,067 USD, is significantly inferior in measured performance to modern amplifiers costing just a few tens of thousands of JPY. The THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) in particular is at a level unacceptable for an audio product, and faithful reproduction of the source material cannot be expected. When compared to products like the Topping PA7, there is no rational reason to choose the A-3, either in terms of performance or cost. Therefore, it is not recommended at all for users who are genuinely pursuing high-fidelity sound. It can be considered a product for a very small niche of enthusiasts who find personal value in the heavy chassis, specific components, or the brand's design philosophy, while disregarding objective data.
