summary: "A flagship SACD/CD player using four ES9038PRO DACs, a synchronized ultra-low-jitter master clock, and extensive digital inputs. Technical capability is high, but cost-performance is weak at 25,000 USD—equivalent alternatives exist for roughly half the price."

## Overview

The Soulnote S-3 Reference is the company’s statement Super Audio CD/CD player. It combines four ESS ES9038PRO DACs in a discrete no-feedback output stage, a transport synchronized to an ultra-low-jitter master clock, and unusually rich I/O: USB (×2), coaxial, AES/EBU, ZERO LINK, plus a 10 MHz external clock input. USB playback supports up to 768 kHz PCM and DSD512. These are manufacturer-published specifications and feature descriptions [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Key manufacturer specs meet or exceed transparency thresholds: analog frequency response 2 Hz–150 kHz (+0/−1 dB), THD 0.008 %, and S/N 110 dB. USB input supports up to 768 kHz PCM and 22.6 MHz DSD; the internal synchronized clocking (DDS LMX2594, claimed 45 fs) minimizes timing error from transport to DAC. Independent third-party bench data is scarce, so this score is based on catalog specs clearly labeled as such and will be updated if credible lab measurements appear [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The S-3 Reference shows sophisticated, original engineering: four ES9038PRO chips in a discrete no-feedback topology, transport and DAC synchronized to an ultra-low-jitter master clock, and proprietary ZERO LINK for DAC-side clocking in compatible ecosystems. The hardware platform also integrates high-bandwidth USB (to 768 kHz/DSD512) and a 10 MHz clock input. These reflect high in-house design depth and originality even if some elements exceed what’s audible [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For CP we must compare against the **cheapest equal-or-better** option in user-visible functions and measured specs. A fair functional match (SACD/CD transport, balanced analog outputs, USB DAC input, 10 MHz clock input, and equal-or-better published performance) is the **Esoteric K-05XD**: S/N 110 dB, THD 0.0007 %, USB DAC and 10 MHz clock input included [4]. The lowest current US new-unit price we could confirm is **13,000 USD** at an authorized dealer [5].  
**CP calculation:** 13,000 USD ÷ 25,000 USD = **0.52** → rounded to **0.5**.  
This indicates you can obtain equivalent functionality and (on paper) better distortion for about half the S-3’s price [4][5].

> Note: Disc-only players like McIntosh MCD350 (7,000 USD) are much cheaper but **lack** USB DAC and clock-input functions, so they’re not used as CP comparators. They can still be sensible if you only need SACD/CD playback [7].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Documented warranty for the S-3 main unit is **1 year**, with parts retention for **8 years** after end-of-production; both are stated in the official user manual [3]. As a precision disc mechanism, it has moving parts (higher wear risk) but robust construction. Soulnote announced the end of production for S-3 ver.2 (Reference) ordering in 2024, implying lifecycle maturity; parts support remains as above [6]. Absent longer warranty or extensive global service commitments, reliability/support lands slightly below average [3][6].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

From a hearing-significance standpoint, investing in four flagship DAC chips, external 10 MHz clocking, and proprietary transport-to-DAC links isn’t supported by clear audibility once transparent performance is already met. These choices advance engineering sophistication but provide limited evidence of audible improvement proportional to cost, so rationality is low despite the refined execution [1][2].

## Advice

If you specifically want a top-tier disc player **with** USB DAC and external clock input, Esoteric’s K-05XD delivers equivalent functions and stronger published distortion numbers at roughly **52 %** of the S-3’s price, making it the rational pick for most buyers [4][5]. If you only need SACD/CD playback, a disc-only machine like McIntosh’s MCD350 lowers spend dramatically (but omits DAC/clock features) [7]. The S-3 Reference remains compelling for Soulnote ecosystem users (e.g., ZERO LINK, X-3 clock) who value its design philosophy and integration above strict value metrics.
