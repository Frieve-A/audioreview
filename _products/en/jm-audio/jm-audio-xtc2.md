## Overview

JM Audio XTC2 is an open-back dynamic headphone featuring 50mm beryllium drivers and custom tuning by founder John Massaria. The headphones utilize 110mm ear cups with a "wedge horn like edge" design and African Blackwood construction. Available in multiple impedance options (32Ω, 64Ω, 300Ω), the XTC2 includes patent-pending "JM Audio Fractal Porous Graphene Carbon" and "JM Audio Fractal Fiberglass Mesh" technologies. JM Audio Editions is a New York-based startup specializing in custom-tuned headphones with comprehensive testing procedures before shipment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Despite extensive testing claims including frequency response, THD, spectral flatness, and driver matching measurements, no actual measurement data is publicly available for scientific evaluation. Only basic manufacturer specifications such as impedance (32-300Ω) and sensitivity (112-114 dB SPL) are provided without third-party verification. Following framework guidelines for products with manufacturer specifications only but no published measurements, a conservative baseline assessment of 0.5 is applied. Claims regarding sound characteristics like "deep tight bass" and "never harsh" cannot be scientifically validated without objective measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The XTC2 incorporates patent-pending proprietary materials including "JM Audio Fractal Porous Graphene Carbon" and "JM Audio Fractal Fiberglass Mesh," representing some technological innovation. The in-house design by founder John Massaria and beryllium driver implementation demonstrate technical competence. However, the technology level is limited by the startup's small scale, purely analog/mechanical approach without digital integration, and limited market adoption of the claimed proprietary materials. The beryllium driver technology represents established rather than cutting-edge implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

At 1,195 USD, the XTC2 faces significant competition from more affordable alternatives offering equivalent or superior documented performance. The FiiO FT1 Pro provides comparable open-back functionality with planar magnetic drivers and published third-party measurements at 200 USD [6]. Equipped with equivalent functions (open-back design, high-performance drivers), and frequency response range and harmonic distortion performance are documented as equivalent-or-better through independent measurements. CP = 200 USD ÷ 1,195 USD = 0.17.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JM Audio provides comprehensive support including full warranty, lifetime re-tuning service, and free headband replacement within the first year. The simple dynamic driver construction with robust materials offers inherently reliable design. Direct manufacturer support from the New York headquarters enables responsive customer service. The extensive testing procedures before shipment (frequency response, THD, driver matching, phase checking) demonstrate quality control commitment, though the company's limited track record as a startup prevents higher scoring.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While JM Audio emphasizes comprehensive testing procedures including frequency response and harmonic distortion measurements, the lack of published measurement data limits scientific validation of their approach. The 1,195 USD pricing appears primarily driven by exotic materials (beryllium drivers, African Blackwood) and custom tuning rather than demonstrable performance advantages. The conservative analog-only approach without digital integration or modern connectivity features represents traditional rather than innovative design philosophy. The substantial cost investment in premium materials lacks proportional technical advancement or published performance validation.

## Advice

The JM Audio XTC2 targets audiophiles seeking custom-tuned open-back headphones with premium materials and personalized service. Potential buyers should consider the limited availability of objective performance data when evaluating the 1,195 USD investment. Those prioritizing documented measurements and established performance credentials may find significantly better value in alternatives like the FiiO FT1 Pro (200 USD), HiFiMAN Sundara (299 USD), or HiFiMAN Edition XS (269 USD), all offering published third-party measurements and proven performance at substantially lower prices. The comprehensive testing procedures and lifetime re-tuning service appeal to users valuing ongoing manufacturer support, though the premium pricing requires careful consideration against alternatives offering superior cost-performance ratios.
