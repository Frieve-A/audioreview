## Overview

The Spendor D9.2 is a 3-way, four-driver floorstanding loudspeaker positioned as an evolution of the D9 with updated cabinet damping and porting. It features twin 180 mm woofers, a dedicated 180 mm midrange, and a 22 mm LPZ tweeter in a hand-built, asymmetrically braced enclosure. Spendor (founded 1969) has long served studio monitoring and high-end domestic markets.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications report a typical in-room response of 27 Hz–25 kHz, 90 dB/1 W/1 m sensitivity, 8 Ω nominal impedance (min 4.6 Ω), and crossover points at 500 Hz/4.2 kHz [1]. Independent, full spinorama/NFS data for D9.2 has not been published as of this writing. As context, Stereophile’s lab work on the related Spendor D7 showed above-average neutrality and benign impedance behavior for the brand’s designs, but those results cannot be assumed for the D9.2 without direct measurements [6]. Until third-party data appears, claims about distortion, directivity, and compression remain provisional based on catalog specs [1][6].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The D9.2 uses an asymmetric-braced cabinet with **Dynamic Damping**, and a **5th-generation Linear-Flow tapered twin-venturi reflex port** intended to reduce turbulence. Driver set comprises an LPZ 22 mm polyamide-dome tweeter, 18 cm EP77 polymer-cone midrange, and dual 18 cm Kevlar-composite woofers. Crossover networks are precisely matched on dual-layer boards. These are solid, rational engineering choices with some proprietary elements; they are competent rather than groundbreaking by contemporary measurement-driven standards [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

At **14,998 USD** for the pair [5], you can achieve equivalent-or-better user-facing functionality and objectively strong measured performance for far less with the **Arendal 1723 Tower S** (**3,199 USD/pair**, direct) [2]. NRC anechoic measurements for the Tower S show a smooth listening-window response, controlled directivity, and low THD at 90/95 dB tests—evidence of high-fidelity reproduction at a much lower price [3].  
**Equivalence note:** both are full-range passive floorstanders; independent lab data for the Arendal indicates comparable/better linearity and low mid/high-band distortion [3].  
**CP calculation:** 3,199 USD ÷ 14,998 USD = **0.213** → **0.2**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Spendor offers UK manufacturing with a 5-year warranty and established dealer support. While field failure statistics aren’t public, build execution and parts sourcing are consistent with premium British brands. Support depth varies by region; availability is strongest in the UK/EU.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Targeting neutral reproduction via controlled cabinet behavior, disciplined porting, and conventional but well-implemented drivers is a sensible path. However, without publicly available third-party D9.2 measurements, it’s unclear whether the execution reaches the transparent benchmark that lower-priced competitors already demonstrate in labs.

## Advice

Choose the D9.2 if you prioritize British craftsmanship and finish and are comfortable paying a premium absent modern third-party measurement evidence. If objective fidelity per dollar is the goal, short-list models with strong published lab data such as Arendal 1723 Tower S; also consider well-measured designs from Revel, KEF, etc., based on current availability and room needs [2][3][4].
