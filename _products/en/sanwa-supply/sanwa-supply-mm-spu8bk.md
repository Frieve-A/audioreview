## Overview

$$ \Large \text{1.7} $$

The Sanwa Supply MM-SPU8BK is a compact, single-cable USB speaker (USB audio + power over one USB-A plug) rated at 3W practical output with 2-inch full-range drivers in sealed enclosures (66×60×66mm). It targets the simplest PC audio use where plug-and-play convenience matters more than fidelity [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Manufacturer specs list a 180 Hz–20 kHz frequency response and 3W (1.5W+1.5W) output [1]. The complete omission of content below 180 Hz removes fundamental bass information and limits realism for music and video. With small sealed 2-inch drivers and low power, the product falls well short of transparency benchmarks for desktop speakers. Independent third-party lab measurements could not be found; evaluation here relies on manufacturer specifications [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The design is a straightforward USB audio device with a basic internal DAC, sealed 2-inch full-range drivers, and rear volume control—no advertised DSP, acoustic correction, or novel transducer technology. It reflects an off-the-shelf implementation rather than original engineering [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Price basis (review target):** 17 USD (AXEL Global listing for MM-SPU8BK; model noted as discontinued) [3].  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator found:** Creative Pebble V2 (USB-powered 2.0 speakers; 8W RMS, 100–17,000 Hz manufacturer specs) at 24 USD (Newegg) [4][5]. From a user perspective both are compact USB-powered 2.0 desktop speakers; Pebble V2 provides clearly superior output and low-frequency extension (equal-or-better performance) [4]. No cheaper product with equal-or-better functions and performance was found as of the review date, so the MM-SPU8BK is treated as the cheapest option meeting its (lower) performance level → **CP = 1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A major retailer lists MM-SPU8BK as **discontinued** (“生産完了品”), which typically reduces long-term parts availability and support prospects [3]. This category has no firmware updates by design [2]. Sanwa Direct operates a 1-year store program for eligible items, but product-specific global support details for MM-SPU8BK are not documented [6]. Given discontinuation and minimal construction, we assign a low support score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Prioritizing a single-cable hookup and minimal cost over measurable fidelity leads to narrow bandwidth (≥180 Hz) and low output, which are well below thresholds associated with transparent desktop playback. The approach is simple and convenient but does not pursue engineering choices that measurably improve audibility (e.g., extended bass via enclosure tuning, passive radiators, or DSP) [1][2].

## Advice

Consider MM-SPU8BK only if you need the **absolute minimum** plug-and-play audio for system sounds or voice calls. Music, movies, and games benefit from alternatives with greater output and bass extension. Within compact 2.0 speakers, Creative Pebble V2 delivers substantially better specs and remains inexpensive [4][5]. Expect to spend more if you want performance approaching neutral response and adequate dynamics.
