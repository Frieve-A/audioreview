## Overview

The Sanwa Supply 400-SP027 is a simple 2.0 powered desktop speaker system for PC/TV use. Manufacturer documentation specifies built-in AC power, a 3.5 mm analog input, a front headphone jack (bypass), magnetic shielding, and 2.5-inch full-range drivers in a bass-reflex enclosure. Published specs state 10 W “maximum practical output” (5 W+5 W) and a 130 Hz–20 kHz frequency response [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

No third-party lab measurements (frequency response deviation, THD, SNR, etc.) are available. Based on manufacturer specs: 130 Hz–20 kHz response, 10 W max (5 W+5 W), 4 Ω load, AC power [1][2]. A 130 Hz lower limit implies most bass is not reproduced: the 20–130 Hz band (~2.7 octaves) is effectively outside the specified range, so transparent full-band playback is not expected for music/movie content. Combined with the small 2.5-inch drivers and lack of published measurement curves, we reduce the provisional score below the 0.5 baseline.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design uses conventional analog amplification with a bass-reflex, magnetically-shielded 2.5-inch full-range driver per channel, front volume control, AUX input, and headphone jack. There is no DSP, room correction, or wireless functionality. Implementation aligns with standard off-the-shelf budget 2.0 powered speakers rather than proprietary innovation [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Price basis (review target):** 25 USD.  
**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better found):** LENRUE A39PRO USB-powered soundbar claiming 10 W (2×5 W) stereo output with 3.5 mm analog input and headphone support; functions match and claimed output is equal, with no inferior core specs disclosed (third-party measurements unavailable; manufacturer-spec comparison) [5].

**Calculation:** CP = 21.87 USD ÷ 25 USD = 0.8748 → **0.9** (rounded to one decimal).  
If lower verified prices appear for equal-or-better products, CP should be updated accordingly.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The included warranty is **6 months** from purchase per the official manual and listings—shorter than the common 1–2 years seen for desktop speakers [1][3]. The simple analog design suggests low intrinsic complexity, but the short warranty term and primarily Japan-focused support keep the score below average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The feature set prioritizes practical basics (built-in PSU to avoid USB power dependence, magnetic shielding for placement near displays, and a front headphone jack) without adding non-essential costs. This pragmatic approach is sensible for entry-level desktop audio where advanced features would not measurably improve fidelity at this performance tier [1][2].

## Advice

Choose the 400-SP027 if you want an inexpensive, AC-powered 2.0 speaker with analog 3.5 mm input and a front headphone jack. Be aware that bass extension (spec’d to 130 Hz) and overall fidelity are limited versus larger or better-measured speakers; the 20–130 Hz region (~2.7 octaves) will be largely missing. If you simply need basic stereo sound as cheaply as possible, the LENRUE A39PRO offers similar functions and claimed output at a lower price, albeit also without published third-party measurements [5]. If you prefer a widely reviewed alternative with clearer published specs, consider Creative Pebble V2 (8 W RMS, 100 Hz–17 kHz, typically higher price) [4].
