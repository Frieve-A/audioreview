## Overview

The Sanwa Supply MM-SPU7BK is a compact USB-powered 2.0 desktop speaker set with wooden enclosures and passive radiators. A single USB connection carries power and digital audio, with conversion performed inside the speakers. Sanwa lists 5 W practical output (2.5 W Ã— 2) and a 130 Hz-20 kHz frequency response, clearly indicating constrained bass capability for music playback [1]. This model targets basic PC audio where simplicity and low price matter more than absolute fidelity.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

From a measurement-first perspective, the specified 130 Hz lower limit leaves a substantial portion of the musical fundamentals unreproduced; modern desktop speakers aiming at fuller bandwidth commonly state 100 Hz or lower. Power is modest at 5 W total. Key transparency indicators (THD/THD+N, SNR, crosstalk, dynamic range) are not published by the manufacturer, so we cannot confirm linearity or noise performance beyond catalog claims [1]. Given the narrow bandwidth and low output, audible performance sits around the problematic border for speakers per our criteria, even with passive radiators helping bass within the small cabinet's constraints.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The architecture is conventional: small full-range drivers in sealed wooden cabinets with passive radiators and a basic USB DAC/amp stage. There is no evidence of DSP-based EQ, room/desk compensation, or proprietary acoustic innovations. While the wood cabinet is sensible and the USB audio path is practical, the overall design reflects mature, low-cost techniques rather than modern advances [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price for the MM-SPU7BK is about 25 USD (derived from 26 USD at major JP retailers on 2025-08-30) [2][3]. As an equal-or-better reference, Creative Pebble V2 offers the same 2.0 USB operation with clearly superior catalog specs (frequency response 100 Hz-17 kHz; 8 W RMS) [4], but typical US market pricing we verified is 37.99 USD [5]. We found no product with **equal or better** user-visible functions and **equal or better** published performance metrics below the MM-SPU7BK's price at review time. Therefore, it is the cheapest option among equivalents, and CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sanwa Supply provides established domestic support in Japan and publishes manuals and compatibility information for long-running models [1]. The design's simplicity (no firmware features to maintain) and bus-powered operation reduce failure points. Global support may be more limited versus worldwide brands, and there is no documented long-term failure data. Overall, expected reliability aligns with mainstream budget desktop speakers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The product direction is pragmatic: simple USB connectivity, wood cabinets, and passive radiators used within realistic limits. Marketing language largely avoids non-scientific claims and publishes concrete basics like bandwidth and output [1]. However, the absence of modern processing or clear measurement targets beyond catalog specs limits how far the design pushes fidelity and efficiency.

## Advice

If you need the lowest verified-spec USB desktop speakers for alerts, voice, and casual listening, the MM-SPU7BK is acceptable and very cheap to own. If you want noticeably fuller bass and louder clean output, stepping up to Creative Pebble V2 (100 Hz low-end, 8 W RMS) is a straightforward upgrade-albeit at a higher market price we confirmed in the US [4][5]. For music-first use, consider headphones or larger powered speakers that can meet -3 dB targets over a wider band.
