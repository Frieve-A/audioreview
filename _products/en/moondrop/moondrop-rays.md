## Overview

The Moondrop Rays is a gaming-oriented in-ear monitor released in 2025 by Chinese manufacturer Moondrop. It features a hybrid configuration combining a 10mm sapphire-coated diaphragm dynamic driver with a 6mm ring-shaped planar magnetic driver, and incorporates USB-C connectivity with built-in DSP gaming sound card functionality. Positioned as the company's first gaming model, it includes AI voice enhancement algorithms with noise canceling capability and visual multipoint parametric EQ adjustment features. Priced at 110 USD in the US market, it was developed through collaboration with professional gamers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Total harmonic distortion measures below 0.05% at 1kHz, meeting the excellent standards for IEM products. Frequency response claims a wide bandwidth of 7Hz-39kHz, with effective bandwidth achieving within -3dB from 20Hz-20kHz. Sensitivity of 120dB/Vrms ensures sufficient output levels, while 30Î© impedance suits general-purpose equipment driving. The hybrid configuration combines dynamic driver low-frequency reproduction capability with planar magnetic driver high-frequency characteristics. DSP processing is expected to improve signal quality, though specific S/N ratio and crosstalk values are not disclosed. Performance within measurable ranges is good, but achieving transparent levels remains partially unclear.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The hybrid driver configuration is technically sophisticated, with the 10mm dynamic driver employing a sapphire-coated diaphragm combined with a 6mm ring-shaped planar magnetic driver demonstrating design originality. USB-C connectivity with a built-in DSP sound card using 4-layer gold-plated circuit boards and precision-designed components represents advanced industry implementation. NPU integration executing AI voice enhancement algorithms demonstrates technical advancement beyond conventional ENC. Visual multipoint parametric EQ functionality enables detailed adjustment of filter type, gain, Q-value, and frequency. These technologies demonstrate progressiveness exceeding current industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Alternative products with equivalent or superior functionality and measurement performance include the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds (220 USD), HyperX Cloud Mix Buds 2 (165 USD), and Razer Hammerhead Pro HyperSpeed (220 USD). All these products feature USB-C connectivity with DSP processing, gaming optimization, and digital signal processing capabilities. Among these, the most affordable alternative is the HyperX Cloud Mix Buds 2 at 165 USD. However, the Moondrop Rays is priced even lower. As it is the lowest-priced product in the world offering equivalent functionality and measurement performance, it achieves a perfect cost-performance score of 1.0. As a product integrating DSP functionality, AI voice enhancement, parametric EQ, and USB-C sound card features, it achieves exceptionally excellent pricing.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Moondrop is a relatively new manufacturer established in 2015, but has established an industry position through hit products like the Aria, Starfield, and Blessing. Specific failure rate data is not publicly available, but market evaluation of the company's products is generally favorable. The warranty period is standard, with support systems established through authorized distributors in the US market. Regarding firmware update support, future updates are expected for DSP-equipped products, but long-term support policies are not clearly defined. As an emerging manufacturer, it maintains industry-average support systems, but long-term reliability requires an accumulated track record.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy specialized for gaming applications is scientifically rational. DSP signal processing, AI voice enhancement, and parametric EQ functionality all represent technologies with measurable sound quality improvement effects. The hybrid driver configuration is a rational approach utilizing each driver's physical characteristics. USB-C connectivity enables high-quality signal processing without battery-driven constraints through external power supply. Software adjustment functionality enables optimization according to user preferences and applications. However, for general music listening, these specialized features are not necessarily required, and simpler high-quality driver designs may be more rational in some cases. The specialization for gaming applications demonstrates a clear direction.

## Advice

The Moondrop Rays is a high-quality IEM specialized for gaming applications, featuring excellent measurement performance and advanced technology. For competitive gaming and streaming where sound positioning and voice communication quality are critical, users will benefit from its DSP functionality and AI voice enhancement. Compared to competing products with equivalent functionality (SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, HyperX Cloud Mix Buds 2, Razer Hammerhead Pro HyperSpeed), it achieves the lowest price, with 110 USD representing exceptionally excellent cost-performance. For gamers seeking advanced features like DSP processing, parametric EQ, and AI voice enhancement, this represents the most rational choice currently available in the market. While USB-C connectivity enables smartphone use, PC environments are preferable for full DSP functionality utilization. For pure music listening applications where gaming-specific features are unnecessary, considering more affordable alternatives is recommended.
