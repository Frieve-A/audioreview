rating: [2.6, 0.6, 0.7, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6]
price: 899
summary: "A technically ambitious open-back planar whose measured tuning leans mid-forward with light bass, solid treble behavior, heavy build, and mixed ergonomics. Compelling for detail and midrange clarity, but cost-performance is weak against cheaper planars with equal-or-better measured results."

## Overview

Cosmo is MOONDROP’s flagship open-back planar magnetic over-ear. It uses a 100 mm diaphragm (~0.5 µm substrate) with a pure-silver etched circuit (“Full Drive Technology”), low nominal impedance, and includes a 4.4 mm balanced cable. Independent measurements indicate a mid-forward presentation with comparatively light bass and generally well-behaved treble. The chassis is all-metal and quite heavy for the category. The US market price sits at 899 USD [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specs: 15 Ω impedance, 100 dB/Vrms sensitivity, and 13 Hz–58 kHz bandwidth [1]. Third-party data measured on industry-standard rigs shows: (a) bass extension is flat but level is low relative to mids; (b) lower mids are near DF-neutral up to ~800 Hz; (c) a ~1 kHz rise and a dip around ~2 kHz; (d) upper-mid/treble are comparatively well controlled without sharp peaks [2]. Independent measurements also report ~17 Ω measured impedance, ~99 dB/Vrms sensitivity, and mass ~547 g for the unit tested [3]. Taken together, Cosmo’s fidelity is decent—clean, articulate mids/treble—but not class-leading neutrality due to mid emphasis and bass lightness [2][3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Cosmo employs a nanoscale (~500 nm) low-tension diaphragm, a pure-silver etched conductive film, phase-control waveguides, and a tension-balancing scheme intended to reduce nonlinear distortion and improve consistency [1]. These are sophisticated design elements typical of modern planars. However, available measurements do not show a clear leap in audible results over peers; the tech is strong but not uniquely transformative [2][3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

US market price: 899 USD (Cosmo) [2][3]. Cheapest proven equal-or-better alternative by user-facing function (open-back planar) and measured neutrality/consistency is the HiFiMAN Edition XS at 269 USD (current list) with excellent target compliance metrics (e.g., bass RMS dev. 2.3 dB; mid RMS dev. 1.67 dB; treble RMS dev. 1.59 dB) [4].  
**Calculation (USD):** 269 ÷ 899 = 0.299 → **0.3**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Build uses substantial metal parts and a heavy cable; multiple reviewers note headband sizing/adjustment issues and unstable fit for small/medium heads [2]. Warranty terms are not clearly stated by the manufacturer at a global level; one large retailer lists two-year coverage for Cosmo purchases through them (retailer policy), while other MOONDROP after-sales documents/products commonly indicate ~1-year coverage—indicating region/retailer variance rather than a uniform 2-year manufacturer term [1][5][6]. With unclear global warranty and mixed ergonomics, we score slightly below the 0.5 “average” baseline.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

MOONDROP’s direction (very thin diaphragm, silver etched traces, waveguides) is rational insofar as it targets measurable control of diaphragm behavior [1]. Yet the heavy chassis and accessory choices (single 4.4 mm cable, limited adjustability) do not translate into clearly superior measured fidelity versus lighter, cheaper competitors [2][4]. The approach is serious but not efficiency-optimized for user outcomes.

## Advice

If you value midrange clarity and treble smoothness more than bass weight—and have a large head or can pad/strap-mod—Cosmo can be satisfying. For most readers seeking neutral open-back planars backed by strong measurements at a lower cost, Edition XS is a safer starting point [2][4]. If you go Cosmo, plan on slight EQ (bass shelf, ~1 kHz trim, modest 2 kHz lift) and consider lighter aftermarket cables or headstrap mods to improve comfort [2][3].
