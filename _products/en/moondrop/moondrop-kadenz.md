## Overview

The Moondrop Kadenz is a single dynamic driver in-ear monitor launched in 2024 as the latest model in the company's K-series. It features 10mm ULT Gen2 patent technology and a TAC (tetrahedral amorphous carbon) diamond-coated composite diaphragm, delivering a warmer, listening-focused sound signature compared to previous models like the Kato and Aria 2. The included ECHO-B USB-C dongle incorporates a high-performance DAC achieving excellent measurements of SNR 120dB and THD 0.003%. The current market price is around 180 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Kadenz achieves an excellent level of measured performance for a single dynamic driver IEM. The earphone's THD+N is below 0.03%, clearing the excellent threshold of โค0.05% for headphones and earphones. The effective frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (IEC60318-4, -3dB) falls within standard ranges, and the sensitivity of 122dB/Vrms ensures adequate output levels. The included ECHO-B DAC achieves an SNR of 120dB, THD of 0.003%, and a dynamic range of 120dB, clearing transparent levels across all metrics. This results in a design where scientifically verifiable audio quality improvements in the audible range are confirmed.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The combination of ULT Gen2 patent technology and a TAC diamond-coated diaphragm showcases Moondrop's technical expertise and proprietary design. Compared to the Super-Linear technology used in the previous Kato model, Gen2 introduces a newly developed pressure balance channel to improve driver linearity. The TAC diamond coating is an advanced approach that balances diaphragm rigidity and light weight. However, the single dynamic driver configuration is relatively simple in design, and its technical complexity is limited compared to multi-driver systems or cutting-edge approaches like PZT electrostatic technology. It represents a solid technical level above the industry average, but there is room for improvement in terms of innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This product, with an actual market price of 180 USD, includes a high-performance USB-C DAC. An alternative with comparable performance is a combination of the DUNU Titan S (approx. 73 USD) and a USB-C DAC with equal or better measured performance (e.g., FiiO KA11, approx. 30 USD). The total price for this combination is about 103 USD. The cost-performance calculation is 103 USD รท 180 USD = 0.57, leading to a score of 0.6. Even when considering the value of the included DAC, the existence of alternatives allowing users to achieve equivalent functionality at a lower cost means its cost-performance is only slightly above the industry average.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Moondrop is an established Chinese audio brand with a good track record in the international market. The product's initial defect rate is at an industry-average level, and the brand is generally recognized as reliable within user communities. In Japan, a sales structure through authorized distributors provides standard warranty periods and after-sales support. While firmware updates do not apply to this product, physical quality control is stable. It maintains an industry-average level of reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design approach of the Kadenz shows a rational direction based on scientific measurements. It focuses on achieving transparent levels in objective metrics such as THD, SNR, and frequency response, concentrating technical investment on measurable improvements in sound quality. The ULT Gen2 technology has a clear technical goal of improving linearity, and the TAC diamond coating also contributes to the physical improvement of the diaphragm's performance. The high SNR and low THD of the included DAC also reflect a scientific approach. On the other hand, there is room for improvement in that the listening-focused tuning deviates slightly from scientific standards like the Harman target, and the pricing is not optimized relative to its measured performance.

## Advice

While the Moondrop Kadenz is a technically excellent IEM, we strongly recommend a careful consideration of its cost-performance before purchase. For its price of 180 USD, one could, for example, combine the DUNU Titan S (approx. 73 USD) with a high-performance USB-C DAC (approx. 30 USD) to enjoy equivalent or superior performance for about 103 USD. Investing the remaining budget in other equipment could lead to a better overall improvement in sound quality. The Kadenz should be chosen only if there is a strong preference for Moondrop's specific sound signature and if the convenience of the bundled DAC is a priority. For those who prioritize a balance of objective performance and price, choosing a more affordable alternative configuration is the rational decision.
