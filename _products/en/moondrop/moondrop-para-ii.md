## Overview

Moondrop’s Para II is a second-generation full-size open-back planar magnetic headphone built around a 100 mm diaphragm and the company’s FDT (Full Drive Tech) motor. The design adds an N55 magnet array optimized via FEA, a 1.2 μm ultra-thin diaphragm, and a secondary diaphragm stress-balance structure in a lighter stainless-steel chassis. Priced at 499 USD, it targets the mid-tier planar segment with a “scientific tuning” approach and easy-drive specs (9 Ω, high sensitivity) [2][5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Manufacturer specifications claim THD ≤ 0.03% at 1 kHz/94 dB and list 9 Ω impedance with 106 dB/Vrms sensitivity [2]. Independent measurements from UnheardLab show higher mid/treble distortion at 94 dB SPL—roughly 0.2–0.5% between ~1.5–8 kHz—while noting the rise appears limited to one channel on the tested unit; the other channel measures very low, implying potential unit variance [1]. Given that ~0.5% THD in the critical midrange approaches a problematic region for headphones, we consider the scientific validity mixed. Effective frequency response coverage is 20 Hz–20 kHz (−3 dB) by manufacturer data [2], and UnheardLab reports measured sensitivity around 110 dB/Vrms [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Para II incorporates modern, in-house technologies: a 1.2 μm thin diaphragm, an N55 magnet array modeled via FEA for field uniformity, and a secondary diaphragm stress-balance mechanism, all under Moondrop’s FDT motor architecture. The stainless-steel, magnetically attached pad system and included balanced 4.4 mm cable round out a technically sophisticated build for the class [2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comparator (equivalence basis): HiFiMAN Edition XS—also an open-back planar with neutral-leaning response and comparable distortion performance per RTINGS’ Test Bench 2.0 harmonic-distortion evaluation (same order of magnitude in the mids at reference levels) [4]. Current official price observed for Edition XS is 269 USD [3].  
**CP calculation:** 269 USD ÷ 499 USD = 0.539 → **0.5**.  
Para II’s proprietary motor/diaphragm work is appreciable, but at street prices the XS delivers similar user-facing performance for significantly less.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Build quality is robust with a brushed stainless-steel frame, magnetic sheepskin pads, and a dual-3.5 mm ear-cup interface. A balanced 4.4 mm cable and 3.5 mm adapter are included. Warranty and support are handled through standard Moondrop channels and authorized retailers; nothing notably above industry average is advertised.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Moondrop’s engineering choices (FEA-optimized N55 magnets, 1.2 μm diaphragm, stress-balance scheme) are rational, measurement-driven paths to lower non-linear behavior and predictable tuning [2]. However, third-party data suggests sonic gains over the original are incremental and may be unit-dependent, tempering the realized outcome despite sound technical intent [1][2].

## Advice

If you want a well-built, easy-to-drive planar with balanced tonality and minimal EQ fuss, the Para II is a safe pick. If your priority is value per measurable performance, consider the HiFiMAN Edition XS at 269 USD as a baseline comparator; it offers similar user-facing performance for less [3][4]. For users sensitive to treble grain or seeking more bass impact, pad rolling (Para II/Cosmo pads) or modest EQ—as documented by third-party testing—can help [1].
