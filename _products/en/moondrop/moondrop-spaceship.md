## Overview

The Moondrop Spaceship is a compact bullet-style in-ear monitor using a single 6 mm dynamic driver. It launched as one of Moondrop’s cheapest wired IEMs around 20 USD and features a fixed cable. As of this writing, it is no longer listed among current Moondrop products and major retailers mark it as discontinued, which constrains availability and support for new buyers [3][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party frequency-response data shows a pronounced upper-mid/low-treble rise (≈2–4 kHz), which tends to introduce shout or harshness; bass extension is modest for a sealed IEM. These traits limit transparency versus neutral targets [1]. No reliable third-party THD/IMD datasets were located. Manufacturer specifications list 16 Ω impedance, 104 dB sensitivity, and THD < 1 % at 1 kHz (spec conditions only), which indicate easy drivability from phones/dongles but do not alter the FR-driven conclusion [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Implementation is conventional: a 6 mm micro dynamic driver (PU & PEEK diaphragm per catalog), stainless-style bullet housing, and a fixed 3.5 mm cable. There is no evidence of proprietary acoustics, novel materials, or patent-backed mechanisms that would differentiate it from modern budget peers [2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Review-target price: 20 USD. The cheapest **equivalent-or-better** current option is the 7Hz Salnotes Zero at 19.99 USD, which offers a detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable and more linear FR per IEC-711 measurements—meeting or exceeding user-visible functions and measured performance [5][6].  
**Calculation:** 19.99 USD ÷ 20 USD = **1.0** (rounded to one decimal).  
Because a cheaper equivalent exists, CP rounds to 1.0 under the site’s rules.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The model is discontinued (not present on Moondrop’s current catalog and listed “Discontinued” by retailers), which reduces forward support paths [3][4]. Moondrop-brand IEM warranty is typically 1 year via authorized dealers, shorter than the “3 years+” seen from some competitors; the fixed cable also raises failure risk with no easy replacement [7][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A simple, cost-optimized bullet IEM is rational; however, the measured upper-mid elevation works against transparent reproduction goals. Prioritizing detachable cabling and neutral FR—as seen on current budget leaders—would better align with measurement-first design [1][6].

## Advice

Given the discontinued status and fixed cable, the Spaceship is a poor choice for new purchases. For similar money, the 7Hz Salnotes Zero provides detachable cabling and a more neutral response backed by measurements [5][6]. If you prefer to stay within Moondrop, the CHU II remains an actively sold entry with replaceable cable; independent reviews confirm competent tuning and ease of drive, though typical street prices often exceed 20 USD [8]. Existing Spaceship owners sensitive to upper-mid glare may mitigate with narrow-band EQ around ~3 kHz and ensure a deep seal to maximize bass extension [1].
