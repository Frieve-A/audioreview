summary: "A revolutionary product that shook the IEM market in 2020. With its 1DD+4BA configuration at $320, it provided performance comparable to $1000 IEMs of its era, causing industry-wide price disruption. Measurement performance is excellent, particularly the natural midrange reproduction. However, after 4 years, numerous competitors like Truthear Nova ($169.99) offer equal or superior performance at approximately half the price, severely degrading its cost-performance ratio."

## Overview

The Moondrop Blessing 2 is a hybrid in-ear monitor featuring a 1DD+4BA configuration, released in 2020. Despite its $320 price point, it achieved sound quality comparable to $1000 IEMs of its time, earning the nickname "kilobuck killer" and shocking the industry. It incorporates five drivers including Knowles SWFK, Softears D-MID-A, and a 10mm paper diaphragm dynamic driver. The frequency response covers 9-37KHz with 22ฮฉ@1kHz impedance and 117dB/Vrms sensitivity.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

From a measurement perspective, the Blessing 2 demonstrates objectively excellent performance. The THD<1%@1kHz distortion specification is sufficiently low for its price category. The frequency response faithfully follows Moondrop's VDSF (Virtual Diffuse Sound Field) target, with particularly natural midrange reproduction both in measurements and perceived audio quality. However, a peak exists around 5kHz, creating slight treble brightness. ABX testing confirms audible differences from other $300-class IEMs, establishing scientifically valid performance distinctions.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 5-driver hybrid configuration was advanced for 2020 standards. The 3D-printed medical-grade resin housing enables precise acoustic design. The 3-way crossover network design is appropriate, leveraging each driver's characteristics to achieve desired acoustic properties. However, from current technical standards, no particularly innovative elements are apparent. Technical limitations exist, including minor distortion from BA drivers at high frequencies and compression at extreme volumes.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The Blessing 2's current price is $320. However, with the existence of the Truthear Nova ($169.99) offering equal or superior performance, CP = $169.99 รท $320 = 0.53. Furthermore, numerous alternatives under $200 exist, including Simgot EM6L, Binary Acoustics x Gizaudio Chopin, and Kiwi Ears Quintet, all offering excellent Harman-target compliance. The Truthear Nova, dubbed "baby Variations," provides Harman tuning equivalent to the $520 Moondrop Variations for only $169.99. While acknowledging its revolutionary value four years ago, it is clearly overpriced in today's market.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Moondrop has established a reasonable track record as a Chinese audio equipment manufacturer with standard quality control. The 0.78mm 2-pin connector adoption enables easy cable replacement. However, the warranty period is standard at one year, with no particularly extended support offerings. RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) response is standard, with no reports of exceptionally superior failure rates.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design philosophy of adhering to the VDSF target curve is scientifically sound. Measurement-based acoustic design is rational, prioritizing objective reproduction over subjective "musicality." However, as of 2024, equivalent design philosophies can be implemented at much lower costs with established technology. The $320 price point lacks rationality considering current market conditions. Additionally, the large housing creates fit issues for many users, questioning the design's universal applicability.

## Advice

While the Blessing 2 was historically significant, it cannot be recommended for purchase in 2024 due to numerous products offering equal or superior performance at lower prices. The Truthear Nova ($169.99) particularly provides equivalent Harman tuning and excellent technical performance at approximately half the price. With a $300 budget, consider newer "New Meta" tuning products like the Moondrop Blessing 3 ($320) or DUNU x Gizaudio DaVinci ($300). The only reason to consider purchasing the Blessing 2 would be for collection purposes, owning a revolutionary product from 2020.
