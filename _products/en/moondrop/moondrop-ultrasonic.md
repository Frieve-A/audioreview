summary: "The Moondrop ULTRASONIC, priced at 74.99 USD, features a 13mm TiN ceramic-coated dome composite diaphragm + FRA treble BA hybrid design, LDAC support, and ANC. Based on public specifications and third-party reports, it is a solid, rational implementation. Considering physical limits of isolation and ANC, scientific validity is moderate, while overall cost-performance is strong."

## Overview

The Moondrop ULTRASONIC is a True Wireless earphone released in 2024 by Moondrop. At 74.99 USD, it features a hybrid configuration combining a 13mm TiN ceramic-coated dome composite diaphragm dynamic driver and an FRA direct-radiating treble BA, LDAC support, and active noise cancellation. It adopts Moondrop's proprietary VDSF (Virtual Diffuse Sound Field) tuning with measurement-driven acoustic design.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Considering public specifications and credible third-party reports, the implementation is reasonable for audible transparency. The hybrid design with VDSF-oriented tuning and LDAC (24bit/96kHz, up to 990kbps) reduces transmission bottlenecks. However, physical constraints of TWS (fit-dependent passive isolation and microphone/packaging limits for ANC) remain; thus real-world audible improvement is moderate. Product-specific comprehensive lab measurements are limited in public domain, so overstated claims should be avoided.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The 13mm TiN ceramic-coated dome composite dynamic + FRA direct-radiating BA hybrid, Bluetooth 5.3, LDAC/LC3 support, and 55ms low-latency mode are well-implemented, above standard for current TWS. Approaches such as ear canal simulation for treble optimization are acoustically rational. However, most building blocks are established technologies; disruptive originality is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

For equivalent user-oriented functionality and real-world performance (ANC + LDAC + usable app/telephony), a cheaper alternative is SoundPEATS Capsule3 Pro at 69.99 USD. Using actual market prices: 69.99 USD ÷ 74.99 USD = 0.93, which rounds to 0.9.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

 Moondrop, established in 2015, is a relatively new company but has established certain market recognition primarily through IEM products. The product warranty period of one year meets industry standards, though official distributor support structure in Japan remains limited. Public long-term failure rate data is limited. Firmware update support is provided through the dedicated "Moondrop Link" app, with features including five EQ profiles. While uncertainties exist regarding support structure as an emerging manufacturer, technical product update responses are handled appropriately.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The VDSF (Virtual Diffuse Sound Field) tuning approach based on scientific evidence is rational. Driver optimization through real ear canal simulation and acoustic design based on measurement data represent a development stance that values measurement results over subjectivity. The design philosophy of improving transparency across the full range through hybrid configuration, which is difficult with single drivers, is also rational. LDAC/LC3 support to minimize quality degradation in wireless transmission represents the correct approach. However, no revolutionary solutions are presented for fundamental physical constraints in the True Wireless earphone market (sound isolation, battery life, size constraints), remaining within the scope of optimization through conventional approaches.

## Advice

The Moondrop ULTRASONIC offers a well-balanced package of features, usability, and engineering. Given proper fit and quieter environments, the hybrid design with LDAC can deliver high-quality playback.

However, TWS constraints remain: limited passive isolation and practical ANC effectiveness. Do not expect strong improvement in noisy environments, and account for fit variability.

For higher cost-performance, consider SoundPEATS Capsule3 Pro (69.99 USD) which offers similar functionality at a lower price. Choose ULTRASONIC if you prefer Moondrop’s tuning and app behavior; choose the alternative if you prioritize pure price-to-feature ratio.
