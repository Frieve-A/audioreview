## Overview

The KSC75 combines an open-back ear-clip design with **2 µm titanium-coated diaphragms** (spec: 15–25,000 Hz, 60 Ω, 101 dB, THD <0.2%). It favors situational awareness and comfort in casual listening scenarios.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent data (RTings) show **Low-Frequency Extension of 62.59 Hz** and **Low-Bass error of −9.76 dB**, evidencing insufficient sub-100 Hz output. **Weighted THD** rises with level (**0.219% @90 dB; 0.715% @100 dB**). Being open-back, passive isolation is negligible. Scoring relies primarily on this third-party data; manufacturer bandwidth is contextual only.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A conventional dynamic platform modestly enhanced by a **2 µm titanium coating**. The minimalist build is cost-effective but omits modern conveniences like detachable cabling.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Typical US street price example: **19.99 USD** (Amazon). As the cheapest equal-or-better comparator, **Moondrop Chu II** (wired IEM with credible near-target FR assessments and isolation) is **18.99 USD** in the US market; the resulting ratio supports a maximum CP score within our rubric.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Koss provides a **Limited Lifetime Warranty**. For U.S. service, the stated **handling/return shipping is 9 USD per stereophone**. The **fixed cable** is a practical weak point, and the lightweight plastic build is not intended for abuse.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Prioritizing open staging and midrange clarity over deep bass is internally consistent for the price. Material and mechanical simplicity channel cost toward audible performance rather than cosmetic features.

## Advice

Buy it for clear mids, airy presentation, and awareness of surroundings. Skip it if you need sub-bass heft, isolation, or a detachable cable. Fit and foam condition materially affect tonality—take a minute to dial in clip position.
