## Overview

The Magnetar Audio UDP900 is a reference-grade universal player supporting UHD BD, BD (incl. 3D), DVD-Video, **DVD-Audio**, **SACD**, and CD. It weighs 15.5 kg with a reinforced, compartmentalized chassis. Analog audio is a key focus: a dedicated stereo stage based on **ESS9038PRO** (balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA) and a separate multichannel stage using **ESS9028PRO** (7.1 RCA). Dual HDMI, USB-B DAC input, and support for HDR10/HDR10+/**Dolby Vision** are provided.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

APx555-based third-party measurements show the UDP900’s DAC section achieves high performance. Using USB in and RCA out (24/96), **THD+N ~0.006% at 1 kHz**, dynamic range/SNR about **122 dB (A-wtd)**; XLR SNR measured **~126 dB**. THD vs. frequency over RCA stays ~0.005% from 20 Hz–800 Hz, ~0.01% near 3 kHz, and ~0.006% at 20 kHz. On XLR, THD rises toward ~0.06% at 20 kHz; maximum outputs are ~1.95 Vrms (RCA) and ~4.6 Vrms (XLR). Headphone out delivers ~124 mW/32 Ω with ~40 Ω output impedance. These values substantiate claims of objectively strong analog performance, while flagging the high-frequency THD peculiarity on balanced outs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The UDP900 combines current ESS silicon, robust power/grounding, and heavy mechanical design to reduce interference and vibration. Capabilities span UHD HDR formats and native DSD/PCM via USB-DAC. While implementation quality is high, the approach is evolutionary rather than novel.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The **Reavon UBR-X200** is the **cheapest alternative** we could confirm that (a) plays UHD BD + **SACD/DVD-Audio**, and (b) includes **balanced stereo and 7.1 analog outputs**, with **published bench measurements**. Against the UDP900’s USD 2,999, the UBR-X200’s USD 1,699 MSRP anchors this score. Reavon’s measured analog performance is serviceable though not class-leading; the UDP900’s elevated build and analog performance justify some premium, but not enough to materially improve the ratio.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Magnetar provides a 2-year limited warranty (region-dependent). The 15.5 kg double-layer chassis, shielding partitions, and discrete analog stages are favorable for longevity. Long-term field reliability data remain limited due to the model’s relative newness.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Design choices (dual power supply strategy, shielded compartments, discrete stereo vs. multichannel DACs) directly track the measured outcomes. Emphasis on physical media and analog stages is coherent for the intended audience.

## Advice

Choose the UDP900 if you need **SACD/DVD-Audio** plus high-quality analog outs (stereo XLR/RCA and 7.1 RCA) in one chassis and value flagship build. If you mainly use HDMI audio, the cheaper UBR-X200 covers disc formats at far lower cost; for purist 2-ch analog, the UDP900’s measured advantages may be worth it.
