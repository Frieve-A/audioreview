## Overview

The Magnetar Audio UDP800 is a universal disc player targeting audiophiles seeking analog outputs for high-resolution audio playback. Priced at 1599 USD, it features dual Burr-Brown PCM1795 DACs with separate processing for left and right channels and provides both balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA stereo analog outputs. The chassis uses a double-layer construction (1.6 mm steel top structure with a 3 mm base plate), and the unit is specified at 6.8 kg. The player supports comprehensive disc formats including 4K UHD Blu-ray, SACD, DVD-Audio, and various file formats up to DSD128 and 24-bit/192 kHz PCM, positioning itself as a premium solution for both video and audio enthusiasts.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Measured performance from HomeTheaterHifi.com reveals concerning results relative to the quality of components used. THD+N measures 0.0311% at 10 kHz, which while below the problematic 0.1% threshold, represents significantly higher distortion than expected from PCM1795 specifications [1]. SNR achieves 110 dB (A-weighted), exceeding the transparent level of 105 dB and providing ~18-bit resolution capability. Frequency response remains flat to 60 kHz before rolling off -4 dB at 80 kHz. However, the reviewer noted that "distortion products and harmonic spurs are much higher than expected across the board, to the point that these artifacts would be audible in regular playback" and performance was "well off the quoted specs from the TI/Burr-Brown spec sheet." [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The UDP800 employs industry-standard components including dual PCM1795 DACs with independent channel processing and MUSES8920 operational amplifiers. The MediaTek MT8581 handles video processing and upscaling duties. Construction features a double-layer chassis with 1.6 mm steel plating and 3 mm base reinforcement, demonstrating solid mechanical engineering. However, the design represents mature rather than cutting-edge technology, utilizing established chip architectures without proprietary innovations or advanced digital signal processing capabilities that characterize modern high-performance implementations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Within the set of universal disc players that provide stereo **balanced XLR** analog outputs (and support for 4K UHD Blu-ray, SACD, and DVD-Audio), the UDP800 is currently the most affordable option at 1,599 USD. The closest alternative with equivalent or greater functionality is the Reavon UBR-X200, which adds 7.1-channel analog outputs and also includes stereo balanced XLR, but is priced at 1,699 USD or higher, keeping UDP800 as the lowest-priced choice in this specific capability class. For users who do **not** require analog outputs, lower-cost options exist (e.g., Sony UBP-X800M2 around 329.99 USD), but those do not meet the analog-output requirement and therefore are not part of this CP comparison.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Magnetar Audio represents a relatively new brand with limited market history, though the UDP800 demonstrates robust physical construction with substantial weight and reinforced chassis design indicating durability. The simple mechanical disc transport and established DAC architecture suggest inherent reliability, while the heavy construction should provide good long-term stability. However, the company's limited track record prevents assessment of long-term support capabilities, warranty service quality, and firmware update consistency compared to established manufacturers with decades of market presence.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy appropriately addresses the specific need for high-quality analog outputs in universal disc playback, particularly valuable for SACD and DVD-Audio enthusiasts requiring direct analog connections. The dual-DAC approach for stereo processing represents sound engineering practice. However, the significant gap between component specifications and measured performance suggests implementation issues that compromise the rational foundation of using premium DAC chips. The focus on analog outputs remains scientifically justified for maintaining signal purity in analog-domain processing chains, though execution falls short of theoretical potential.

## Advice

The UDP800 serves a specific market segment requiring universal disc compatibility with analog outputs, where few alternatives exist. Its comprehensive format support and substantial build quality justify consideration for users specifically needing SACD and DVD-Audio playback through analog connections. However, the measured performance discrepancies indicate that buyers seeking maximum fidelity might achieve better results with separate dedicated components, while those primarily using digital outputs would find superior value in alternatives like the Sony UBP-X800M2 (approx. 329.99 USD) with an external DAC.
