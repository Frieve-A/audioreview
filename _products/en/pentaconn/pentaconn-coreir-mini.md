## Overview

Pentaconn’s COREIR Mini is the compact variant of its metal-core eartips engineered to fit true wireless charging cases. The Mini shortens the COREIR’s metal core to ~87% of the original and, per the maker’s survey, fits about 70% of TWS models while keeping the metal-core concept and adding a colored cushion to avoid nozzle contact [1][2]. Pentaconn is the connector brand of Nippon Dics; its 4.4 mm “Pentaconn” jack was developed by Nippon Dics and conforms to JEITA RC-8141C [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Claims (resonance control and clearer mids via a stainless-steel core) are physically plausible, but we did not find rigorous third-party measurements demonstrating improvements in frequency response linearity, distortion, isolation in dB, or other controlled metrics. Current evidence is limited to manufacturer descriptions and retailer copy [1][2]. Until independent data appears, the score reflects a neutral baseline with provisional language.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design integrates a short stainless-steel core and adds a silicone cushion for nozzle protection with color identification. The TWS-focused shortening is practical engineering rather than advanced materials or novel acoustic structures. Competent but not cutting-edge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Cheapest non-inferior alternative: SpinFit CP100 (silicone eartips, broad size options, wide device fit) at 10.99 USD [4]. Review target street price: 24.99 USD [5].  
Cost-Performance = 10.99 USD ÷ 24.99 USD = **0.44** → score 0.4. Given limited verified performance gains, the price premium is hard to justify for most users.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Pentaconn/Nippon Dics is an established supplier (notably of the 4.4 mm connector). The Mini’s stainless core should be durable, and retailer-backed warranty support is typical. Direct global support varies by region.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The dimensional reduction to address charging case interference is rational for practical use. However, the lack of controlled measurements for audible improvements keeps this at the hypothesis stage, limiting the evaluation.

## Advice

If charging case interference is an issue, we recommend trying more affordable options like **SpinFit CP100** first. If you value the metal core effect, consider comparing with products that have more comprehensive measurement data.
