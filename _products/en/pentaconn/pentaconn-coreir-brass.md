## Overview

Pentaconn COREIR Brass integrates a **nickel-plated brass** core within silicone eartips. It comes in **S/MS/M/L** sizes (color-coded: S=Black, MS=Blue, M=Yellow, L=Red), **two pairs per pack**, and fits **4.5–5.5 mm** nozzles. A colored silicone cushion prevents collision between the metal core and the IEM nozzle. The maker cautions that metal parts may detach under excessive force and warns users with nickel sensitivity.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

As of today, there are **0 published third-party datasets** (FR/THD/isolation) demonstrating measurable advantages for COREIR Brass over common silicone tips. Independent research shows that **ear-tip type/fit can alter ear-canal acoustics and perceived response**, but there is **no product-specific evidence** that a brass core yields superior, repeatable results. With no quantified improvements (0 dB reported gain, 0 isolation delta reported), we adjust from the 0.5 baseline to **0.3**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Build execution (metal insert, plating, size coding) is neat, but the underlying method—embedding a standard metal insert in silicone—is only moderately sophisticated and not notably novel for the category.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

**Comparator (equal-or-better on function/fit)**  
- Pentaconn COREIR Brass: **49 USD** (JP reference 3,850円)  
- SpinFit **CP145** (2 pairs): **10.99 USD** (JP reference ≈1,375–1,530円)

**Computation (USD basis, 1-decimal rounding):** 10.99 ÷ 49.00 = **0.2**.  
Both are silicone tips for **4.5–5.5 mm** nozzles and include **2 pairs**; with no verified performance gains, the large price gap drives a poor value score.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Materials and warnings (possible metal detachment; nickel sensitivity) are clearly disclosed. Retailer warranty examples include **1-year** coverage. Durability and support look industry-average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Maintaining the “sound conduit” shape is plausible in principle (preventing bore collapse), yet **audible benefits are unmeasured**. Marketing claims around brass and “fidelity” are not substantiated by product-level data, hence a neutral score.

## Advice

If you’re optimizing value and consistency, start with **SpinFit CP145** or comparable mainstream silicone tips. Tip-dependent changes largely track **fit/seal and bore geometry**, so trialing sizes remains more impactful than paying premiums for unverified material claims.
