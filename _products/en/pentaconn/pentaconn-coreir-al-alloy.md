## Overview

The second release in Pentaconn’s COREIR line adopts an aluminum-alloy core (black-anodized) inside the sound conduit, with colored silicone cushions to avoid metal–nozzle contact and ease size ID (S/MS/M/L). Compatibility is stated for 4.5–5.5 mm nozzles, sold as two pairs per size or mixed sets. Typical US market price is 49 USD per pack. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

There are no independent measurements demonstrating audible improvements attributable to the aluminum core: no frequency-response deviation (±dB) data, THD/IMD, or controlled ABX/blind trials. Any differences would most plausibly arise from fit/seal and bore geometry rather than core material, but such effects remain unquantified for this model. Manufacturer descriptions reference spatial performance and “consistent reproduction,” yet provide no third-party verification. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design shows thoughtful implementation details—aluminum-alloy core with black anodization, CMYK-colored silicone cushions, multi-size lineup, and explicit nozzle compatibility. These are rational from a manufacturing/fit consistency standpoint, but there is no technical paper, patent disclosure, or published acoustic optimization (e.g., internal surface texturing with quantified outcomes). Net: an incremental materials approach rather than breakthrough eartip acoustics. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

US reference price for COREIR Al Alloy: **49 USD** per two-pair pack. The cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative we can identify is **SpinFit CP100+** (medical-grade silicone, multi-size, standard 4–5 mm nozzle compatibility; functionally equivalent for user-facing fit/seal, performance data likewise unpublished), at **13.49 USD**. **Calculation:** 13.49 USD ÷ 49 USD = **0.275** → **0.3**. For context, **JVC Spiral Dot++ (EP-FX10)** is 19.99–29.95 USD depending on store. (Comparator choice is provisional pending comparable third-party measurements.) [2][3][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Official materials warn the metal part may separate from silicone under strong force and note anodized aluminum for the core; beyond this, no explicit warranty terms are published by Pentaconn. Distribution exists via the official shop and reputable retailers, but there is no evidence of extended warranty or exceptional service programs. Overall: average assurance with a clear, disclosed caveat. [1][2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Structurally reinforcing the conduit to stabilize geometry is a reasonable hypothesis, and the contact-prevention cushion is practical. However, without measured outcomes (FR/isolations dB, distortion) or controlled listening, claims of “spatial expression” and “consistent reproduction” remain unsubstantiated. The philosophy is material-forward rather than measurement-driven. [1]

## Advice

If you want proven ergonomic benefits at lower cost, **SpinFit CP100+** is markedly cheaper and well-regarded for fit. If you prefer acoustic-feature designs, **JVC Spiral Dot++** offers an internally dimpled bore at a mid-tier price. Choose COREIR Al Alloy only if you specifically value a rigid, metal-cored structure and accept that audible benefits are unverified; ensure your nozzles are 4.5–5.5 mm and select the appropriate size for a reliable seal.
