summary: "2.0 desktop speakers with dual analog inputs, a front headphone jack, and AC power. No third-party measurements were found, so scientific validity is provisional. The cheapest equal-or-better model with public measurements is PreSonus Eris 3.5 (2nd Gen) at 114.99 USD; since it’s pricier than the target’s 89 USD, CP is 1.0."

## Overview

The Companion 2 Series III is a wired 2.0 desktop speaker set with two rear 3.5 mm inputs and a **front** headphone jack, powered by an AC adapter[1][2]. Size is approx. 7.5" × 3.1" × 5.9" (H×W×D), and the official page remains online with a “Sold out” status[3][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

We could not locate credible **third-party measurements** (frequency response, distortion, max SPL) for this model[3][4]. Following our rules, the score defaults to **0.5** for unknown measured performance. Official/retailer documents confirm AC power, I/O, and dimensions only[1][2][3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A mature analog 2.0 design: dual line inputs, front headphone out, AC power[1][2]. Bose markets TrueSpace DSP, but there’s no wireless or digital input and little disclosure of measurement-grade specs[4]. Technical transparency is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better)**: **PreSonus Eris 3.5 (2nd Gen, pair)** — desktop-use 2.0 speakers with published third-party measurements; official price **114.99 USD**[5][6].

**Equivalence (concise)**: User-visible functions for PC desktop are covered, and **measured** frequency-response/distortion data is publicly available for the comparator, allowing a judgment of **equal-or-better** transparency vs the unmeasured target (provisional)[5][6].

**Prices**: Target **89 USD** (Bose.com, Sold out)[4] vs comparator **114.99 USD**[5].  
Since no cheaper product with equal-or-better measured performance was found, CP is **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Bose provides documentation and a dedicated support portal[3]. Official direct sales are sold out, so warranty/returns depend on the seller. The simple analog design limits potential failure modes.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Prioritizing a compact, wired 2.0 setup is practical for desks, but the lack of transparent measurement data and minimal feature set limits the case for modern fidelity-focused users[2][4].

## Advice

The Companion 2 Series III offers a simple, compact desktop speaker solution with dual inputs and a front headphone jack. However, with no third-party measurements available and limited features compared to modern alternatives, it's difficult to recommend for users seeking verified audio quality. For desktop use with measured performance, consider the PreSonus Eris 3.5 (2nd Gen) which offers published measurements and better transparency, though at a higher price point[5][6].
