## Overview

The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (2024) are true wireless earbuds released on October 10, 2024. Priced at 26,400 JPY (approx. 179 USD), they are positioned as a more affordable option within Bose's earbud lineup. They feature Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, an IPX4 water resistance rating, and an extended battery life of 8.5 hours on a single charge, with up to 31.5 hours total with the case. The earbuds also incorporate Bose's signature Active Noise Cancellation technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The frequency response features a U-shaped tuning with emphasized bass and treble regions, which deviates from a faithful reproduction of the master source. While the ANC performance is highly effective at blocking external environmental noise, it may also color the sound. A volume-dependent EQ is implemented, which alters the frequency characteristics based on volume levels, impeding consistent acoustic reproduction. Codec support is limited to only SBC and AAC, with no support for high-quality codecs like LDAC. Detailed measurement specifications such as THD and SNR are not disclosed, making it difficult to objectively verify transparent-level sound quality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The included dynamic drivers are of a standard configuration with no particular technological advantages. Bluetooth 5.3 is the current-generation standard. While the ANC technology is at the high level Bose has cultivated over many years, it is presumably differentiated from the top-tier "QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds." The inclusion of a 5-band graphic equalizer, accessible via the app, is a commendable feature that offers users flexibility in sound tuning. The IPX4 water resistance also meets current market standards. Overall, the product shows solid engineering that balances price and performance using established technologies rather than introducing new breakthroughs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At a price of 179 USD, more affordable alternatives with equivalent or superior functionality exist. The EarFun Air Pro 3, for example, offers powerful ANC and LDAC codec support for around 60 USD, significantly outperforming this product in price-to-performance ratio. The calculation is "60 USD รท 179 USD = 0.335...", which rounds to a score of 0.3. The Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC is another strong competitor, providing LDAC and high-performance ANC for around 80 USD. Compared to these products, the Bose's price competitiveness is limited, and excluding brand premium, the objective performance-to-price ratio is inferior.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Some user reviews have reported connectivity issues, with connection instability being a point of concern, particularly in stationary situations. This is a potential flaw that could undermine the core audio experience. Bose maintains a consistent global support system, but specific warranty terms and conditions vary by region of purchase. Without detailed failure rate data for specific markets, the user reports suggest that reliability may be a concern and could fall below the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The focus on ANC technology to improve the auditory experience by reducing external noise is a scientifically rational approach. However, the U-shaped frequency response caters to general consumer preference rather than source fidelity, diverging from a scientific approach. The lack of high-quality codec support is an outdated decision for 2024's technology standards. With technologies like LDAC now widespread, supporting only SBC/AAC lacks rationality. While the inclusion of a 5-band EQ is a rational design choice for sound adjustment flexibility, it can also be seen as a supplementary function to compensate for fundamental acoustic design choices, which is not an optimal design philosophy.

## Advice

This product is for users who want Bose's powerful noise cancellation and long battery life at a relatively affordable price. However, we strongly recommend a detailed comparison with competitors before making a purchase. The EarFun Air Pro 3 (approx. 60 USD) and Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC (approx. 80 USD) in particular offer a significant advantage in cost-performance, providing high-quality codecs and excellent ANC for much less. The sound quality is tuned for entertainment over fidelity, making it unsuitable for applications requiring transparency. Reports of connectivity issues should also be considered, warranting a cautious decision.
