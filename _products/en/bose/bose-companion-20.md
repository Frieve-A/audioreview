## Overview

Launched in 2011, the Bose Companion 20 is a two-speaker desktop system featuring Bose TrueSpace stereo digital processing, active electronic equalization, and an advanced ported enclosure. Each speaker measures 21.9 × 8.9 × 11.9 cm and the system includes a wired control pod with volume/mute, headphone output, and an auxiliary input. Dimensions, included accessories, and key features are documented in Bose materials [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Bose does not publish frequency-response, THD/IMD, maximum SPL, or amplifier output specifications for the Companion 20, and the owner’s guide similarly omits audio performance data [1][2]. As of this review, we found no credible third-party laboratory measurements establishing on-axis response linearity or distortion across the mid/high band. With measured performance unknown, we set scientific validity at the neutral baseline of 0.5 and will revise if independently verified data emerges.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

TrueSpace processing, active EQ, and port tuning represent competent early-2010s solutions for widening image and extending bass from compact 2.0 speakers. However, the design lacks modern, user-visible signal processing (e.g., published DSP targets, room/desk compensation) and does not present technical disclosures (papers, curves) indicative of current best practice. Overall, average implementation for its era [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Market price for the Companion 20 is 250 USD (Bose listing) [1]. The cheapest equal-or-better alternative we identified is the **Edifier R1280T**, a powered 2.0 desktop/bookshelf pair with dual RCA inputs, user-adjustable bass/treble, and published manufacturer specs (42 W RMS, SNR ≥ 85 dB(A), frequency response 52 Hz–20 kHz) [3]. This satisfies equivalence from a user perspective (same 2.0 function set; published performance envelope at least as comprehensive). As of August 2025, the R1280T’s representative new price in the US is **113.99 USD** [4].  
**CP calculation:** 113.99 USD ÷ 250 USD = 0.456 → **0.5** (first-decimal rounding).  
(For Japan readers: typical domestic R1280T new price ≈ 17,080 円; shown here for context only [5].)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Bose maintains global support and documentation access, and the current US limited warranty for consumer products is **1 year** (region-dependent) [2][6]. While the infrastructure is established, the short standard warranty period and lack of firmware/service considerations (category-appropriate) justify a slightly-above-average score rather than high.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Pursuing “big sound” from a compact 2.0 form via proprietary processing and port loading is a rational target, but withholding core performance data prevents users from validating claims or optimizing placement with objective references. The absence of user-adjustable tonal controls on the speaker itself also reduces adaptability compared with peers that publish specs and offer basic EQ [1][3].

## Advice

Choose the Companion 20 if you want a tidy, sub-less 2.0 desktop setup with a convenient control pod and are comfortable with brand-tuned processing without published performance curves. If you prioritize measurement-visible neutrality or adjustability, consider alternatives that disclose key specs and provide tone controls—e.g., Edifier R1280T—so you can target a flatter response at the desk [3][4][5].
