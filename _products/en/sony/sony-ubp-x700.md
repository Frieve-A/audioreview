## Overview

Sony’s UBP-X700 is a compact 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player introduced in **2018** with support for UHD BD, BD, DVD, CD, and **SACD**, plus Dolby Vision/HDR10 and essential streaming apps. It offers **two HDMI outputs** (one audio-only) and a **coaxial S/PDIF** output, making it a flexible digital transport for AVRs and TVs. Key dimensions are **W320 × H45 × D217 mm**, weight **~1.4 kg**. [1][5][7]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a digital transport, the X700 outputs audio/video **bitstream over HDMI** (Dolby Atmos/DTS:X pass-through; **DSD over HDMI** for SACD). There is no analog audio stage to measure. While no third-party lab has published comprehensive error-rate or jitter datasets for this model, long-term user and reviewer experience indicates correct format handling without dropouts under normal use. Firmware **M43.R.0292** remains available, reflecting sustained support. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

UHD BD with **Dolby Vision/HDR10**, **dual HDMI** (including audio-only), **SACD**, Ethernet/Wi-Fi apps, and standard bitstream of immersive codecs deliver a complete feature set for the price. Omissions versus premium tiers include HDR10+ and any analog/multichannel analog outs or heavy chassis/bracing. [1][5]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Street price verified at **259 USD** (UBP-X700/M). The **cheapest equal-or-better alternative** we can confirm is **Sony UBP-X800M2** at **329.99 USD**; it matches the core criteria (UHD BD **+ Dolby Vision + SACD + dual-HDMI**) and adds a heavier chassis. Since no cheaper model meets or exceeds these capabilities, CP is **1.0**. [3][4][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sony provides a standard **1-year limited warranty** in the U.S. and maintains firmware **M43.R.0292** (posted **May 30, 2022**). The light chassis is not “tank-like,” but field reliability is typical for the class. [2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sony prioritizes disc format breadth and practical connectivity over boutique analog design. The dual-HDMI architecture acknowledges real-world AVR/TV chains; SACD support is a welcome inclusion for collectors. Absent are high-mass construction and audiophile analog stages—appropriate given the X700’s transport-centric role. [1]

## Advice

If you value sturdier build, quieter transport, or Bluetooth transmitter, **UBP-X800M2** is the straightforward step-up. If SACD is irrelevant, cheaper players exist—but they typically drop Dolby Vision or dual-HDMI, changing the value calculus.
