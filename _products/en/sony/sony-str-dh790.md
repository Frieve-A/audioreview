## Overview

The Sony STR-DH790 is a 7.2-channel AV receiver for entry-level home theater systems. Introduced in 2018, it supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, has four HDMI inputs (4K/60p with HDR10/HLG/Dolby Vision pass-through), one HDMI output with eARC/ARC, Bluetooth audio reception (SBC/AAC), and Sony’s Digital Cinema Auto Calibration (DCAC). Compact 5.25-inch height makes it easy to rack, and it targets users who do not need network streaming or advanced room correction [1][2][3][4][5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Key **manufacturer specs** under stated test conditions: 90 W per channel into 6 Ω, 20 Hz–20 kHz, 0.09% THD, with 2 channels driven; and a reference figure of 145 W per channel at 6 Ω, 1 kHz, 0.9% THD, 1 channel driven [2][3][5]. The 0.09% THD is below the 0.1% “problematic” threshold, but above the 0.01% “transparent” target for electronics. Supported formats include Dolby Atmos/DTS:X and DSD 2.8 MHz up to 5.1 channels via HDMI (manufacturer) [4][5]. Comprehensive third-party bench data (S/N, crosstalk, multichannel SINAD) remains limited; conclusions are therefore primarily based on manufacturer documentation and reputable retailer spec summaries [2][4][5].

**Connectivity specifics:** 4 in/1 out HDMI 2.0a, HDR10/HLG/Dolby Vision pass-through, eARC/ARC on the HDMI out, dual sub pre-outs, 1 optical + 1 coaxial digital in, 4 analog inputs. Front L/R use binding posts; other channels use spring-clip terminals [1][4][5].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Solid but conventional platform: HDMI 2.0a (no HDMI 2.1/8K features), DCAC rather than advanced multi-point correction, and Bluetooth receiver without Wi-Fi/streaming stack. Support for modern HDR formats and eARC is appropriate for current TVs, yet the architecture is clearly last-gen compared with 8K/4K120-capable peers [1][4][5].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Current market price (review target): 498 USD** (major US retailer, in stock) [5].  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator found:** Onkyo TX-NR5100 — 7.2 ch, Dolby Atmos/DTS:X, HDMI 2.1 with 8K/4K120, network streaming (AirPlay 2/Chromecast), **649.99 USD** (major US retailer) [6]. From the user’s perspective it is **equal-or-better** in core functions (7.2 channels, Atmos/DTS:X) and adds next-gen HDMI and streaming; however it is **more expensive** than the Sony. No cheaper product with equal-or-better user-visible functionality and published performance was identified at the time of verification, so **CP = MIN(1.0, 649.99 ÷ 498) = 1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Mainstream design with simple thermal/feature load and few moving parts suggests typical reliability for the class. Practical notes: spring-clip terminals on non-front channels can be less durable than posts; retailer lists a 2-year warranty for this model and provides broad support [5].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product delivers necessary multichannel amplification and decoding without boutique claims. Choices like eARC, dual-sub outs, and DCAC address real use cases. Cost-driven terminal selection (spring clips for surrounds/backs) and omission of HDMI 2.1 keep price low but limit future-proofing [1][4][5].

## Advice

A strong entry point for a 5.1.2 or 7.1 setup when you value Atmos/DTS:X, eARC, and straightforward operation over gaming-centric HDMI 2.1 features or network streaming. If you need 8K/4K120 and built-in streaming, budget for models like Onkyo TX-NR5100 or Denon’s current S-series.
