## Overview

The Sony LSPX-S3 is a Bluetooth speaker that achieves 360-degree sound by vibrating an organic glass tube. With a cylindrical design measuring 94mm in diameter, 289mm in height, and weighing 0.93kg, it features a 32-level adjustable LED light providing candle-like ambiance effects. Combining a 46mm diameter woofer with an organic glass tube tweeter, the Advanced Vertical Drive Technology drives the glass tube through three actuators at its edges. It offers 8-hour battery life and LDAC-compatible Bluetooth connectivity, priced at approximately 330 USD in the market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Objective measurements by DXOMARK confirm that this product's acoustic performance significantly falls below industry standards. An unusual resonant boost at around 16kHz is detected, disappearing at higher volumes and causing treble instability. The frequency response suffers from fundamental issues including high-frequency inconsistency, mid-range ambiguity, and insufficient low-frequency depth, failing to achieve flat characteristics within ±3dB. THD+N shows peaks in low-mid ranges, exceeding 1% problem levels overall. These measurement results significantly deviate from the standards for achieving transparent-level sound quality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the approach of using an organic glass tube as a vibrating element shows originality, it does not contribute to actual acoustic performance improvement. The three-point drive system using Advanced Vertical Drive Technology can be evaluated as an engineering effort, but questions arise about its technical effectiveness when the final measured results are inferior to conventional electromagnetic driver systems. LDAC support and Bluetooth connectivity functions remain at standard implementation levels, failing to establish proprietary technologies that directly contribute to sound quality improvement. The physical constraints of glass tube vibration result in performance indicators below what conventional speaker designs can achieve.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Against the 330 USD price point, the Tribit StormBox (approximately 65 USD) available on Amazon provides equivalent or superior 360-degree acoustics and Bluetooth functionality. This Tribit model achieves 24W output, 20-hour battery life, and IPX7 waterproof performance, surpassing it functionally. Calculation: 65 USD ÷ 330 USD ≈ 0.197, evaluating the LSPX-S3's cost-performance at 0.2. Even considering the LED lighting function, other competing products in the same price range provide significantly superior performance in terms of sound quality, failing to deliver value commensurate with the price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sony's warranty system and support quality as a brand meet industry standards, providing a nationwide service network and appropriate warranty periods. However, concerns arise regarding vulnerability to drops and impacts due to the glass structure product characteristics. Compared to conventional plastic housing speakers, careful handling is required, with limitations in terms of physical durability. Firmware update support and app integration functions are properly implemented, ensuring functional reliability for long-term use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The unique approach of acoustic reproduction through glass tube vibration ultimately results in deteriorated measured performance, lacking scientific rationality. The design approach requires fundamental reconsideration as it achieves results below the sound quality levels easily attainable with conventional electromagnetic drivers using complex mechanisms. The concept of fusion with LED lighting emphasizes decorative aspects but diverges from the direction of sound quality improvement that audio products should inherently pursue. Including the pricing strategy, the rationality of the product strategy is questionable given the current situation where numerous cheaper and higher-performance alternatives exist.

## Advice

When considering purchasing the LSPX-S3, we strongly recommend comparing it with alternatives available in the same price range. For 360-degree acoustics needs, the Tribit StormBox available on Amazon provides 24W output, 20-hour battery life, and IPX7 waterproof performance at approximately one-fifth the price. For higher sound quality requirements, other products in the same price range demonstrate significantly superior results in terms of measured performance. Even if you find special value in the LED lighting function, combining a sound quality-focused product with separate lighting equipment would likely result in higher overall satisfaction. For those prioritizing basic performance as an audio product, we recommend considering more rational alternatives.
