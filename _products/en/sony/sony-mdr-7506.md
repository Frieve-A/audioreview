## Overview

The Sony MDR-7506 is a closed-back studio headphone that has been widely used as an industry standard since its release in 1991. It features 40mm drivers with neodymium magnets and claims a frequency response of 10Hz-20kHz. The lightweight 227g foldable design includes a protective pouch. For over 30 years, it has been continuously used in broadcasting stations, recording studios, and audio production facilities, with unmatched market penetration and recognition in the industry.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

According to the measurement results standards table, this product shows problematic levels across multiple indicators. The frequency response has a significant peak above 5kHz, compromising the original sound balance. This is a major deviation from the transparent level of 20Hz-20kHz Â±0.5dB. Particularly problematic is the harmonic distortion, with high THD values in the low frequencies, approaching the problematic level for headphones (0.5%). Channel matching also shows inconsistencies below 300Hz. When compared with modern digital technology, the audible sound quality improvement is limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Based on 1991 design technology, it falls below the industry average by current technical standards. The combination of 40mm drivers and neodymium magnets was standard for its time but offers no special technical advantages today. Design originality and rationality are limited, resembling a configuration of off-the-shelf components. No technological innovations contributing to measurement performance improvements are evident, and with the basic design unchanged for over 30 years, its contribution to technological progress is evaluated as low.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The calculated score is 1.0, as no alternative product that is both cheaper and demonstrably superior in all measurement aspects has been identified. However, this score does not imply a recommendation. The Audio-Technica ATH-M40x, which surpasses this model in measurement performance, is available for approximately 99 USD, nearly the same price. Since a superior product can be purchased for the same price, the economic rationale for choosing the MDR-7506 (99.99 USD) is lost. While it is among the cheapest in its class by price alone, it is not competitive in terms of performance for the price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

With over 30 years of manufacturing history and global adoption, its reliability is at an industry-leading level. Sony's global support system provides excellent repair service with a stable supply of parts. Failure rates are low, with durability suitable for long-term professional use. The warranty period is standard, and the industry's repair system infrastructure is highly rated. However, since firmware updates and other modern features are not applicable, no additional points are awarded in this category.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

With little change from its 1991 design philosophy, it lacks rationality from the perspective of modern scientific sound quality improvement. Even in new models, no improvements are seen in harmonic distortion and frequency response, which remain at problematic levels, indicating an insufficient commitment to technological progress. Adhering to an outdated design approach without technical improvements, despite the emergence of higher-performance products at the same price, is irrational. While there are no claims of unmeasurable effects, there is also no active pursuit of measurable performance improvements.

## Advice

Purchasing the MDR-7506 is not recommended, except for cases where compatibility with an existing environment is the top priority. While it is well-known as an industry standard, its measurement performance is clearly outdated by modern standards. Critically, the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x, which offers superior frequency response and lower distortion, is available for almost the same price. Therefore, there is virtually no advantage in choosing this model for a new setup. If you prioritize objective performance and value over brand recognition and convention, we strongly recommend choosing the ATH-M40x or higher-tier alternatives like the AKG K371.
