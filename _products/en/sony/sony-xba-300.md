summary: "A discontinued in-ear headphone with a triple balanced armature setup. While it boasts a wide frequency range of 5Hz-40kHz, its 2015 technology is now commonplace. As a used product priced around 10,000 JPY, its cost-performance is extremely low compared to current models like the KZ ZSN Pro 2 (approx. 3,000 JPY), which offer comparable or better performance."

## Overview

The Sony XBA-300 is a triple balanced armature in-ear headphone released by Sony in 2015. It employs a Symmetric Armature Direct Drive structure with three drivers (full-range, woofer, and HD super tweeter) to achieve a 5Hz-40kHz wide-band reproduction. The product features a magnesium alloy rigid mount housing and a brass sound path to suppress resonance, claiming Hi-Res audio compatibility. The design incorporates a 4-wire ground separate cable with silver-plated OFC litz wire to reduce interference between left and right channels.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The nominal frequency response of 5Hz-40kHz significantly exceeds the human audible range of 20Hz-20kHz. However, without comprehensive third-party measurement data for metrics like THD+N and IMD within the audible range, the scientific validity of its fidelity cannot be fully verified. The wide frequency range itself does not guarantee superior performance within the audible spectrum. The low impedance of 16ฮฉ and high sensitivity of 101dB/mW allow for easy driving from smartphones. While the triple BA configuration theoretically offers low distortion, the lack of objective data limits the evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While the combination of a triple balanced armature configuration and a magnesium alloy housing was advanced for 2015, these technologies are now standard in the industry. Technical elements like the armature structure, brass sound path, and silver-plated OFC cable are no longer considered cutting-edge. From a current technological standpoint, the product's implementation is average, and it holds no significant advantage over modern multi-driver designs and acoustic technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

With production discontinued, the XBA-300 is only available on the used market for around 10,000 JPY, making its cost-performance very poor. A current product like the KZ ZSN Pro 2 (approx. 3,000 JPY) offers comparable or superior performance with a 1BA+1DD hybrid configuration, featuring a 20Hz-40kHz frequency response, 108dB sensitivity, and a detachable cable. Despite different internal structures, the user-facing functionality and performance are equivalent or better. The CP is calculated as 3,000 JPY รท 10,000 JPY = 0.3. Considering the risks associated with used products, the availability of a superior new product at less than a third of the price cannot be ignored.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While the Sony brand and magnesium housing suggest basic build quality, the product's reliability is very low. As it is discontinued, there is no official support, warranty, or parts supply. Balanced armature drivers are sensitive to physical shock, and the risk of failure in a used product is significant. The lack of any manufacturer support makes it a far less reliable choice compared to any currently produced product.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy, which pursued extended frequency characteristics, frequency division via a triple BA setup, a lightweight and high-rigidity housing, and reduced transmission loss, is based on rational principles for improving sound quality. However, while the approach is scientifically sound, the final product can now be easily matched or surpassed by far more cost-effective modern technologies and manufacturing processes. The adherence to a high-cost component structure is less rational from today's perspective, where similar performance is achievable at a fraction of the cost.

## Advice

While this product was built on a solid design philosophy and technical implementation for its time, it is now obsolete and constrained to the used market. For its current used price of approximately 10,000 JPY, you can achieve superior sound quality and reliability with a new product like the KZ ZSN Pro 2 for about 3,000 JPY. The XBA-300 holds little practical value today. For those interested in Sony's latest audio technology, we strongly recommend choosing current, supported products such as the WF-1000XM5 (approx. 33,000 JPY) or the MDR-MV1 (approx. 54,000 JPY). Purchase is not recommended, except for collection or historical purposes.
