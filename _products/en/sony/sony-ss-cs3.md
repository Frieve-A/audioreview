## Overview

The Sony SS-CS3 is a 3-way floor-standing speaker in Sony’s Core Series. It uses dual 5-inch woofers, a 1-inch tweeter, and a 0.75-inch super-tweeter in a bass-reflex cabinet. Catalog specs list 45 Hz–50 kHz, 6-ohm nominal impedance, and 88 dB sensitivity (2.83 V/1 m). It is sold **individually** (one speaker per box).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Independent Klippel NFS (CTA-2034) data reports **numerous midrange resonances** that are broad and varied in Q, which **typical AVR auto-EQ cannot remedy**. The audible result is a hollow/boomy midband that dominates the in-room balance despite otherwise decent upper-mid/treble behavior. Basic driveability is fine (6 ohms, ~88 dB sensitivity), but these midband issues materially limit fidelity. [1][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A 3-way layout plus super-tweeter is uncommon at this price and shows solid intent (wide HF extension, some directivity shaping). Implementation remains conventional (passive crossover, standard cone materials), and measured behavior indicates the design does not fully translate into clean acoustics. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Target price (denominator):** **459.98 USD per pair** (229.99 USD each; representative U.S. retail). [2][6]  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **ELAC Debut 2.0 B5.2** **pair at 269 USD** (widely listed current street). It offers smoother directivity and avoids the SS-CS3’s dense midrange resonances; key functions are equivalent for a stereo L/R pair. [4][5]  
**CP calculation:** **269 ÷ 459.98 = 0.585 → 0.6** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sony’s broad distribution and straightforward passive design make ownership low-risk. No widespread reliability faults are documented; standard warranty and parts availability are typical for the category.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product makes no non-scientific claims and follows ordinary loudspeaker engineering (measured-data-oriented presentation, conventional materials, passive network). Some feature choices (e.g., super-tweeter to 50 kHz) are arguably ancillary to audible performance, but overall direction is **generally rational** and average for the segment.

## Advice

If you specifically want towers at this budget, audition first and plan on **manual, targeted EQ** (e.g., parametric filters) and careful placement—expect added cost/complexity. For most buyers, a **competent bookshelf pair plus a subwoofer** will measure and integrate better at similar or lower system cost. [1][4]
