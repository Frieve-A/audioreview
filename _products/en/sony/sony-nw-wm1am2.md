## Overview

The Sony NW-WM1AM2 is positioned as the latest flagship model in Sony's Walkman series, serving as an Android-based digital audio player. It features a 5-inch HD touchscreen and achieves multifunctionality beyond traditional DAPs through the adoption of Android 11 OS. The device incorporates an S-Master HX digital amplifier and supports PCM playback up to 384kHz/32bit and DSD playback up to 11.2MHz. The 4.4mm balanced output delivers up to 250mW of power, and wireless playback is possible via Bluetooth 5.0 with LDAC codec support. While large-capacity music storage is enabled through 128GB internal storage and microSD card compatibility, the current market price of 1,030 USD requires careful consideration when compared to other options that provide equivalent functionality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sony publishes frequency response specifications of 20Hz-40kHz, but detailed measurement data such as THD+N and SINAD are not disclosed. Third-party measurements (Audio Science Review) show SINAD around 110dB and THD+N around 0.0005%, confirming reduction in distortion and noise via S-Master HX digital amplifier technology. As an Android-based DAP, it reaches transparent levels (SINAD over 105dB, THD+N below 0.01%), but some metrics lack detailed verification. LDAC codec wireless playback can be evaluated as a scientifically meaningful improvement, but overall assessment is slightly above average due to measurement data completeness.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption of proprietary S-Master HX digital amplifier technology and high-capacity polymer capacitors holds technical value as Sony-specific design elements. The implementation of Android 11 and WiFi support achieves multifunctionality that represents significant evolution from traditional music-dedicated DAPs. The degree of technical investment, including DSEE Ultimate AI audio processing and DSD remastering engine, exceeds industry averages. The combination of a 5-inch large display and high-rigidity aluminum body also shows design ingenuity. However, many of these technologies are increasingly adopted by other companies, making their innovation limited. The evaluation reaches a level somewhat above industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against the NW-WM1AM2's current price of 1,030 USD, equivalent functionality can be provided by a smartphone plus high-performance DAC/amplifier combination such as the Questyle M15 (approximately 134 USD) plus Android device (approximately 200 USD) for a total of about 334 USD. Calculation: 334 USD ÷ 1,030 USD = 0.32, resulting in a cost-performance evaluation of 0.3. This combination provides equivalent streaming functionality, DSD playback support, and hi-res audio support based on Android OS, with high-quality audio output (SINAD around 120dB) achieved through the M15's 4.4mm balanced output. When comparing within Android DAPs, the FiiO M23 (836 USD, Android 10 equipped) also exists, but considering the price difference, the advantages of dedicated DAP design are limited.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sony has an established support system as a global electronics manufacturer. The long history and track record of the Walkman series means product reliability significantly exceeds industry averages. In addition to a one-year manufacturer warranty, a global repair and support network is also established. Android OS update support and firmware updates can be expected, providing peace of mind for long-term use. Stability typical of major manufacturers is provided in terms of parts supply and compatibility. However, compared to DAP-specialized manufacturers, there are some aspects where audio-focused community support is slightly inferior.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The direction of Android-based DAPs has rational aspects as evolution from traditional music playback-dedicated devices. WiFi support and streaming service compatibility align with modern music listening styles. The approach of trying to balance large displays with multifunctionality is understandable. However, given the current situation where equivalent functionality can be achieved at significantly lower cost by competing products, the rationality of commercializing at this price point is questionable. The fact that the raison d'être of dedicated audio equipment can be replaced by smartphone plus high-performance DAC dongle combinations (total cost under 334 USD) also undermines the rationality of the design philosophy. The necessity of dedicated design is low given thin superiority in measured performance.

## Advice

Those considering purchasing the NW-WM1AM2 are recommended to first conduct detailed comparisons with other options that provide equivalent functionality. Particularly, if you already own an Android smartphone, combining it with high-performance DAC/amplifiers like the Questyle M15 (approximately 134 USD) or FiiO BTR7 (approximately 200 USD) can achieve equivalent sound quality (transparent level measured performance) and functionality for a total cost of around 334 USD. When comparing within Android DAPs, the price difference with the FiiO M23 (836 USD, Android 10 equipped) should also be considered. Unless you find special value in the 40-hour long battery life, 128GB large-capacity storage, and convenience as a dedicated device, or have strong preferences for the Sony brand or specific design, those prioritizing pure sound quality and cost-performance may find higher satisfaction with more affordable alternatives. We recommend carefully judging whether there are objective performance differences that justify the price difference. Reconfirm the rationality of smartphone alternatives based on measured data.
