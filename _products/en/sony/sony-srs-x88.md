## Overview

The Sony SRS-X88 is a premium 90W Bluetooth speaker released in 2015. It features five drivers (two 20mm super tweeters, two 40mm full-range drivers, and one 69mm subwoofer) with S-Master HX digital amplification, supporting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and USB connectivity. The speaker supports the LDAC codec and Hi-Res Audio (192kHz/24bit, DSD compatible) with multi-room functionality. While advanced for its time, the product has been discontinued.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

There are significant problems with its THD performance. According to official specifications, the THD is listed as 10% at the rated maximum output under JEITA standards. This figure vastly exceeds the problematic level (over 1% for speakers) in our measurement result standard table. A THD value of 10% is extremely poor compared to modern transparent levels (0.01% or lower). While the frequency response is listed as 50Hz-40,000Hz, deviation details are unknown, and important indicators like SNR and crosstalk are unpublished. The audible sound quality improvement is judged to be limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of the S-Master HX digital amplifier and LDAC codec is technically commendable. Its five-driver configuration with a passive radiator acoustic design and multi-room functionality were advanced for 2015. LDAC is Sony's proprietary technology enabling high-bitrate transmission up to 990kbps, representing a significant technical contribution to the industry. However, when evaluated by 2025 technical standards, its digital amplifier technology and wireless connectivity functions are now considered standard. While its design originality is recognized, many products with equivalent functionality now exist.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Against its original price of 399USD, the Edifier D32 (199.99USD) offers equivalent functionality. The D32 features 60W RMS output, LDAC support, Wi-Fi multi-room functionality, and Hi-Res Audio support, achieving the SRS-X88's main features at a lower cost. In terms of output, the practical difference between the SRS-X88's 90W (rated maximum output) and the D32's 60W (RMS value) is limited, considering the different measurement methods. Calculation: 199.99USD รท 399USD = 0.501, which rounds to 0.5. However, since the SRS-X88 is currently discontinued, it is only available on the used market, where prices can fluctuate significantly. The existence of alternatives that offer equivalent or superior functionality and performance at a lower cost leads to a below-average cost-performance evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While basic quality is expected from the Sony brand, this is a 2015 product that is currently discontinued. Official support is limited, with no expectation for continuous support like firmware updates. Acquisition is mainly through the used market, making it difficult to utilize warranty periods and repair services. Compared to the industry average, its current reliability and support structure is significantly inferior. Considering the difficulty of acquiring a new unit, the post-purchase support risk is judged to be high.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Hi-Res Audio support and LDAC codec development represent rational approaches that scientifically contribute to sound quality improvement. The adoption of digital amplifier technology, convenience improvements through multi-room functionality, and the provision of multiple connectivity options all contribute to enhancing auditory transparency and the user experience. The design philosophy, which actively utilized digital signal processing and broke away from the analog-centered designs of the time, was extremely advanced and rational. In particular, LDAC technology became an industry standard adopted by other manufacturers, earning high evaluation as a scientifically-grounded technological innovation. The design direction represents an ideal approach toward achieving transparent-level sound quality.

## Advice

While the SRS-X88 was an innovative product for 2015, careful judgment is needed when considering a purchase today. The biggest problem is its poor THD performance; a 10% value is unacceptable by modern standards. Additionally, being discontinued means it is only available as a used product, which comes with high support risks. We strongly recommend current products like the Edifier D32 (199.99USD), which achieve equivalent functionality with better performance. The D32, with its 60W RMS output, LDAC support, Wi-Fi multi-room functionality, and Hi-Res support, is a more rational choice. While the SRS-X88's LDAC technology was a wonderful innovation, its benefits can now be enjoyed in many products, eliminating the need to choose an older model. If sound quality is a priority, you should select a product that meets modern measurement standards.
