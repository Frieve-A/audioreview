## Overview

The Sony MDR-EX1000 is Sony's flagship in-ear monitor released in 2011. It gained attention as a premium model featuring a large 16mm dynamic driver, liquid crystal polymer (LCP) diaphragm, and magnesium housing. Currently discontinued, it trades in the used market for 11,500 to 28,130 yen depending on condition, with an average market price of approximately 18,800 yen. While it maintains certain support among audiophiles, it presents numerous problems from a scientific acoustic performance perspective.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Measurement data shows frequency response covering a wide range of 3Hz-30,000Hz, but serious audio quality degradation factors exist. The most severe issue is a sharp +6dB peak at 5.5kHz (Q=8), which generates significant harshness in cymbal reproduction. Additional peaks are confirmed around 9kHz, exhibiting a V-shaped frequency characteristic. Harmonic distortion is kept low at under 1%, with standard specifications of 32Ω impedance and 108dB/mW sensitivity. However, sharp roll-off above 12kHz results in lack of air. The scientifically audible 5.5kHz peak is clearly an audio quality degradation factor, far from achieving transparent-level sound quality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The 16mm large-diameter dynamic driver boasts one of the largest sizes for IEMs. The liquid crystal polymer diaphragm has high rigidity and internal loss, which Sony considers the best material for diaphragms. Neodymium magnets (440kJ/m³) and "lateral magnetic field press manufacturing method" enhance magnetic force. Material selection including magnesium housing and 7N-OFC Litz cable is advanced. Manufacturing processes show attention to detail, including manual acoustic material adjustment. The technical approach belongs to the advanced class in the industry, but the resulting acoustic characteristics problems indicate challenges in effective utilization of technical capabilities.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Against the used market average price of approximately 18,800 yen, TRUTHEAR x Crinacle ZERO: RED offering equal or superior sound quality is available for 8,165 yen (55 USD converted at current exchange rate). Cost-performance calculation: 8,165 yen ÷ 18,800 yen = 0.43, resulting in moderate-low evaluation. The ZERO: RED uses dual dynamic drivers (10mm + 7.8mm) compared to MDR-EX1000's single 16mm driver, but achieves excellent frequency response without the 5.5kHz peak, providing superior user experience. While internal configurations differ, user-perceived sound quality superiority is more important than driver topology differences in modern IEM evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Official support has essentially ended due to discontinuation. While cable replacement is possible due to detachable design when cables break, repair support for main unit failures cannot be expected. With distribution mainly through the used market, risks of individual variations and aging degradation exist. While Sony's brand reliability is high, without current support systems, purchase depends largely on product condition at time of acquisition.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The approach of adopting large drivers and advanced materials is theoretically rational, but the 5.5kHz peak appearing in actual frequency response is clearly a design problem. This is attributed to driver resonance caused by off-axis driver placement, a problem commonly seen in Sony's IEM products. Even within the physically constrained IEM category, better frequency response is achievable using modern design methods and measurement techniques, making this product's design philosophy largely irrational. Development policy appears to prioritize technical novelty over scientifically-based sound quality improvement.

## Advice

From a scientific sound quality perspective, purchasing this product is not recommended. Audio quality degradation from the measured +6dB (Q=8) 5.5kHz peak is clear, and the sound quality-to-price ratio is insufficient even at current used market average of 18,800 yen. As an alternative, TRUTHEAR x Crinacle ZERO: RED achieves superior frequency response at 8,165 yen (55 USD). User-perceived sound quality superiority is more important than driver topology differences (dual DD vs single 16mm DD). For current owners, sound quality improvement is possible through equalizer adjustment of -6dB attenuation in the 5.5kHz band (Q=8). Except for those valuing collection worth as audiophile items or ownership significance in Sony's technical history, strong recommendation is made for transition to modern alternative products.
