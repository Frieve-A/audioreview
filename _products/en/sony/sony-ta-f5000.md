## Overview

The Sony TA-F5000 is a compact integrated amplifier (1995, Japan-market 100 V) positioned below ES. It uses MOS-FET output devices, a toroidal power transformer, separate supplies for pre/power, and includes MM/MC phono with a discrete EQ plus an MC head-amp. Original price was ¥120,000. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Key manufacturer specs: rated 35 W+35 W (RMS, 8 Ω, 20 Hz–20 kHz), 45 W+45 W (DIN, 4 Ω); THD 0.008 % at 10 W/8 Ω; damping factor 150; line S/N 100 dB; phono S/N 85 dB (MM) / 75 dB (MC); line FR 7 Hz–100 kHz; phono FR 20 Hz–20 kHz ±3 dB. These figures suggest near-transparent power/line performance at moderate levels, but phono noise—especially MC—falls short of modern benchmarks. No credible third-party lab data exists for this model; evaluation is based on official specs cross-checked with period documentation. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The TA-F5000 reflects careful mid-’90s analog design: MOS-FET driver/output stages, relay-isolated input switching (Takamisawa), and a toroidal supply with STD split rails. Construction uses steel/aluminum bracing, short signal paths, and decent parts selection. However, there is no DSP/digital integration, and the circuit approaches are mature by today’s standards with limited technology spillover value. [2][3][4]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Review target price:** 596 USD (current used listing).  
**Cheapest equal-or-better alternative (bundle):** SMSL AO200 MKII power amplifier 249 USD + iFi ZEN Phono 3 MM/MC stage 249 USD = **498 USD**.  
**Equivalence note:** Provides at least equal user functions (line inputs + MM/MC phono) with superior measured performance (AO200 MKII THD+N ≈0.004 %; ZEN Phono 3 SNR up to 91 dB MM, balanced output, selectable loading). Therefore **498 ÷ 596 = 0.835 → score 0.8** (rounded to one decimal). [5][6][7][8]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At ~30 years old, there is no warranty or factory service; parts aging (electrolytics, relays, regulators) is expected. Field reports document thermal stress around the negative regulator causing intermittent protection trips; 100 V-only mains further complicate global use (requires quality step-down). Support is third-party/DIY only. [4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product embodies a competent analog-only approach with some rational noise/crosstalk mitigation, but little that advances audible transparency beyond contemporary practice. Compared with modern designs emphasizing ultra-low distortion, high dynamic range, and integrated functionality, the design priority skews toward build aesthetics and period conventions rather than measurable, user-audible improvements. [2][3]

## Advice

Buy for collection or a period-correct compact system where looks and tactile operation matter. For transparent, low-noise playback (especially with MC cartridges), a modern small amp + external MM/MC phono will be cheaper and objectively better. If you choose the TA-F5000, budget for refurbishment (caps, relay cleaning/replacement, regulator rework) and use a high-quality step-down transformer. [4][5][6][7]
