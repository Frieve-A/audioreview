## Overview
Sony’s WI-OE610 (“Float Run”) are open-ear sports headphones whose drivers sit off-ear to keep ambient sound audible. The concept targets runners who care more about awareness and comfort than isolation or bass impact.

## Scientific Validity
$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Independent measurements show severe low-end loss: **Low-Frequency Extension = 148.86 Hz**, **Low-bass −33.5 dB**, **Mid-bass −15.44 dB**; passive **isolation overall attenuation = −0.15 dB**; **overall leakage @1 ft = 45.47 dB**; **Weighted Harmonic Distortion = 0.852 @100 dB / 1.158 @90 dB**. Test settings note **Bluetooth 5.0** using **SBC, 16-bit/44.1 kHz**. These figures objectively justify a low score for fidelity. [1]

## Technology Level
$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Standard **16 mm dynamic drivers** in an off-ear mount, **IPX4** splash resistance, and **Bluetooth 5.0 with SBC/AAC** constitute mainstream tech without novel processing or codec support (no LDAC/aptX). [2][3]

## Cost-Performance
$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Price (denominator): 129.99 USD.**  
**Cheapest non-inferior alternative (numerator): Soundcore AeroFit (open-ear, IPX7), widely available at 99.99 USD.**  
**CP = 99.99 USD ÷ 129.99 USD ≈ 0.77 → score 0.8.**  
*Equivalence note:* AeroFit serves the same open-ear use with **equal or better water resistance (IPX7 vs IPX4)**; no clearly inferior user-facing functions identified. [4][5]

## Reliability & Support
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sony offers a **1-year limited warranty (US/Canada)**; simple neckband/driver structure plus IPX4 suggests average durability for light outdoor exercise. Model-specific failure rates are not published. [6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy
$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Keeping ears open is rational for safety. However, measured **bass deficiency and near-zero isolation** substantially limit music fidelity. For awareness-first workouts, the trade-off is acceptable; for music-first listening, it isn’t.

## Advice
Choose WI-OE610 if situational awareness is paramount. If you want similar awareness with better protection and price, **Soundcore AeroFit** is stronger value. If isolation is acceptable, conventional in-ear/over-ear models deliver far more accurate frequency response.
