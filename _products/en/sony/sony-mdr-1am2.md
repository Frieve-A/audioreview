## Overview

The Sony MDR-1AM2 is a Hi-Res Audio certified closed-back headphone released in 2018. It features 40mm ALCP (Aluminum Coated Liquid Crystal Polymer) diaphragms, achieving a nominal wide frequency response of 3Hz-100kHz. Characterized by a lightweight design of 187g and a comfortable fit, it includes both a standard 3.5mm cable and a 4.4mm balanced cable. As part of Sony's Hi-Res Audio product lineup, it adopts a consumer-oriented V-shaped sound signature.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

According to detailed third-party measurement data, this headphone's frequency response exhibits a typical V-shape with multiple peaks in the bass and treble regions. This is an intentional tuning and differs from scientific fidelity to the source (a flat response). The total harmonic distortion is kept low across the frequency spectrum, suggesting a capable driver unit, but the V-shaped frequency response lowers the overall score for scientific validity. The 16ฮฉ impedance offers the convenience of being easy to drive, but it does not imply scientific superiority in sound quality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ALCP diaphragm technology is an effective approach to balancing rigidity and lightweight construction in the 40mm driver. The aluminum coating for improved high-frequency characteristics is technically rational, and the standard support for a 4.4mm balanced connection reflects the design philosophy of its time. The 187g lightweight design with high-quality synthetic leather ear pads is excellent engineering for long-term wearing comfort. However, as of 2025, these technologies are within the standard range and cannot be considered particularly innovative.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This product has been discontinued, but its market price at the time of this review is approximately 246 USD. Based on its measurement-based performance (frequency response, distortion, etc.), more affordable products exist that are considered to have a more faithful frequency response, such as the AKG K371 (market price approx. 133 USD). Although the K371 does not support a balanced connection, its fundamental acoustic performance is comparable or in some aspects superior to the MDR-1AM2. Calculation: 133 USD รท 246 USD = 0.54, which means its cost-performance is not high.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The basic quality control and warranty system of the Sony brand meets industry standards. However, as of 2025, this product has been discontinued. Therefore, obtaining a new unit is difficult, and there are concerns about future manufacturer repair support (after the parts retention period ends). While specific data on initial failure rates or MTBF is not publicly available, reliability equivalent to Sony's general consumer products can be expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The direction of supporting Hi-Res Audio is rational in pursuing potential sound quality improvements. The physical property enhancements from the ALCP diaphragm and the support for balanced connection, which reduces crosstalk, contribute to measurable performance gains. However, the choice of a V-shaped consumer-oriented tuning deviates from the pure pursuit of source transparency. This reflects a design philosophy that emphasizes subjective values like "musical enjoyment" and prioritizes market preferences over the scientific rationality of a dedicated audio device.

## Advice

The MDR-1AM2 is an attractive choice for users who prioritize its exceptional lightweight design (187g) and comfortable fit. However, this product is no longer in production, and its V-shaped sound character makes it unsuitable for those seeking high-fidelity reproduction. The 4.4mm balanced connection is a plus, but if this feature is not a requirement, current products like the AKG K371 offer superior performance in objective measurements at a lower price. It would be a more rational decision to consider currently available models that better suit your needs rather than searching for this specific model.
