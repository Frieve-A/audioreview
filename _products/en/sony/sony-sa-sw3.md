## Overview

The Sony SA-SW3 is a 200W wireless subwoofer designed exclusively for BRAVIA THEATER and HT-A9/A7000/A5000/A3000/S2000, STR-AN1000 systems. It features a 160mm (6.3-inch) driver and employs 5.0GHz RF wireless transmission. The unit incorporates Σ (Sigma) magnetic circuit technology and Separated Notch Edge technology to reduce cone distortion. Released in 2021, it adopts Sony's proprietary Omnidirectional Block design concept as a compact subwoofer solution.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

With 200W output and 160mm driver, official specifications claim a frequency range of 28-200Hz. The bass reflex design and Σ magnetic circuit technology aim to maximize magnetic force, while Separated Notch Edge technology improves vertical amplitude symmetry. However, specific THD values and detailed S/N ratio measurement data are not publicly available. Professional measurement data from third-party institutions could not be confirmed, limiting the evaluation of scientific validity. Some user reports mention bass setting limitations, but these remain unverified subjective assessments.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Σ magnetic circuit technology and Separated Notch Edge technology represent Sony's proprietary design approach. The 5.0GHz RF wireless connection is a rational choice to avoid 2.4GHz band congestion. The combination of 160mm driver design and bass reflex configuration shows technical consideration for low-frequency reproduction in a compact enclosure. However, these technologies do not reach industry-leading standards, and the limitation to dedicated system connectivity restricts their technological advantages.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Current market research shows the Sony SA-SW3 sells for approximately 398 USD with price fluctuations. Compared to the equivalent-function Polk React Sub (180-199 USD, with price variations), the minimum price comparison yields 180 USD ÷ 398 USD = 0.452, resulting in approximately 0.5 cost-performance score. However, both products experience significant price volatility, and the Polk React Sub features a 7-inch driver compared to Sony SA-SW3's slightly smaller 6.3-inch unit. Both products share the limitation of being dedicated to specific soundbar ecosystems, lacking versatility.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sony brand reliability maintains a certain standard, but the dedicated system limitation creates risks regarding future compatibility and upgrade scenarios. While wireless connection stability receives high user ratings, specific information about repair support and long-term service is limited. Industry-average warranty coverage is presumed, but the dedicated nature raises concerns about support continuity compared to universal products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy of exclusive compatibility with specific Sony soundbars and AV receivers sacrifices versatility. While the 5.0GHz RF dedicated wireless communication is technically superior, it constrains continued use when users change systems. The official specification of 28-200Hz represents an appropriate low-frequency reproduction range, but equivalent frequency ranges are achievable with universal wireless subwoofers. While the optimization through Σ magnetic circuit technology and Separated Notch Edge technology is commendable, the dedicated system limitation restricts long-term product value.

## Advice

The Sony SA-SW3 can only be recommended for users who already own compatible Sony soundbars or AV receivers and plan to remain within the Sony ecosystem. The 28-200Hz frequency range and 200W output meet basic requirements, but alternatives exist in the 398 USD price range. We recommend comparing with competing products like the price-volatile Polk React Sub. Given the dedicated system limitation, users with potential future system changes should consider more versatile subwoofers. We strongly recommend auditioning before purchase to confirm actual sound quality.
