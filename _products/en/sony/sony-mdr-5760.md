## Overview

The Sony MDR-5760 is a discontinued vintage noise-cancelling headphone model specifically manufactured for Japan Airlines (JAL). This B2B aviation product features active noise cancellation powered by AAA batteries and uses dual-prong airline connectors, making it primarily suitable for in-flight use without adapters. As a vintage airline-specific product, it represents analog noise cancellation technology from an earlier era without modern digital integration or standard connectivity options.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

When credible third-party measurements are unavailable and even manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data. The MDR-5760 has no publicly available frequency response measurements, THD data, S/N ratio specifications, dynamic range measurements, or detailed noise cancellation performance metrics. As a vintage airline-specific product, no professional audio measurement laboratories have tested this model, and Sony has not published comprehensive technical specifications for this B2B aviation product. Following the framework guidance for products with insufficient measurement data, the score is set to the baseline value of 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The MDR-5760 represents vintage analog noise cancellation technology that has been superseded by modern digital ANC implementations. While the product lacks contemporary features such as Bluetooth connectivity, USB-C charging, digital signal processing, or advanced noise cancellation algorithms, it served its specialized airline application adequately during its production era. The analog-only approach and dual-prong airline connector design addressed specific technical requirements for aviation entertainment systems, though this technology is now outdated compared to current noise-cancelling implementations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Current market price for the MDR-5760 is approximately 45 USD (used condition). Equivalent functionality can be achieved with modern active noise-cancelling headphones paired with dual-prong airline adapters. The Soundcore Life Q20 (40 USD) combined with a dual-prong airline adapter (8 USD) provides equivalent airline entertainment system compatibility with superior digital noise cancellation, longer battery life, and additional connectivity options. Equipped with active noise cancellation and airline compatibility via adapter, frequency response and noise cancellation performance are equivalent-or-better than the analog implementation. CP = 45 USD ÷ 48 USD = 0.9.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

As a discontinued vintage product available only in the used market, the MDR-5760 offers no manufacturer warranty, no official support infrastructure, and no spare parts availability from Sony. Users must rely on third-party repair services or vintage audio specialists for any maintenance needs. The product line support has ended, leaving no official channels for technical assistance or repairs. The inherent reliability of older analog components may also be compromised due to age and lack of quality control in the used market.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The MDR-5760's design philosophy reflects its specific airline application context, where the dual-prong connector and analog noise cancellation served a practical purpose for in-flight entertainment systems. While the technology is outdated by current standards, the original design addressed specific functional requirements for aviation use. The analog-only approach lacks the scientific measurement focus and digital integration that characterize modern rational audio design. The product represents conservative approaches that have been superseded by superior modern implementations, but it did serve its intended specialized purpose during its production era.

## Advice

The Sony MDR-5760 is primarily of interest to vintage audio collectors, aviation history enthusiasts, or frequent airline travelers seeking immediate compatibility without adapters. However, modern alternatives like the Soundcore Life Q20 paired with dual-prong adapters offer equivalent airline functionality at similar cost while providing superior performance, reliability, and versatility. The lack of manufacturer support poses risks for long-term reliability, and users must rely on third-party repair services. For general listening purposes, modern noise-cancelling headphones offer superior features, and the adapter solution provides both airline compatibility and broader functionality at competitive pricing.
