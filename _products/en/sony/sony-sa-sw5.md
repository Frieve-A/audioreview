summary: "A 5 GHz wireless subwoofer designed to pair only with compatible Sony soundbars/AVRs. Sony publishes FTC 130 W RMS (28–200 Hz, 2 Ω, ≤1% THD), but independent measurements are scarce. With no cheaper function-equivalent alternative, CP=1.0."

## Overview

$$ \Large \text{3.0} $$

The SA-SW5 is a dedicated wireless subwoofer for Sony systems such as BRAVIA THEATER (BAR 9 / BAR 8 / QUAD), HT-A9, HT-A7000/5000/3000, HT-S2000, and the STR-AN1000 receiver[1][3][4]. It uses a 180 mm driver with a 200×300 mm passive radiator in a 277×409×422 mm, 13.0 kg enclosure[1][2]. Connectivity is via Sony’s proprietary 5 GHz wireless link—not Bluetooth[2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comprehensive third-party measurements (frequency response with ±dB tolerance, THD vs output, CEA-2010 max SPL) are not publicly available. Manufacturer documentation lists an FTC-rated continuous output of 130 W (2 Ω, 28–200 Hz band, ≤1% THD) and a 300 W reference at 100 Hz[2]. Driver and radiator sizes are specified[2]. Retail specs often state 28–200 Hz, but without tolerance this remains catalog information rather than verified transparency[5].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sony implements the Σ Magnetic Circuit, Separated Notch Edge surround, an S-Master digital amplifier, and a dedicated 5 GHz wireless (Wireless Sound Specification v4.0)[2][3]. These reflect competent engineering but do not, by themselves, demonstrate measured leadership. Net: a bit above industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

With a representative U.S. market price of 699 USD[3], we found **no cheaper product** that offers the same **user-level function** (native wireless pairing to the supported Sony systems) with equal-or-better measured performance[3][4]. Under this condition, CP is 1.0 (the target is the cheapest equivalent option).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Sony provides a standard 1-year limited warranty for home audio in many regions and maintains broad service coverage[6]. As a wireless sub, occasional placement-dependent interference is possible, but overall support infrastructure is typical. Firmware handling is primarily through the host device; sub-only user firmware release is uncommon[2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Prioritizing easy placement via proprietary 5 GHz and seamless pairing is rational for real-world use[2][3]. However, absent third-party, measurement-first validation of acoustic performance, the approach leans more toward ecosystem convenience than proven transparency—hence a neutral score.

## Advice

If you already own a compatible Sony bar/receiver and want cable-free integration, the SA-SW5 fits neatly. It provides clear manufacturer numbers—FTC 130 W RMS (28–200 Hz, 2 Ω, ≤1% THD)—but lacks independent verification of response linearity and distortion ceilings[2]. If native Sony wireless pairing is not required, an AVR plus a high-measured wired sub remains an alternative path; for strict Sony wireless pairing, the SA-SW5 is effectively the top option.
