## Overview

The SA-W3000 is a 12-inch powered subwoofer from Sony’s mid-2000s lineup. Core functions include adjustable low-pass (50–200 Hz), phase switch, line/speaker-level inputs, auto power, and a magnetically shielded enclosure suitable for proximity to CRT displays [1]. Sony’s circuit implements an MFB (Motional Feed Back) loop in the sub module, and retail literature of the time described a “Mica-reinforced” 12-inch cone [1][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Independent acoustic measurements (CEA-2010 max SPL, distortion vs SPL, ±dB on-axis response) are unavailable. Manufacturer/service-manual data specify **100 W RMS with ≤1% THD from 20–200 Hz** for the U.S. model; other regional listings cite **160–180 W at 80 Hz, 10% THD** (continuous) [1]. Frequency range is stated as **20–200 Hz** with no tolerance [1][3]. With key audible-performance metrics unverified, we start from a neutral 0.5 and adjust downward due to reliance on catalog figures and absence of third-party validation, resulting in 0.4.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design reflects conventional analog subwoofer architecture of its era: a vented cabinet, analog low-pass (50–200 Hz), phase selector, auto standby, and **Motional Feed Back (MFB)** in the signal path [1]. There is no built-in DSP room correction or modern connectivity. While MFB is a rational control approach, implementation details are basic by today’s standards. No recent patents or unique system integration are evident in public materials.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Price basis (review target):** 145 USD (representative used-market level; multiple listings show **18,980–22,000 円** ≈ mid-100 USD range) [6].  
**Comparator (equal-or-better):** **BIC America F12** — 12-inch powered sub; **150 W RMS / 475 W peak**, **25–200 Hz** spec, adjustable crossover, **RCA and speaker-level inputs**; commonly available new around **249 USD** (representative Amazon deal thread; also see manufacturer specs) [4][5][7].  
**Equivalence note:** Same user-facing function (12-inch powered sub with line/speaker inputs, adjustable crossover). On paper the F12’s amplifier rating and low-frequency capability are at least comparable or higher than the SA-W3000’s catalog figures [1][4][7].

We could not identify any **new** 12-inch powered subwoofers with equal-or-better published performance available for **≤145 USD** at the time of writing; therefore **no cheaper equivalent exists** and **CP = 1.0** under the site’s rule.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This legacy model is **discontinued**; official pages provide manuals but not current sales or warranty coverage [2]. Manufacturer warranty for new purchases is not applicable, and **support period for this specific model has ended** [2]. There is no public failure-rate dataset for the SA-W3000 (neutral). Sony operates a global support framework for active products (neutral to mildly positive context), but for this model, practical support is limited to documentation and any paid repair services available in a given region [2]. Balancing the ended model support (negative) with otherwise standard brand infrastructure and absence of hard failure data (neutral), the score is **0.5**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The SA-W3000’s philosophy—basic analog filtering plus MFB—was reasonable in its time, but lacks modern measurement-first features such as on-board DSP equalization or auto room correction that directly improve in-room bass accuracy. With no published independent performance data demonstrating transparency, the approach reads as conservative rather than progressive [1][3].

## Advice

If you can secure a clean unit near **145 USD**, the SA-W3000 remains a practical way to add bass on a tight budget, provided expectations are modest and you accept the risks of a legacy product. If you want new-unit support and stronger on-paper capability, the **BIC F12** is a common step-up option around **249 USD** with readily available parts and warranty [4][5]. For best results with any subwoofer, prioritize careful placement and integration (crossover/phase/level) and consider an external DSP/room-EQ solution if accuracy is a priority.
