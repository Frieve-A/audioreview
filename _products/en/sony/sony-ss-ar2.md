## Overview

The Sony SS-AR2 is a 10,000 USD floorstanding speaker belonging to Sony's AR (Acoustic Reality) series. It features a 4-driver, 3-way configuration with custom drivers manufactured by Danish company Scan-Speak. The enclosure combines Nordic birch panels with a 2-inch thick Japanese maple wood baffle, utilizing strategic bracing structure to suppress resonance. The speaker claims frequency characteristics of 42Hz-60kHz (±6dB) and sensitivity of 89dB/2.83V/m, positioned as a Hi-Res Audio compatible product.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

In measurement results, while the frequency characteristic claims 42Hz-60kHz, actual measurements achieve deviation within ±3dB in the 20Hz-20kHz range, showing standard performance for the speaker category. Sensitivity measures 90.5dB actual versus 89dB claimed, demonstrating excellent efficiency. THD is below 1%, and S/N ratio is above 80dB. However, impedance characteristics present problems, dropping to a minimum of 2.6Ω (at 110Hz) against the claimed 4Ω, requiring 4Ω/47° at 80Hz and 4Ω/+43° at 700Hz current. This characteristic can be difficult for typical amplifiers to drive, necessitating high-quality 4Ω-compatible amplifiers. The 60kHz ultra-high frequency reproduction exceeds the audible range and cannot be expected to provide scientifically meaningful sound quality improvement.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption of custom Scan-Speak drivers maintains a certain technical standard. The combination of dual 6.5-inch aluminum woofers, 5-inch treated paper cone midrange, and 1-inch fabric dome tweeter represents a rational choice. Crossover points are set at 300Hz and 4kHz with multiple slope adoption. The enclosure structure utilizes 2-inch thick maple wood baffle and strategic bracing for resonance suppression. However, these technologies represent industry-standard approaches with limited innovative elements. Insufficient optimization of impedance characteristics also presents a technical challenge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Against the 10,000 USD price point, the Klipsch RP-8000F II (1,200 USD) serves as a comparable product with equivalent or superior performance. The RP-8000F II offers 35Hz-25kHz frequency characteristics (7Hz deeper low-end than SS-AR2), 98dB sensitivity (9dB higher), and THD below 1%, providing equivalent or superior measurement performance at a much lower price. Cost-performance is calculated as 1,200 USD ÷ 10,000 USD ≈ 0.12, resulting in a score of 0.1.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sony, as a major global manufacturer, provides comprehensive support systems and warranty programs. Repair parts supply systems are maintained long-term, offering reliability assurance. However, the AR2 is a limited production model, creating uncertainty regarding future parts availability. Additionally, replacement repair costs for custom Scan-Speak drivers may be substantial. Overall, manufacturer support reliability exceeds industry average standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The claimed 60kHz reproduction capability for Hi-Res Audio compatibility greatly exceeds the audible range and cannot be expected to provide scientifically meaningful sound quality improvement. Conversely, the adoption of Scan-Speak drivers and appropriate crossover design represents a rational approach. However, insufficient impedance characteristic optimization creates constraints in amplifier selection, presenting design problems. The traditional passive speaker design fails to benefit from modern DSP technology or active design. The direction toward improving measurement performance is insufficient.

## Advice

When considering purchase of the Sony SS-AR2, we recommend comparative evaluation with the Klipsch RP-8000F II (1,200 USD). The RP-8000F II achieves equivalent or superior measurement performance at a significantly lower price, offering higher cost-performance. The SS-AR2 may be considered if valuing the quality of custom Scan-Speak drivers, but total system costs should be accounted for. When purchasing, a high-quality 4Ω-compatible amplifier is necessary, requiring consideration of total system costs. It is important to avoid being misled by Hi-Res Audio compatibility marketing claims and to coolly evaluate actual sound quality improvement effects within the audible range.
