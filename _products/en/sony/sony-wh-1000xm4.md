## Overview

The Sony WH-1000XM4 is Sony's 2020 premium wireless ANC over-ear. It uses the **HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1** working with a Bluetooth Audio SoC (no "V1" integrated processor on this model) and supports Bluetooth 5.0 with **LDAC/AAC/SBC**. Sony's dual-noise-sensor system monitors audio and noise "over **700 times per second**," enabling effective real-time cancellation. Multipoint pairing and a foldable design round out the feature set. [1][3][4][7]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

- **Driver matching & distortion:** Independent lab measurements show well-matched L/R drivers and low harmonic distortion at typical listening levels. [1]  
- **Sensitivity / impedance (wired):** **113.6 dB/V SPL** sensitivity and **~17.7 Ω** average impedance were measured by Reference Audio Analyzer. [2]  
- **ANC effectiveness:** On RTINGS' standardized test, WH-1000XM4 delivers **overall attenuation ≈ −27.1 dB**, with strong low-frequency reduction (plane/bus rumble) and useful mid/high-frequency attenuation. [5][6]  
- **Wireless tech:** Bluetooth **5.0**; codecs **LDAC, AAC, SBC** (no aptX family). [3][7]

These quantified results substantiate claims about strong ANC and competent wireless performance. The stock tuning is intentionally **bass-elevated** versus neutral targets (good for casual listening, less ideal for strict fidelity), which is consistent across measurement sources. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

QN1-based ANC with dual external mics and a Bluetooth SoC sampling and adapting at **>700 Hz** was state-of-the-art for 2020 and remains solid, but newer flagships (including Sony's own successors) have advanced processing and mic systems. [4]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

- **Current market price (U.S.)**: **199.99 USD** (Best Buy, Aug 2025). [8]  
- **Cheapest equal-or-better alternatives?** Competing models with comparable or superior ANC (e.g., Bose QuietComfort line, Sony XM5/XM6, Apple AirPods Max) are **≥229 USD** at the time of writing, and many measure **less** total attenuation than XM4 or cost substantially more. For example, **Bose QC45 ≈ 229 USD** and measures **≈ −23.9 dB** overall ANC (weaker). [9][10][11]  

Because no **cheaper** product meets or exceeds XM4's core performance/feature set (ANC effectiveness, multipoint, LDAC support, build) at this time, XM4 earns the maximum cost-performance rating.

*(Japan reference price for domestic readers: lowest **27,500円** on Kakaku.com as of Aug 2025; this aligns with the high value proposition at current U.S. pricing.)* [12]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sony provides a **1-year** limited warranty in the U.S. and Canada (extendable via optional protection plans). Coverage is limited to defects in materials/workmanship per the official warranty terms. [13][14][15] Sony's global support site provides firmware and documentation. [16]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Engineering priority is clearly on effective ANC, battery life (up to ~30 hours), comfort, and travel usability (folding case, multipoint). The warm factory EQ favors mainstream preferences; the app EQ helps users shift closer to neutral if desired. [1][7]

## Advice

If you want **top-tier ANC at the lowest price**, XM4 is a smart buy in 2025. If you prioritize absolute ANC or mic performance, consider newer flagships (Sony XM5/XM6, Bose QC Ultra) at higher prices. For longer battery life and a somewhat more neutral tonality, **Sennheiser Momentum 4** is a solid alternative (usually **>250 USD**). [1][10][11]
