summary: "Rugged portable Bluetooth speaker with 2‑way drivers, passive radiators and IP67. Strong bass via the ULT button, 24‑hour battery, multipoint and Party Connect. Measurements fall short of transparency, while price‑to‑performance is favorable versus the cheapest equivalent competitor."

## Overview

The Sony ULT Field 3 is a portable Bluetooth speaker released in 2025 as part of the ULT POWER SOUND series. It features a 2-way active design with dedicated woofers and tweeters, combined with two passive radiators to achieve a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz. The speaker includes IP67 waterproof, dustproof, rust-resistant, and shock-resistant performance with a built-in battery providing 24 hours of continuous playback. It incorporates multiple outdoor-focused features including the ULT button for bass enhancement and Party Connect functionality supporting up to 100 connected units.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Credible third‑party measurements indicate the ULT Field 3 does not reach transparent‑level performance. Low‑frequency extension relies on passive radiators and shows roll‑off typical of the size class, and distortion rises at higher output levels especially with ULT engaged, which conflicts with transparency targets. Wireless codecs are SBC/AAC only; no objective advantage from higher‑bit‑rate codecs is present here [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 2-way active driver configuration represents a standard industry approach, with the combination of 20mm tweeters and large mid-bass woofers being a reasonable design choice. The adoption of passive radiators for low-frequency extension is also conventional technology. IP67-rated waterproof and dustproof performance represents standard level for current portable speakers without notable technical advantages. Party Connect and stereo pairing functions are applications of existing technology. Overall, the implementation lacks uniqueness or technological advancement, remaining at industry average technical standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Comparison follows the policy: select the single world‑cheapest product with equivalent‑or‑better user‑facing functions and measured performance. JBL Charge 6 at 179.95 USD matches or exceeds key functions for this class (IP68 water/dust resistance, similar battery endurance, robust measured FR/THD datasets) and is cheaper than the ULT Field 3 US street price of 199.99 USD [4][5][6]. Calculation (denominator is always the review target):

CP = 179.95 USD ÷ 199.99 USD = 0.90 → rounded to 0.9.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Global sales and service channels are established; warranty and support are assessed as industry‑average. As a new model, public long‑term failure‑rate and firmware update cadence data are limited [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The focus on ruggedness, endurance, and multi‑speaker linking is rational for outdoor use. However, bass‑boost (ULT) at high output trades transparency for impact, and the lack of higher‑bit‑rate codec support does not push measured performance ceilings [1][2].

## Advice

If you value rugged build, strong bass at casual levels, and long battery life, the ULT Field 3 is a viable pick. If cost‑performance is the priority, JBL Charge 6 offers equivalent‑or‑better functions with widely available third‑party measurements at a lower US price. Evaluate distortion behavior at your typical volume with and without ULT, and check feature priorities (multipoint, app EQ, linking) before purchase [2][4][5].
