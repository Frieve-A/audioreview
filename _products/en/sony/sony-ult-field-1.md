summary: "Sony's new compact portable speaker. It offers solid fundamentals like the ULT bass boost function, IP67 waterproofing, and a 12-hour battery. However, its cost-performance is rated extremely low due to the existence of the Anker Soundcore 3, which offers similar basic performance at less than half the price. It also lacks a clear advantage over competitors like the JBL Flip 6 in terms of sound quality and features, making it difficult to justify its price."

## Overview

The Sony ULT FIELD 1 is Sony's latest entry into the compact portable speaker market. Weighing 650g, it combines portability with IP67-rated waterproof, dustproof, and rustproof performance for outdoor applications. The driver configuration consists of a 2-way system with an 83mm × 42mm woofer and approximately 16mm tweeter, supporting Bluetooth 5.3 with SBC and AAC codecs. Its most distinctive feature is the ULT bass boost function, which allows one-touch low-frequency enhancement. Battery life is rated at up to 12 hours, and it includes practical features like a detachable multi-strap and hands-free calling capability. The manufacturer claims a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz, but 20Hz reproduction from a 650g compact speaker is physically unrealistic, with actual performance being limited.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Measurement results show the ULT FIELD 1 achieves relatively balanced sound quality for its size class. Mid and high frequencies are smooth, with good reproduction of vocals and primary instruments. Even with the ULT function enabled, low-frequency extension remains limited due to physical size constraints, and deep bass like that from large speakers cannot be expected. Directivity is not optimal, requiring careful attention to speaker placement. Additionally, the specification to downmix stereo content to mono limits the spatial information in music. Compression and distortion at maximum volume levels have been confirmed numerically, showing sound quality degradation during high-volume use.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The technical level of the ULT FIELD 1 is standard for a modern compact speaker. The 2-way driver configuration (woofer + tweeter) and the adoption of Bluetooth 5.3 are rational, but its support for only SBC and AAC codecs, lacking higher-quality options like aptX or LDAC, is a clear weakness.

In addition to its IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating, the design incorporates shock resistance for falls, making its outdoor durability highly commendable. It also features a "Stereo Pair" function, allowing two units to be linked for stereo playback.

On the other hand, its maximum battery life of 12 hours is inferior to competitors like the Anker Soundcore 3 (up to 24 hours) and the UE BOOM 3 (up to 15 hours). The ULT bass boost function falls within the scope of existing loudness technologies and offers limited technical novelty. Overall, it is a practical design that balances cost and durability, but it is assessed as lacking in technical innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The cost-performance of the ULT FIELD 1 at its 130 USD MSRP must be rated as low.

When comparing pure performance and price, the Anker Soundcore 3 is available for about 60 USD. The Soundcore 3 offers very balanced sound quality for its price range, IPX7 waterproof performance, and double the battery life at 24 hours. While the ULT FIELD 1's bass-boosted sound is distinctive, it lacks a clear advantage in sound quality to justify the price difference, and in some aspects of overall performance, the Soundcore 3 is significantly superior.

Calculating the cost-performance based on this fact:

`CP = 60 USD (Anker Soundcore 3) ÷ 130 USD (Sony ULT FIELD 1) ≈ 0.46`

The ULT bass boost function is not significantly different from a general loudness feature and does not add enough value to overturn this calculation. The fact that a product with comparable performance is available for less than half the price clearly indicates that this product's pricing is not aligned with its performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As a major electronics manufacturer, Sony's support system is at a standard level. The product typically comes with a one-year manufacturer's warranty, and repair services are available through its global service network. The IP67-compliant design enhances confidence in its durability under normal use.

However, due to the nature of portable speakers, the deterioration of the built-in battery over time is unavoidable. Battery replacement after the warranty period can be costly, making it essentially a consumable item. Firmware updates may be provided, but long-term support is not guaranteed.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ULT FIELD 1's design philosophy represents a rational approach focused on mainstream needs in the portable speaker market. IP67 waterproof performance for outdoor use, compact size considering usability, and the ULT function for easy bass enhancement appropriately capture general user scenarios. However, technical innovation and originality are limited, giving the impression of a standard product combining existing technologies. The downmixing of stereo content to mono and lack of high-quality codec support reveal cost-priority design choices, representing an approach that prioritizes market competitiveness over pure sound quality pursuit. Nevertheless, the consistent design with clear awareness of price range and target users can be evaluated as rational.

## Advice

When considering the purchase of the ULT FIELD 1, its low cost-performance must be fully understood.

If pure price-to-performance is the top priority, the Anker Soundcore 3 (approx. 60 USD) is an overwhelmingly superior choice. It offers comparable sound quality and double the battery performance at less than half the price of the ULT FIELD 1.

For those seeking higher performance in the same price range (around 130 USD), the JBL Flip 6, which supports stereo playback and has richer codec support, should be considered.

The reasons to choose this product are extremely limited. Except for cases where you absolutely want to stay within the Sony ecosystem or if it is heavily discounted to a price close to the Anker Soundcore 3, there is no compelling reason to recommend it. While its basic performance is solid, its pricing is detached from the market reality, and many smarter alternatives exist.
