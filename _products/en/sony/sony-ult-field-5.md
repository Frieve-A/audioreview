## Overview

The Sony ULT FIELD 5 (SRS-ULT50) is a portable Bluetooth speaker released in April 2025. It features a 2.1ch configuration with an X‑Balanced Speaker Unit using an approx. 79×107 mm woofer and two 46 mm tweeters, with bass enhancement via the ULT button. It offers IP67 water/dust resistance, up to about 25 hours of battery life, and party lighting, and weighs approximately 3.3 kg.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are no publicly verified measurement datasets available to us (per our standard FR/distortion/MDaQS criteria). In line with policy, the baseline score is set to 0.5.

Reference numeric specs (as far as confirmable)
- Dimensions: approx. 320 × 144 × 125 mm
- Weight: approx. 3.3 kg
- Battery: up to about 25 hours
- IP rating: IP67
- Bluetooth: 5.3 (profiles/codecs not yet confirmed from primary sources)
- Drivers: approx. 79×107 mm woofer ×1, 46 mm tweeters ×2, dual passive radiators

ULT modes intentionally shape bass; a final transparency judgment should be revisited once measurements are available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The non-circular X‑Balanced driver design targets lower distortion via larger effective diaphragm area and is now common. Dual passive radiators for bass extension are also standard. App-based EQ and lighting control are available, but remain software-side optimizations; no breakthrough proprietary technology is evident.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Requirement: compare against the world‑lowest priced product that is not inferior in features (equal‑or‑better).

- This product's observed lowest new price (example): 177 USD
- Equal‑or‑better candidate: Sony ULT FIELD 7 (SRS‑ULT70)
  - Advantages/equality: IP67, battery around 30 h (≥25 h), bass‑boost modes, lighting, party connection, and overall functionality at least equal or better
  - Observed lowest new price (example): 303 USD

Ratio = 303 ÷ 177 ≈ 1.72 → rounded to the ceiling score of 1.0

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sony’s established support and standard warranty apply. IP67 water/dust resistance and up to about 25 hours of playback aid practical reliability. Software updates and settings are handled via the "Sony | Music Center" app. Long‑term failure data is not yet available, so differentiation remains standard.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The bass‑focused concept is explicit, with ULT modes deliberately emphasizing low frequencies. This differs from strict Hi‑Fi neutrality, but clearly balances durability (IP67), long battery life, and lighting features. A final sound quality judgment should be revisited once measurements are available.

## Advice

ULT FIELD 5 suits use cases prioritizing weather resistance (IP67), long runtime, and portability. If sound quality is your top priority, audition first and verify ULT/EQ settings for your music. Until measurements are available, starting with more neutral settings is a safe choice.
