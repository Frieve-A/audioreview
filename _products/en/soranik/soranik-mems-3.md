## Overview

The Soranik MEMS-3 represents a pioneering achievement in consumer audio technology as the world's first in-ear monitors to implement full-range MEMS speakers. This hybrid IEM combines a single xMEMS microspeaker, one full-range dynamic driver, and one subwoofer dynamic driver in an open-back design. Established in 2012, Vietnam-based Soranik has positioned itself as an innovative audio company targeting both enthusiasts and professionals. The MEMS-3 requires an external energizer unit (AP-0 included, AP-1 recommended) to drive the MEMS components and features 3D printed ergonomic shells with 2-pin 0.78mm connectivity. At 1,600-2,200 USD, this product represents cutting-edge audio engineering attempting to bridge semiconductor precision with traditional acoustic design.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

When credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack comprehensive audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated and is set to 0.5. While the xMEMS component specifications indicate promising performance (20Hz-20kHz frequency response, ±1° phase consistency) [1], the complete MEMS-3 system lacks critical measurements required for proper evaluation including harmonic distortion (THD/THD+N), signal-to-noise ratio, intermodulation distortion, dynamic range, and crosstalk data. Third-party reviews describe a U-shaped frequency response with sub-bass focus but provide only general descriptions rather than quantified measurements [2]. The open-back design intentionally sacrifices passive isolation, which is acceptable for the intended soundstage expansion but places the product below the 10dB problematic threshold for sound isolation. Until comprehensive independent measurements become available, the actual audible performance relative to transparent listening thresholds cannot be scientifically validated.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Soranik achieves the maximum Technology Level score through its pioneering implementation of full-range MEMS speakers in consumer audio products. The company demonstrates exceptional technical expertise by successfully integrating monolithic silicon-based xMEMS speakers with traditional dynamic drivers, representing cutting-edge semiconductor audio technology [1][3]. This hybrid approach combines state-of-the-art silicon foundry manufacturing processes capable of producing billions of units with precise acoustic engineering. The technology represents genuine innovation that other manufacturers will likely require years to replicate, establishing substantial competitive advantages. MEMS speakers offer theoretical benefits including superior high-frequency response, enhanced clarity, flat frequency response characteristics, and high reliability through reduced moving parts [1]. The integration of advanced electronics with precision acoustic design matches smartphone-era technological sophistication. While requiring external energization adds complexity, it enables the advanced MEMS technology implementation. The company's design ownership of this unique hybrid configuration and adoption of cutting-edge audio reproduction technology justifies the maximum score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The MEMS-3 offers 2-pin 0.78mm connectivity and open-back design at 1,600 USD (base price used for cost-performance calculation). While manufacturer specifications indicate frequency response 20Hz-20kHz [1], comprehensive measurement data including THD, S/N ratio, IMD, dynamic range, and crosstalk are unavailable, making this a provisional comparison. Based solely on measured performance values, the 7Hz Salnotes Zero (22.99 USD) provides 2-pin 0.78mm connectivity, third-party frequency response measurements, and THD < 1% specification, offering equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance [5][6]. CP = 22.99 USD ÷ 1,600 USD = 0.014, rounded to 0.0. Even considering the limited measurement data for MEMS-3, products with equivalent-or-better measured performance exist at substantially lower prices, resulting in extremely poor cost-performance evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Soranik demonstrates reasonable reliability potential through its established 12-year track record since 2012 and the inherently robust construction of MEMS technology, which features fewer moving parts than traditional drivers [4]. The company provides customer support through Vietnam-based operations with contact information available via phone and email, operating Monday through Friday 8 AM to 6 PM PST [4]. However, the limited global support infrastructure compared to major international audio manufacturers reduces overall accessibility for users outside Vietnam. Warranty period information is not publicly available from official sources, representing a limitation for prospective buyers requiring specific coverage terms. The MEMS technology's silicon-based construction offers potential longevity advantages through semiconductor-grade manufacturing processes, but the external energizer requirement adds another component that could require support. The company's regional focus limits repair and replacement accessibility for global customers compared to manufacturers with worldwide service networks.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Soranik demonstrates strong rationality through its scientific approach to audio reproduction using cutting-edge MEMS technology that represents genuine audio-specific innovation. The company's focus on measurable technical specifications including frequency response, phase consistency, and precision manufacturing aligns with rational design philosophy [1]. The MEMS implementation addresses legitimate acoustic engineering challenges through semiconductor precision, potentially offering benefits in frequency response accuracy, phase consistency, and manufacturing repeatability. However, the high pricing without comprehensive measurement validation and some unsubstantiated claims about audible benefits reduce the rationality score. The company's pioneering approach to MEMS integration demonstrates innovation rather than conservative adherence to traditional audio approaches. The requirement for external energization, while adding complexity, enables advanced MEMS technology implementation that would be impossible with traditional passive designs. The combination of cutting-edge semiconductor technology with acoustic engineering represents functional integration suited to advancing audio reproduction capabilities, though the cost-effectiveness relative to measured improvements requires additional validation through independent testing.

## Advice

The MEMS-3 appeals primarily to early adopters seeking cutting-edge audio technology and those interested in experiencing the world's first full-range MEMS implementation in consumer IEMs. Consider this product if you prioritize technological innovation, appreciate open-back soundstage characteristics, and can accommodate the external energizer requirement in your listening setup. The 1,600-2,200 USD investment represents access to unique MEMS technology unavailable elsewhere at this price point, though conventional hybrid IEMs may offer superior measured performance per dollar. Wait for independent measurement data before purchasing if scientific validation of performance claims is important to your decision. The AP-1 energizer upgrade is reportedly essential for optimal performance, representing additional cost beyond the base price. Users requiring passive noise isolation should avoid this product due to the intentional open-back design. Consider conventional hybrid IEMs if pure acoustic performance per dollar is the primary concern, or wait for second-generation MEMS products with proven measurement validation and broader market acceptance.
