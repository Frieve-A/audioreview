## Overview

The PMC Prodigy5 is an entry-level floorstanding speaker from PMC, a long-established British studio monitor manufacturer. Featuring the company's proprietary ATL (Advanced Transmission Line) technology, it achieves a frequency response of 35Hz-25kHz (-3dB) and sensitivity of 87.3dB. With a slim design of 905mm height and 10kg weight, it employs a 2-way configuration with a 13.3cm fiber cone woofer and 27mm soft dome tweeter.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Per manufacturer specifications: frequency response 35Hz–25kHz (-3dB), sensitivity 87.3dB (approx. 2.83V/1m), nominal impedance 6Ω, crossover 1.7kHz [1]. These are standard values for this size class and indicate typical drive requirements for common amplifiers. High-density third-party datasets (e.g., full on/off-axis set and THD curves) are limited at the time of writing, though independent review coverage exists; therefore this section relies primarily on official specs and will be revised when rigorous external data is published [3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PMC's proprietary ATL technology incorporates a 1.96m folded transmission line inside the cabinet, representing a rational design for bass extension in compact enclosures. The tweeter adopts an improved version of the driver used in PMC's studio monitor Result6, featuring a 27mm dome diaphragm combined with an acoustic grille structure. The woofer is derived from the company's ci series using a fiber cone diaphragm. However, this is essentially a combination of existing technologies with limited innovative elements. Manufacturing quality shows the solid craftsmanship typical of British products, though not at industry-leading levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Market price: 2,933 USD equivalent (440,000円 domestic listing converted to USD) [2]. As an equal-or-better comparator with published third-party measurements, we select the Polk Reserve R700 (excellent NFS-measured directivity and bass extension) [4]. As of 2025-08-10, a major retailer lists the R700 at 2,199 USD per pair [5]. Hence, per policy formula:

CP = 2,199 USD ÷ 2,933 USD = 0.75 → 0.8

Because an equal-or-better option exists at a lower price, CP is evaluated at 0.8 [4][5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

PMC is a British manufacturer established in 1991 with a solid reputation in the studio monitor field. The product warranty period is at standard levels, with domestic authorized dealer support systems in place. However, as a passive speaker, long-term reliability data is limited, and while not a startup company, it cannot be said to have industry-leading support systems. Manufacturing quality shows the solid craftsmanship typical of British products, but no particularly noteworthy high-reliability track record has been confirmed.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The approach of bass extension in compact enclosures through ATL technology is scientifically rational. The design that avoids bass reflex ports enables near-wall placement, showing a practical design philosophy that deserves recognition. The application of studio monitor technology to home audio also has theoretical basis. However, differentiation from performance levels achievable through combinations of general-purpose PC equipment and generic devices at similar price points is insufficient. There is a lack of clear justification for the necessity of existing as dedicated audio equipment, raising questions about the legitimacy of high-priced sales.

## Advice

The PMC Prodigy5 is a product that achieves rational bass reproduction through ATL technology at a price of 2,933 USD. As a floorstanding speaker of similar size and performance available domestically, it falls within the standard price range, and the design philosophy applying PMC's studio monitor technology to home use is commendable. However, the sensitivity of 87.3dB is somewhat low, requiring high-output amplifiers for loud playback. If you can utilize the advantages of ATL design that allows near-wall placement, there is sufficient purchase value. Auditioning for sound quality confirmation is recommended.
