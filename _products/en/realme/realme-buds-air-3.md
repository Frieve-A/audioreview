## Overview

The realme Buds Air 3 is a True Wireless Stereo earphone developed by Chinese smartphone manufacturer realme. It is an ANC-equipped product featuring 42dB active noise cancellation, 10mm LCP drivers, and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity. realme was established in 2018 as a subsidiary of OPPO, developing smartphones and accessories with an emphasis on cost-performance. The company's audio products are based on a price-focused design philosophy, and the Buds Air 3 follows this approach. Note that the official retail price in the Japanese market has not been confirmed at this time.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The biggest problem with this product is that important technical specifications are not disclosed. The manufacturer does not provide measurement data necessary for audio quality evaluation, including frequency response, THD (Total Harmonic Distortion), SNR, and dynamic range. Even the claimed 42dB ANC performance lacks clear measurement conditions and frequency characteristics, making scientific verification impossible. While basic specifications such as 10mm LCP drivers, Bluetooth 5.2, and AAC/SBC codec support can be confirmed, these alone cannot evaluate auditory transparency. The 88ms low latency in gaming mode is irrelevant to music listening but can be evaluated as an improvement for gaming use. However, overall, the lack of measurement data makes scientific validity evaluation difficult.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

From a technical perspective, this represents a standard configuration for its price range. The 10mm LCP (Liquid Crystal Polymer) driver is a lightweight and rigid material, making it an appropriate choice. Bluetooth 5.2 chip and AAC/SBC codec support represent current standard levels, but it does not support high-quality codecs like aptX or LDAC. The 42dB ANC function is competitive for its price range, but technical details are unclear, making implementation level evaluation difficult. Dolby Atmos support is through software processing and does not represent hardware-level technical improvement. Overall, while rational technical choices under cost constraints are evident, technical innovation or advancement is not recognized.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The realme Buds Air 3 lacks confirmed accurate pricing information for the Japanese market. For reference, it is sold in the Indian market for 3,999 rupees (approximately 7,200 yen equivalent). As a competing product with equivalent or superior functions (ANC, 10mm+ drivers, 30+ hours battery life, IPX5+ water resistance), the QCY MeloBuds Pro (6,980 yen) can be cited. This product offers 40dB ANC, 13mm drivers, 34 hours battery life, IPX5 water resistance, and LDAC support, providing equivalent or superior basic performance to the realme Buds Air 3. If the realme Buds Air 3 were sold for around 7,200 yen, the cost-performance calculation would be: 6,980 yen รท 7,200 yen = 0.969, which rounds to 1.0. The realme Buds Air 3 represents the most cost-effective option among equivalent-function products in this evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

realme's product support is built around a system centered on smartphone business. In Japan, a one-year product warranty is provided through authorized distributors, establishing a basic support system. However, user reviews report quality issues such as volume balance problems and connection failures after about 2 months, raising questions about long-term reliability. Firmware updates are provided through the realme Link app, but clear information about update frequency and support duration is unavailable. Regarding repair systems, due to the nature of earphones as a product, they tend to basically offer replacement support. While this represents industry-average support levels, improvements in quality control are needed.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The realme Buds Air 3's design philosophy contains a mixture of rationality and irrationality. Rational aspects include ANC function implementation, practical battery life (30 hours), and securing IPX5 water resistance. Additionally, stable connectivity through Bluetooth 5.2 and multipoint connection support are practical. However, irrational aspects include the non-disclosure of important acoustic measurement data. This makes actual audio quality performance unverifiable and the direction of scientifically-based audio quality improvement unclear. While customization functions through a dedicated app are provided, their effectiveness cannot be verified when basic acoustic characteristics are unknown. While a cost-performance-focused attitude is understandable, the design philosophy's rationality is questionable due to the lack of transparency in basic technical specifications.

## Advice

The realme Buds Air 3, as a product equipped with 42dB ANC function, could be an option for users who want to try ANC-equipped TWS for the first time. Particularly, realme smartphone users would benefit from Dolby Atmos support and app integration. However, it cannot be recommended for users who prioritize audio quality. This is because the manufacturer does not disclose basic acoustic measurement data, making actual audio quality performance unclear. Additionally, since Japanese market pricing is not confirmed, evaluation from a cost-performance perspective is also difficult. For more reliable alternatives, we recommend considering products like QCY MeloBuds Pro (6,980 yen) or Sony WF-C710N (current market price approximately 18,000 yen), which have disclosed measurement data and proven track records. For those planning long-term use, considering quality control reports, careful operation verification within the warranty period is necessary. If budget allows, choosing more reliable products like the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC in the 10,000 yen range would be wise.
