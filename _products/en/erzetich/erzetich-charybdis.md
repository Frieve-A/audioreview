## Overview

The Erzetich Charybdis represents a premium open-back planar magnetic headphone designed by Slovenian audio manufacturer Erzetich Audio. Founded in 2012 by Blaž Erzetič, the company operates as a boutique manufacturer emphasizing handcrafted production in small series. The Charybdis distinguishes itself through exceptionally large 105mm × 115mm planar magnetic drivers—the largest available in the headphone market—paired with CNC-milled aluminum construction and carbon fiber headband. Priced at 3,200 USD, these headphones target mature audiophiles seeking premium craftsmanship and unique design approach. The company's Slovenian heritage influences material choices, including aged linden wood elements and emphasis on sustainability through completely serviceable design architecture.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Frequency response extends to 20Hz with approximately 3dB sub-bass roll-off. Impedance measures 43Ω with sensitivity around 105 dB/mW, providing adequate efficiency for various amplification sources. THD measurements show typical range of 0.1-0.5% with problematic peaks reaching 2% in bass frequencies and 0.4% in treble regions [1]. According to measurement criteria for headphones, THD below 0.05% represents excellent performance while 0.5% or above indicates problematic levels. The Charybdis falls at the borderline between these thresholds. Transient response demonstrates good performance with 15dB decay within 160ms at 84dB input levels, indicating fast driver control. However, measurement data originates primarily from subjective reviews rather than rigorous third-party testing facilities, requiring conservative evaluation due to potential measurement uncertainty and limited verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Implementation features proprietary 105mm × 115mm planar magnetic drivers utilizing double-sided magnet structure in push-pull configuration. Construction employs CNC-milled aluminum cups with carbon fiber headband, representing advanced material integration and in-house design capabilities. EU-based manufacturing demonstrates high accumulation of craftsmanship know-how with handcrafted production quality control. The completely serviceable design architecture provides technical sophistication in repairability and component replacement. However, the decision to pursue maximum driver size contradicts current industry trends toward smaller, more controlled planar magnetic designs. Leading manufacturers like HiFiMan and Audeze have moved toward reduced driver dimensions for improved control and transient response, making this approach potentially undesirable for industry adoption.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Current market price stands at 3,200 USD. The HiFiMan HE400se (115 USD) provides equivalent user-facing functionality with 20Hz-20kHz frequency response, 25Ω impedance, 91dB sensitivity, and open-back design for music listening [5]. Third-party measurement data comparison: HE400se frequency response 20Hz-20kHz equals or exceeds Charybdis's 20Hz extension, impedance 25Ω (measured 26.5Ω) equals or exceeds Charybdis's 43Ω, THD 0.06% at 94dB SPL and 0.11% at 104dB SPL exceeds Charybdis's typical 0.1-0.5% range (with 2% bass peaks and 0.4% treble peaks), confirming equal or superior performance across all measured parameters [6]. The HE400se delivers comparable or superior basic functionality at significantly lower cost. Cost-performance calculation: CP = 115 USD ÷ 3,200 USD = 0.035, rounded to 0.0. The existence of functional equivalence at dramatically lower pricing demonstrates poor cost-performance positioning for the Charybdis despite its premium craftsmanship and unique aesthetic approach.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Two-year limited warranty covers manufacturing and parts defects, meeting industry standard coverage periods. Completely serviceable design philosophy enables component replacement and repair, enhancing long-term reliability prospects. High-quality materials including CNC-milled aluminum and carbon fiber construction resist degradation compared to plastic alternatives. Direct manufacturer support provides proactive communication with clearly defined repair cost structure and quick turnaround when parts remain available. EU manufacturing enables controlled quality processes and established workshop-based repair capabilities in Slovenia. Global shipping includes insurance and tracking with complimentary delivery typically within one week in Europe or 2-3 weeks internationally. The boutique manufacturer scale may limit global support infrastructure compared to larger corporations, though direct contact availability (email and phone) maintains responsive service accessibility.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Company philosophy demonstrates concerning anti-scientific approaches prioritizing subjectivity over measurement-based optimization. Founder explicitly states units are "tuned by ear first" before instrumental verification, representing subjective-first methodology contrary to scientific audio development. The organization's stated goal to "create products for people, not measuring instruments" reflects explicit rejection of measurement-focused design approaches. Company philosophy treats "technology as secondary (or sometimes fun) matter" while emphasizing individual sound signatures, devaluing technical advancement as mere entertainment rather than performance improvement tool. The decision to utilize largest possible drivers lacks scientific rationale for improved measurable performance and contradicts industry movement toward smaller, more controlled designs. While sustainability focus through serviceable design provides positive environmental impact, the overall development direction emphasizes nostalgia, subjectivity, and anti-measurement philosophies contrary to rational scientific audio engineering principles.

## Advice

The Charybdis appeals to audiophiles seeking unique boutique craftsmanship and distinctive aesthetic approach from European manufacturer. The completely serviceable design provides long-term value through repairability, while premium materials ensure construction durability. However, potential purchasers should understand this represents subjective-tuned product rather than measurement-optimized performance. Those prioritizing scientifically verified performance improvements should investigate alternatives with rigorous third-party measurement validation. The 43Ω impedance and 105 dB/mW sensitivity accommodate most amplification sources without extreme power requirements. Consider the 740-gram weight for extended listening comfort preferences. The company's anti-measurement philosophy may not align with listeners seeking transparent, reference-standard reproduction. For buyers appreciating handcrafted European manufacturing and unique largest-driver approach, the Charybdis provides distinctive option unavailable elsewhere in the market at this performance level.
