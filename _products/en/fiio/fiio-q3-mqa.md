## Overview

The FiiO Q3 MQA is a portable DAC/headphone amplifier released in 2022 by FiiO, a veteran Chinese audio manufacturer. It incorporates an XMOS XU316 chip and an AKM AK4452 DAC, achieving low distortion and high output through THX AAA technology. It features MQA full decode capability, 2.5mm/4.4mm balanced outputs, and a 3.5mm single-ended output. The 1800mAh battery enables long-duration operation, designed to improve sound quality in portable audio environments. It is available in the Japanese market at approximately 24,200 JPY.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Q3 MQA's measurement performance is excellent. A THD+N of 0.0015% (1kHz, USB input, balanced output) is significantly below the transparent level of 0.01%, and the S/N ratio of over 113dB exceeds the transparent level of 105dB. The frequency response covers 20Hz-65kHz, ensuring flatness in the audible range. The balanced output power of 330mW (32Ω) can adequately drive most headphones, and measured distortion rates are well below auditory thresholds. These measurement results demonstrate objective sound quality improvement effects, earning a high evaluation for scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 16-core XMOS XU316 processor is a latest-generation USB controller with processing capability for PCM 384kHz/32bit and DSD256. The THX AAA-28 amplifier module is established as an industry-standard low-distortion amplification technology. The AK4452 DAC chip is a mid-grade product from Asahi Kasei, selected as a response to supply shortages from factory fires. While MQA full decode functionality is implemented, technical uniqueness is limited. Overall, it represents a solid design but remains at an average level in terms of adopting cutting-edge industry technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Considering the combination of features the Q3 MQA offers—a built-in battery, high output power exceeding 300mW via its THX AAA amplifier, and MQA full decode capability—its price of 24,200 JPY is highly competitive. It is difficult to find an alternative product in the current market that offers equivalent or superior features and performance at a lower price. As this product is effectively one of the most affordable options in its feature and performance class, its cost-performance is rated at a perfect 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

FiiO is a Chinese manufacturer established in 2007 with over 15 years of experience in the portable audio sector. Products come with a standard manufacturer's warranty, and sales and support systems are established through authorized domestic distributors. The company's product failure rates are at industry-average levels, with no notable quality issues reported. Firmware update support is also provided appropriately. However, its long-term reliability track record and the comprehensiveness of its support are at a standard level compared to premium brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Q3 MQA's design philosophy takes a measurement performance-focused approach, which is scientifically rational. The pursuit of low distortion through THX AAA technology, signal quality improvement via balanced outputs, and ensuring adequate output power all contribute to better sound quality. MQA support, while controversial, provides practical value for users of streaming services like Tidal. The design, specialized for portable use, matches market needs, and its pricing is rational. The direction of technology investment can be evaluated as an appropriate approach toward achieving transparent-level sound quality.

## Advice

The Q3 MQA is a portable DAC/amp with extremely high measurement performance and cost-performance. For users who frequently listen to MQA content and value the convenience of battery operation and high output power, it is arguably the most rational choice on the market today. The 330mW output is particularly effective when paired with power-hungry planar magnetic headphones, allowing users to fully experience the benefits of the THX AAA technology. If you are looking for the best performance in this price range, this product is highly recommended.
