## Overview

The FiiO M11 Plus ESS represents FiiO's mid-range Android-based digital audio player featuring dual ES9068AS DAC chips and THX AAA-78 amplification. Originally released as an updated version of the M11 Plus with ESS Sabre DACs replacing the previous AKM implementation, this device targets users seeking high-resolution portable audio playback with full Android functionality. The CNC machined aluminum alloy construction and 6th-generation honeycomb design provide a premium feel while maintaining practical portability with a 5.5-inch bezel-less display and 6000mAh battery capacity.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The M11 Plus ESS demonstrates excellent measured performance across key audio quality specifications. S/N ratio reaches ≥126dB (manufacturer spec), significantly exceeding the transparent level of 105dB [1]. THD+N measures ≤0.00054% (1kHz/32Ω), well below the transparent threshold of 0.01% [1]. Frequency response spans 20Hz-20kHz (-1dB), achieving better than transparent-level performance (±0.5dB) [1]. Output power reaches 660mW at 32Ω through the 4.4mm balanced output and 210mW through 3.5mm single-ended [1]. All specifications exceed transparent levels according to measurement criteria, indicating world-class audio performance. Conservative evaluation adjustment applied due to reliance primarily on manufacturer specifications without independent third-party verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

FiiO demonstrates sophisticated in-house design with proprietary 4th generation FPGA controller and modular circuit architecture [2]. The implementation features advanced technical elements including NDK femtosecond crystal oscillators, phase-locked loop technology, and completely separated analog/digital modules with individual shielding [2]. Dual ES9068AS DAC chips utilize FiiO's Digital Audio Purification System (DAPS) with carefully tuned performance achieving low distortion [2]. THX AAA-78 amplification modules employ feed-forward error correction technology for neutral sound reproduction [2]. The design integrates contemporary digital processing through Android 10 OS, Snapdragon 660 processor with appropriate circuit design and software integration, representing meaningful technological advancement in portable audio. While the ES9068AS represents a capable mid-range DAC implementation rather than the cutting-edge flagship chips used in higher-tier models, the overall technical sophistication through FPGA processing, DAPS implementation, and integrated architecture demonstrates solid engineering achievement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Current market price: 730 USD. The iBasso DX170 serves as the primary comparison target, offering equivalent-or-better user-facing functionality at 449 USD [3]. The DX170 provides Android OS, Wi-Fi streaming, microSD expansion, 3.5mm and 4.4mm balanced outputs, and manufacturer-published measured performance equal-or-better including THD+N 0.00022% (balanced) and SNR 130dB [3]. Equipped with equivalent connectivity options (3.5mm SE, 4.4mm balanced, Bluetooth, WiFi), Android OS functionality, and high-resolution audio support, the DX170 demonstrates equivalent-or-better performance across all user-facing functions and specifications. CP = 449 USD ÷ 730 USD = 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

FiiO provides standard 1-year limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship from original purchase date [4]. Global manufacturer support infrastructure includes direct manufacturer response for technical issues and warranty claims [4]. The company maintains established reputation for digital audio products with consistent support through multiple channels including local dealers and direct manufacturer contact [4]. Support covers one-month replacement guarantee followed by one-year free maintenance, with FiiO covering return shipping costs for warranted repairs [4]. Construction utilizes robust design with digital components and solid-state implementation inherently resistant to degradation compared to mechanical or analog alternatives.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

FiiO demonstrates measurement-focused engineering approach emphasizing objective performance data rather than subjective marketing claims [5]. The design philosophy prioritizes scientifically validated audio performance through proven digital solutions and contemporary component integration [5]. Product costs directly contribute to functional improvements including advanced DACs, amplification circuits, and processing power rather than meaningless aesthetic elements [5]. The company adopts rational choices for achieving transparent-level sound quality while avoiding unsubstantiated audio myths [5]. Technology adoption focuses on contemporary digital integration through Android OS, advanced DAC implementation, FPGA processing, and software integration rather than pursuing questionable analog approaches. Design progression demonstrates commitment to measurable improvements in audio performance specifications while maintaining cost-effective implementation relative to contemporary alternatives at the time of release.

## Advice

The FiiO M11 Plus ESS provides transparent-level audio performance suitable for users requiring high-quality portable music playback with full Android functionality. The device serves users who prioritize measured audio performance and appreciate comprehensive connectivity options including balanced outputs and wireless protocols. However, the iBasso DX170 offers equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance at significantly lower cost (449 USD vs 730 USD), making it the more cost-effective choice for most users. The M11 Plus ESS remains viable for users specifically preferring ESS Sabre DAC character or requiring immediate availability where alternatives are unavailable. Android 10 provides full app ecosystem access including streaming services, making this suitable for users preferring unified device functionality over dedicated audio-only players.
