## Overview

The FiiO BTR15 is a portable DAC/headphone amplifier with Bluetooth 5.1 support. It features dual ES9219MQ chips and supports high-quality codecs including LDAC, aptX HD, and aptX Adaptive. The device provides both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs, delivering up to 340mW (32Ω, balanced) of power. As the successor to the company's BTR5, it offers a more refined design and improved technical specifications. FiiO is a China-based manufacturer of portable audio equipment with a diverse product lineup developed over many years.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measurement performance is exceptionally excellent. THD+N is below 0.0008% (1kHz/32kΩ), significantly lower than the transparent level of 0.01%. The S/N ratio exceeds 122dB (A-weighted), greatly surpassing the transparent level of 105dB, making background noise virtually inaudible. The frequency response of 20Hz-50kHz (-0.8dB) is nearly within the transparent level of ±0.5dB in the audible range. The noise floor is extremely low at under 2µV for single-ended output and under 2.7µV for balanced output, with output impedance also ideal at under 1Ω (single-ended) and under 1.5Ω (balanced). These measured values indicate that scientifically meaningful transparency in faithful source reproduction is achieved.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The adoption of dual ES9219MQ DAC chips aims to improve L/R channel separation and performance. The Bluetooth 5.1 implementation contributes to stability and connection quality, while comprehensive codec support for LDAC, aptX HD, and aptX Adaptive is technically appropriate. The 340mW (32Ω) output in balanced mode provides sufficient design margin for a device of this size. However, the ES9219MQ used is an established technology, representing a solid implementation of proven tech rather than an innovative proprietary design. With limited detailed technical information on the circuit design and amplifier section, it exceeds industry standards but does not reach the pinnacle of technical achievement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The FiiO BTR15 has a market price of 109 USD. We compare this to products with equivalent or superior functionality (high-quality Bluetooth codecs, balanced output) and measurement performance. One of the most affordable alternatives in the current market is the Shanling UP4 2022 (market price approx. 99 USD).
Cost-performance is calculated by dividing the price of the comparison product by the price of the product under review.

`99 USD ÷ 109 USD ≒ 0.91`

Based on this calculation, the score is 0.9. Although a cheaper alternative exists, the price difference is small, and the BTR15 still maintains high cost-performance when considering the balance of features and performance. USB-only products (e.g., Moondrop Dawn Pro, approx. 60 USD) are even cheaper but are not direct comparisons as they lack the convenience of Bluetooth functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

FiiO is a well-known manufacturer with a global presence, offering support through official distributors in various regions. The product warranty is a standard one year. The company appropriately handles firmware updates, with a track record of providing updates for previous BTR series models. However, support services remain at the industry average level. Official data on initial defect rates or long-term failure rates is limited. While individual reviews are generally positive, statistical reliability data is unavailable. It can be assessed as providing an industry-standard level of support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The basic design as a Bluetooth DAC/amplifier is extremely rational. Features that prioritize practicality, such as support for multiple high-quality codecs, provision of both balanced and single-ended outputs, and concurrent USB DAC functionality, scientifically contribute to sound quality. The dual-DAC configuration for stereo separation is also a theoretically sound approach. Pairing the device with a smartphone is a rational choice that prioritizes measurable performance improvements. However, the product's existence relies mainly on convenience and portability, and the design lacks groundbreaking innovation. Overall, it is a product with a rational design philosophy aimed at achieving transparent-level sound quality.

## Advice

The FiiO BTR15 is a recommended product that combines transparent-level audio quality with excellent functionality. At a price of 109 USD, its cost-performance is still favorable, even with competitors like the Shanling UP4 2022 (approx. 99 USD) on the market. The convenience offered by Bluetooth is a significant value over USB-only DACs, making the BTR15 one of the most rational choices for users seeking high-quality wireless audio playback. Considering FiiO's stable support system and track record, it is a product you can purchase with confidence. Since absolute differences in sound quality are at a level that is difficult to discern by ear, we recommend making a choice based on the balance of functionality, convenience, and price.
