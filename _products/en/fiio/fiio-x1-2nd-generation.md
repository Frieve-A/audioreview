## Overview

The FiiO X1 2nd Generation is an entry-level digital audio player featuring hi-res audio support up to 192kHz/32-bit WAV and 192kHz/24-bit FLAC. This updated version incorporates a Texas Instruments PCM5422 DAC (upgraded from PCM5142), dual 3.5mm outputs for headphone and line connections, and basic Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity. Housed in an aluminum body with a 2-inch TFT display, the device targets budget-conscious users seeking portable hi-res audio playback without premium features like balanced outputs or advanced wireless codecs.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Audio performance evaluation relies primarily on manufacturer specifications due to limited credible third-party measurement data. Manufacturer specifications indicate SNR ≥115dBA (line)/≥113dBA (headphone), exceeding the 105dB transparent threshold [1]. Line output THD+N ≤0.003% (1kHz) falls well below the 0.01% transparent level [1]. Dynamic range ≥107dB approaches the 105dB transparent benchmark [1]. Frequency response spans 5Hz to 60kHz, exceeding audible range requirements [1]. While Audio Science Review forum references measurement data for the X1-ii, detailed third-party verification of manufacturer claims remains limited [2]. Conservative evaluation reflects reliance on manufacturer-provided specifications rather than independently verified measurements, with performance indicators suggesting capabilities near transparent levels across key parameters.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The X1 2nd generation employs proven contemporary components without significant innovation. The TI PCM5422 DAC represents an incremental upgrade from the previous PCM5142, offering differential line output and marginally improved specifications. Amplification stage uses standard Intersil ISL28291 buffer with TI OPA2322 opamp configuration. System architecture features Ingenic JZ4760B SoC with Linux-based operating system. While competently executed, the implementation lacks proprietary technology, cutting-edge features, or meaningful differentiation from competing products. Component selection follows conservative industry-standard approaches rather than advancing technical capabilities.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The FiiO X1 2nd Generation is currently priced at USD 99.99. A search was conducted for lower-priced products with confirmed equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance. Budget hi-res players such as the RUIZU 64GB HiFi Lossless MP3 Player (approximately USD 50) support hi-res formats but lack published measured performance data (SNR, THD+N, dynamic range), making it impossible to confirm equivalent-or-better performance [3]. Products with confirmed superior measured performance, such as those equipped with dual ESS DACs and balanced outputs, are priced significantly above the X1. No lower-priced product with confirmed equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance exists in the current market; therefore CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

FiiO provides standard industry support with one-year warranty coverage and established global service infrastructure. The company demonstrates commitment to customer service even for products purchased through unauthorized channels. Founded in 2007, FiiO has established a reliable track record in portable audio products. The X1's aluminum construction and simple design minimize failure-prone components. However, warranty period remains at industry average, and no exceptional support features distinguish the service offering from competitors. Repair services require shipping to manufacturer with two-way freight coverage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

FiiO demonstrates a generally rational, measurement-focused approach to audio design with transparent technical specifications and scientific methodology. The company emphasizes proven components over exotic implementations, contributing to reliable performance and reasonable pricing. Clear progression from 1st to 2nd generation shows commitment to incremental improvements based on measurable parameters. However, marketing claims regarding "All To DSD" conversion benefits completely lack scientific substantiation and represent pseudoscientific audio mythology without credible evidence of audible improvements. This undermines an otherwise measurement-driven approach. The overall design philosophy prioritizes cost-effectiveness and practical functionality while maintaining measurement-driven development, though such unsubstantiated promotional messaging damages complete scientific credibility.

## Advice

The FiiO X1 2nd Generation serves users seeking entry into hi-res audio with established brand reliability and comprehensive format support. Its manufacturer-specified performance credentials make it suitable for users upgrading from smartphone audio or basic MP3 players. The dual 3.5mm outputs provide useful flexibility for different headphone impedances and line connections. While cheaper hi-res players exist, their measured performance is unconfirmed, making audio quality equivalence uncertain. Users requiring advanced features like balanced outputs, premium wireless codecs, or cutting-edge DAC implementations should consider higher-tier alternatives.
