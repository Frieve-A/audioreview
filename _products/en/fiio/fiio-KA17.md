## Overview

The FiiO KA17 is a portable DAC/headphone amplifier released in 2024. Combining dual ES9069Q DAC chips with THX AAA 78+ amplifier technology, it achieves desktop-level audio performance in a compact form factor. It features both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs, supporting high-resolution playback up to PCM 768kHz/32bit and DSD 512. The KA17 represents FiiO's flagship portable DAC product, showcasing the company's accumulated technical expertise.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The KA17 achieves transparent levels across most measurement criteria. THD+N below 0.0015% surpasses the transparent level of 0.01%, while the S/N ratio of 123dB (A-weighted) significantly exceeds the transparent level of 105dB. Frequency response achieves 20Hz-20kHz ±0.1dB or better, and crosstalk exceeds 80dB, which is excellent. Dynamic range of 130dB also comfortably clears the transparent level, delivering measurement performance that contributes to audibly meaningful sound quality improvements. Output impedance below 1Ω is also ideal.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The adoption of dual ES9069Q DAC chips is technically advanced. The 4th generation 32bit HyperStream technology achieves both improved performance and reduced power consumption compared to previous generations. The THX AAA 78+ amplifier technology's 4-channel fully balanced design and 8-channel parallel op-amp configuration represents industry-leading technical approach. The adoption of XMOS 16-core XU316 processor also demonstrates high technical standards. However, points are deducted as the DAC chips themselves are off-the-shelf components rather than fully proprietary designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The KA17 is priced at 20,990 JPY. After comprehensive market research, no competing portable DAC/amp with equivalent or superior measurement performance (THD+N below 0.0015%, S/N ratio of 123dB, and 650mW output) exists at a lower price. The closest competing product is the iBasso DC Elite at 65,249 JPY (verified current retail price). Calculation: 65,249 JPY ÷ 20,990 JPY = 3.11, which exceeds 1.0, resulting in an evaluation of 1.0. While desktop DACs like TOPPING D10s (11,000 JPY) offer excellent measurement specs, they lack the portable form factor, battery/bus power operation, and high-power headphone amplification that define this product category. The KA17 achieves the lowest price among portable products with equivalent functionality and measurement performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

FiiO is a manufacturer with high reliability within the industry. Products come with a 1-year warranty, and with official distributors in Japan, repair support infrastructure is well-established. Firmware updates are supported, allowing for continuous functional improvements. Based on the track record of previous KA series products, failure rates are estimated to be below industry average. However, physical durability specific to portable products requires long-term verification.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The KA17's design philosophy is scientifically highly rational. It technically pursues measurable sound quality improvements directly related to THD+N reduction, S/N ratio improvement, and frequency response flattening. The desktop mode's high power output provides audibly meaningful improvements when driving high-impedance headphones. The 10-band PEQ adjustment function through software signal processing is also a rational approach enabling optimization according to users' auditory characteristics. The justification for existing as dedicated equipment is sufficiently validated by achieving this performance level at around 20,000 JPY.

## Advice

The KA17 is an innovative product that achieves desktop-level measurement performance in the 20,000 JPY portable DAC/amp market. Those considering purchase should first check the impedance of their intended headphones. For high-efficiency headphones of 32Ω or below, normal mode is sufficient, but for high-impedance models of 300Ω or above, the desktop mode's 650mW output will demonstrate its true value. Compared to the competing iBasso DC Elite, there's a price difference of over 44,000 JPY (verified current pricing), yet measurement performance achieves comparable levels, making this the optimal choice for those prioritizing cost-performance. However, for portable use, attention to heat generation and battery consumption is necessary, and stable power supply is recommended when using desktop mode.
