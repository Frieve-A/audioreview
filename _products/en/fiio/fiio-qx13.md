## Overview

The FiiO QX13 is a portable DAC/headphone amplifier released in 2025. It employs the ESS SABRE PRO ES9027PRO, features up to 21-layer carbon fiber construction, a 1.99-inch IPS display, and a 10-band PEQ [1]. In desktop mode, it delivers up to 900mW+900mW (32Ω) via 4.4mm balanced output and supports native 768kHz/32bit PCM and DSD512, as well as full MQA decoding [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

At this time, comprehensive third-party measurements (e.g., SINAD, system THD+N) are limited or unavailable. Manufacturer specs include 900mW+900mW (32Ω, 4.4mm balanced, desktop mode) output and support for PCM 768kHz/32bit, DSD512, and full MQA decoding [1][2]. These indicate potential for transparency, but without independent data confirming audibility, we assign a provisional score [1][2]. We will revise when credible third-party measurements become available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

With ES9027PRO, XMOS XU316 (dual femtosecond clocks), and TI INA1620×4 + OPA1692×2 amplification, the implementation is advanced for a portable device [1][2]. The 21-layer carbon fiber chassis (rigidity/EMI attention), desktop mode high output, and 10-band PEQ further underscore a forward-looking design [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price: 219 USD (global) / 1399–1499 CNY (China) [2][3][4]. We found no cheaper product offering the same user-facing functions (1.99-inch display, 10-band PEQ, desktop mode, 4.4mm balanced output with high power) with equal-or-better core performance at a lower market price [1][2][3][4][5]. Therefore, with no cheaper equivalent-or-better option identified, CP is set to 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

FiiO is an established portable audio brand with global presence and standard warranty support [1]. However, as a new model with complex features (display, PEQ, desktop mode), long-term field data is still accumulating. We rate slightly above average overall.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Investment is focused on verifiable capabilities (output power, PCM/DSD support, PEQ, power design, EMI attention) rather than unscientific claims [1][2]. Desktop mode and PEQ, in particular, rationally expand usability and optimization within the audible range.

## Advice

Best suited for users who need high output and value the display, PEQ, and desktop mode. The light yet rigid chassis and high power enable near desktop-grade drive on the go [1][2]. If you do not need a display/PEQ and prefer ultra-compact dongles, cheaper options exist. Independent measurements will further solidify purchase confidence once available.
