## Overview

FiiO’s FT1 Pro is an open-back planar headphone using a **95×86mm** in-house driver and a **1µm** PET diaphragm with **sapphire+aluminum dual coating**. Specs: **20Ω / 95 dB/mW (112 dB/Vrms)**, **~374 g**, dual 3.5mm TS connectors. It ships with 3.5mm and 4.4mm cables and a carry bag. US street price at review time is **199 USD**. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third-party data shows **~0.1% THD at 94 dB SPL** with higher distortion at **104/110 dB**; at the extreme bass it is **excursion-limited around 98–100 dB**, so heavy bass EQ at high volumes reduces headroom. Sensitivity (**95 dB/mW**) and impedance (**20Ω**) match published values. Frequency response is broadly neutral with small upper-band variations across units. [3][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Engineering highlights include the **1µm diaphragm**, **dual-coating**, **uniform magnetic field design (patented)**, and **28 nm-grade coating process**. The **374 g** chassis with **steel sliders** and a **12-step headband** is practical and robust. There’s no DSP/active correction; the implementation is conventional but well-executed. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comparator: **HiFiMAN HE400SE (109 USD)**. **Equivalence note**: open-back planar design, **very low distortion**, and **neutral-leaning FR**, yielding equal-or-better user-facing functions and measured performance. [5][6]

**109 USD ÷ 199 USD = 0.548 → CP 0.5 (rounded to one decimal).**  
This places the FT1 Pro at a moderate CP versus the current least-cost equivalent option. [5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

FiiO lists **one-month replacement / one-year free maintenance** as standard. Construction is simple with **steel sliders** and a sturdy headband. Long-term field data are limited for this model family, so overall reliability/support is assessed as average. [1][8]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Targeting neutral reproduction with measurable, materials- and magnetics-driven improvements is scientifically rational. The design avoids claims of unmeasurable effects. Early reports of low-frequency resonance/clip behavior reflect trade-offs in maximum output, but the overall direction aligns with fidelity-first goals. [2][3][4]

## Advice

If you want a neutral-leaning planar around **199 USD**, the FT1 Pro is compelling. If **minimum cost for equivalent function/performance** matters most, **HE400SE (109 USD)** remains the value pick. For more output headroom and a larger stage, consider **Edition XS (239 USD)**. [5][6][7]
