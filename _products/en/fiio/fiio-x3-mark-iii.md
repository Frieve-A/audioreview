## Overview

The FiiO X3 Mark III represents the Chinese manufacturer's third-generation portable digital audio player, introduced in 2017 with dual TI PCM5242 DAC chips and both single-ended and balanced output capabilities. This device marked FiiO's first implementation of dual DAC architecture at this price point, featuring a triple PCB design to minimize interference and support high-resolution audio formats up to 192kHz/32-bit PCM and DSD64 [1]. Despite solid engineering for its era, the X3 Mark III has been officially discontinued by FiiO and faces significant technological obsolescence compared to modern alternatives available in 2026.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third-party measurements from Soundphile Review provide the primary evaluation basis [2]. THD+N of 0.002% (single-ended) and 0.003% (balanced) at 1kHz both fall well below the 0.01% transparent threshold, demonstrating excellent distortion performance. Signal-to-noise ratio of 112dB significantly exceeds the 105dB transparent threshold. Frequency response of 5Hz-70kHz (-3dB) substantially exceeds audible requirements. Crosstalk performance shows variation between outputs: single-ended output at 69dB falls just below the 70dB transparent threshold, while balanced output achieves 97dB, clearly meeting transparent requirements [2]. Output impedance of 1.4Ω (single-ended) and 1.2Ω (balanced) provides adequate damping. Output power of 160mW (single-ended) and 190mW (balanced) at 32Ω offers sufficient driving capability for most headphones. Most key metrics clear transparent levels, with single-ended crosstalk as the sole borderline indicator at 69dB versus the 70dB transparent threshold.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The X3 Mark III demonstrates solid engineering implementation with notable design sophistication. The triple PCB architecture separating digital processing, analog amplification, and Bluetooth circuits represents thoughtful interference minimization. The dual PCM5242 DAC implementation for balanced output was the first time FiiO offered this configuration at this price point, demonstrating technological advancement within their product line. Asynchronous USB DAC implementation and proper separation of DAC, low-pass filter, and amplification stages indicate competent analog circuit design. The F1C81 Bluetooth chipset with simultaneous transmit/receive dual-mode functionality was contemporary technology at the 2017 release. However, by 2026 standards, Bluetooth 4.1 has been superseded by newer standards, and overall component selection reflects mid-2010s state-of-the-art rather than current cutting-edge innovation, making the technology stack feel dated. The balanced output implementation and triple PCB approach have since been adopted industry-wide, validating the technical judgment.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Current market analysis identifies the Shanling M0 Pro at 129 USD as the cheapest standalone DAP with published performance specifications exceeding the X3 Mark III across all key audio quality metrics. Equipped with dual ES9219C DACs, the M0 Pro demonstrates superior measured performance: THD+N of 0.0006%/0.0004% (SE/balanced) versus 0.002%/0.003%, SNR of 118dB/119dB versus 112dB, channel separation of 72dB/109dB versus 69dB/97dB, and output impedance of 0.4/0.8 ohm versus 1.4/1.2 ohm (M0 Pro: manufacturer specifications [3]; X3 Mark III: third-party measurements [2]). Balanced output power is superior at 236mW versus 190mW at 32 ohm, though single-ended output power is lower at 90mW versus 160mW, which remains sufficient for portable headphone use. The M0 Pro provides equivalent core DAP functions: standalone operation, battery power (14.5 hours), display, microSD (up to 2TB), USB DAC mode, Bluetooth 5.0 with LDAC (superior to X3 Mark III's Bluetooth 4.1), and DSD128 support (superior to DSD64). The M0 Pro's balanced output uses a proprietary 5-pin 3.5mm connector requiring a 16 USD adapter for standard 4.4mm balanced connections [4]. The M0 Pro lacks the X3 Mark III's coaxial digital output, a supplementary connectivity feature not commonly available on competing portable DAPs at this price range. The X3 Mark III's current market price is 199 USD. CP = 145 USD ÷ 199 USD = 0.73, rounded to 0.7.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

FiiO provides one-year warranty coverage, falling below the industry standard two-year coverage [6]. The company operates primarily with dealer-based support, with noted limitations for international warranty coverage on online purchases. The X3 Mark III features simple solid-state construction with minimal moving parts except the scroll wheel, providing inherent reliability advantages. However, as a discontinued product in 2026, ongoing firmware updates and active manufacturer support are no longer available. FiiO maintains a dedicated FAQ page for the X3 Mark III, but repair and parts availability for this legacy product is increasingly limited. The below-average warranty terms and discontinued product status reduce the evaluation, partially offset by the inherently robust solid-state construction.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The X3 Mark III embodies rational audio engineering with focus on measurable performance improvements. The triple PCB separation addresses genuine electromagnetic interference concerns through engineering solutions rather than marketing claims. The dual DAC implementation for balanced output provides substantial benefits in noise rejection and crosstalk reduction, justifying the additional complexity and cost. The device avoids unscientific audio myths, focusing on contemporary digital solutions including PCM5242 DAC and asynchronous USB implementation. Engineering costs contribute directly to functional improvements, with no evidence of meaningless material investment or occult approaches. The design philosophy emphasizes objective performance indicators with published specifications supporting measurement-driven development. Format support prioritizes practical utility with comprehensive codec compatibility rather than pursuing analog nostalgia or unfounded approaches. Advanced functional integration appropriate for portable use includes Bluetooth connectivity, USB DAC functionality, and local playback with integrated design featuring proper battery optimization. Rational evolution from previous X3 models demonstrates measurement performance improvements and feature additions based on user needs rather than subjective audiophile trends.

## Advice

The FiiO X3 Mark III represents solid engineering achievement from 2017 but faces significant challenges in current market conditions. Potential buyers should primarily consider this player as historical reference or budget option if available at substantial price reductions. The measured performance maintains competent capability with excellent S/N ratio, dynamic range, and frequency response specifications meeting transparent audio requirements. However, current alternatives provide excellent specifications at lower cost, making new purchase justification difficult. Existing owners benefit from proven balanced output implementation and comprehensive format support, suitable for continued use until hardware failure or changing functional requirements. The discontinued status eliminates firmware update possibilities and limits future support availability. For new DAP purchases, contemporary alternatives offer equivalent or superior measured performance, extended warranty terms, and active manufacturer support at comparable or lower prices. The X3 Mark III's rational design philosophy and engineering competence deserve recognition, but market evolution has displaced it with newer options offering excellent cost-performance ratios.
