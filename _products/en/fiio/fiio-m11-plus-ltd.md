## Overview

The FiiO M11 Plus LTD is a premium Android-based digital audio player that was produced as a limited edition run featuring dual out-of-production AK4497EQ DAC chipsets and THX AAA-78 amplification technology. Released around 2021-2022, this discontinued limited edition model sat below the then-flagship M15 and served as an upper-tier M11-series DAP, while still offering comprehensive connectivity including 3.5mm single-ended, 2.5mm balanced, and 4.4mm balanced outputs [14]. Approximately 5,000 units were produced before discontinuation due to component availability issues, particularly the AKM factory fire and subsequent discontinuation of AK4497EQ DAC chips. The device runs Android 10 on a Snapdragon 660 processor with 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and supports high-resolution audio up to DSD256 and 384kHz/32-bit PCM. Key features include USB DAC functionality, Bluetooth receiver capability, a large 6000mAh battery with fast charging, and a 5.5-inch touchscreen display. Any remaining units available are existing retail stock, as no new production is occurring.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The M11 Plus LTD demonstrates excellent measured performance across key audio quality indicators based on manufacturer specifications. THD+N measurements are exceptional with <0.0006% for single-ended and <0.00146% for balanced outputs (1kHz/32Ω), well below the 0.01% transparent level. SNR measurements of ≥120dB (SE) and ≥120.5dB (balanced) significantly exceed the 105dB transparent threshold [4]. The dual AK4497EQ DACs specify 128dB SNR and -116dB THD, indicating excellent underlying performance capabilities [5]. Frequency response is specified as 5Hz to 90kHz (-5dB) for line out and balanced line out [4]. Output power specifications of ≥295mW (16Ω SE) and ≥500mW (16Ω balanced) provide adequate drive capability for most headphones. However, these evaluations rely entirely on manufacturer specifications rather than independent third-party measurements, requiring conservative assessment as claimed values may not reflect actual performance under controlled test conditions.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The M11 Plus LTD showcases significant technical sophistication through its implementation of advanced audio processing technologies. The device employs dual AK4497EQ DAC chipsets, which were flagship components from AKM Semiconductor before becoming out-of-production, demonstrating access to premium components [5]. The fully-balanced THX AAA-78 amplification technology represents cutting-edge amplifier design with feed-forward error correction for minimal distortion [6]. Technical innovation is evident in the custom 4th generation FPGA implementation with Digital Audio Purification System (DAPS) technology, working alongside two Japanese NDK femtosecond crystal oscillators for precision timing and jitter reduction [6]. The modular circuit architecture with individual shielding demonstrates sophisticated interference management [6]. However, by 2026 standards, some technologies like the Snapdragon 660 processor and Android 10 OS represent aging implementations compared to contemporary solutions, limiting forward-looking technology assessment.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The current market price is 649.99 USD (102,766円 converted using the ECB 2026-01-16 rate) [15][16]. The cheapest equivalent-or-better configuration found is the moto g play - 2026 Android smartphone at 179.99 USD plus the FiiO Q15 at 67,913円 (429.55 USD) [1][2][3][16]. The Q15 claims 1610 mW at 32Ω balanced, THD+N <0.00055% (1kHz/-14dB@32Ω), and SNR ≥123dB, exceeding the M11 Plus LTD specs of 588 mW at 32Ω balanced, THD+N <0.00146% (1kHz/32Ω), and SNR ≥120.5dB; all are manufacturer specs with different test conditions [2][4]. With Android app/streaming on the phone and the Q15 providing USB DAC, Bluetooth reception, 3.5mm/4.4mm outputs, line out, and PCM 768kHz/DSD512 support, functionality and performance are equivalent or better [1][2]. The combined price is 609.54 USD, so CP = 609.54 USD ÷ 649.99 USD = 0.94, which rounds to 0.9.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The M11 Plus LTD demonstrates concerning reliability patterns with multiple documented user issues affecting core functionality. Reported problems include digital noise and interference during playback, streaming service compatibility failures with Qobuz, audio playback interruptions, and third-party app compatibility issues including Poweramp audio cut-offs and Roon device recognition failures [7][8][9]. Hardware reliability concerns include documented battery bulging after limited use periods, indicating potential safety and longevity issues [10]. Additional usability problems include excessive heat generation during operation, poor WiFi reception, and accidental volume button activation [11]. FiiO provides standard one-year warranty coverage with comprehensive support resources including detailed FAQ documentation, firmware updates, and active community forum support [12]. However, the frequency and severity of documented reliability issues significantly impact overall assessment despite adequate support infrastructure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

FiiO demonstrates exemplary rational design philosophy emphasizing measurement-focused approach for transparent sound quality achievement. The company follows Bauhaus' rational design concept where styling serves function and experience, prioritizing measurable performance over aesthetic embellishments [13]. Engineering decisions emphasize objective technical specifications with examples like THD+N of <0.0004% and SNR >122dB, demonstrating commitment to transparent measurable performance [14]. Technology adoption focuses on cutting-edge components that deliver measurable performance gains rather than subjective improvements, avoiding occult audio approaches in favor of proven digital solutions and contemporary component integration. Design decisions emphasize measurable transparency through low THD+N specifications, high SNR achievements, adequate output power for real-world applications, and practical usability features. The company philosophy balances innovation with defined vision, often leading markets with new features while maintaining focus on objective performance criteria rather than pursuing marketing-driven extremes. This rational approach aligns with scientific audio engineering principles and demonstrates consistent commitment to measurement-driven product development.

## Advice

The FiiO M11 Plus LTD is no longer in production and available only through remaining retail stock or secondary market. If Android app operation and high output power are required, the moto g play - 2026 plus FiiO Q15 combination provides equivalent or better functionality and performance at lower cost [1][2][3]. Prospective buyers of remaining M11 Plus LTD units should carefully weigh documented reliability issues including digital noise problems, streaming compatibility failures, and potential battery safety concerns against the device's sophisticated audio processing capabilities. The aging Android 10 OS and Snapdragon 660 processor limit long-term software support compared to contemporary DAPs. Given the discontinued status, warranty support may be limited, and replacement parts availability uncertain. Users primarily interested in audio performance may find better value in current-generation dedicated DAPs with active development and regular firmware updates.
