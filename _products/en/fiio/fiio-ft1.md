## Overview

The FiiO FT1 is the company’s first closed-back over-ear headphone, pairing a 60 mm dynamic driver with solid wood ear cups (North American walnut or beech). List price at review time is 149 USD. FiiO specifies a nanowood-fiber composite diaphragm with a W-shaped suspension to increase effective radiating area and a low-impedance 32 Ω motor designed for easy drive. Accessories include both 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm cables plus a carrying case. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent lab data substantiate key claims. RTINGS measures **harmonic distortion** at **0.08 % @ 94 dB SPL** and **0.28 % @ 104 dB SPL**, indicating clean output across the band; **sensitivity** is **115 dB/V @ 1 kHz**, so amplification is unnecessary; and **passive isolation** shows **overall attenuation −12.46 dB** (treble −28.98 dB, mids −12.55 dB). Leakage is **35.45 dB @ 1 ft**. Frequency-response compliance to the lab’s target is rated strong, with good L/R matching and tight group delay. These quantified results support audible transparency in distortion terms, while isolation remains modest for a passive closed-back. [3]  
Manufacturer specs (32 Ω, **113 dB/V**) align closely with the above sensitivity. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

FiiO’s 60 mm nanowood-fiber diaphragm and **W-shaped** suspension are thoughtful engineering choices aimed at damping and efficiency. The conical baffle, U-shaped damping tube, and wood shells target resonance control—techniques known in the category rather than breakthroughs. Execution quality and included balanced cable are notable at this price, but the core topology remains a conventional dynamic driver. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

To judge price-performance, we compare the FT1 (149 USD) with the **cheapest closed-back headphone of equal or better measured performance** we could verify. The **AKG K371** meets or exceeds the FT1 on critical metrics (**THD 0.08 % @ 94 dB; 0.21 % @ 104 dB; isolation overall −13.08 dB; sensitivity 117 dB/V**), and as of this review the **lowest widely available market price** we could confirm is **119.95 USD**. Therefore:

**119.95 USD ÷ 149 USD = 0.805… → CP score 0.8 (rounded to one decimal).**  
Sources: RTINGS (performance) and Klarna price aggregation (15 stores, lowest 119.95 USD). [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Multiple retailers list a 1-year warranty; FiiO provides global support channels. Importantly, FiiO publicly addressed a **headband/hinge screw loosening issue** and states that **batches produced from Nov 20, 2024 onward** use an updated structure “completely resolving” the problem; RTINGS also notes the **revised hinge** on their unit. This proactive fix and accessible after-sales contact justify a strong score, with the caveat that long-term field data are still accumulating. [2][6][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

FT1 tuning prioritizes a warm, bass-forward presentation over strict neutrality, trading some isolation and FR consistency for engaging tone and premium materials. The choices are coherent for casual listening and creation workflows but aren’t optimized for reference-grade monitoring.

## Advice

If you want handsome, comfortable closed-backs with low measured distortion and a rich tonality, the FT1 delivers at 149 USD, especially with its balanced cable in the box. If you prioritize **neutrality and measurable isolation** at the lowest price, the AKG K371 currently undercuts it on price while matching or edging it on key lab metrics. For commuters demanding stronger isolation, consider ANC models; for studio neutrality, also cross-shop reference-tuned closed-backs.
