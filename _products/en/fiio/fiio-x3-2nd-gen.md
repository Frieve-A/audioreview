## Overview

The FiiO X3 2nd Generation is a portable high-resolution Digital Audio Player (DAP) that was manufactured by Chinese audio company FiiO before being discontinued. Measuring 96.7 mm × 57.7 mm × 16.1 mm with full aluminum body construction, the device features a 2-inch LCD screen with 320×240 resolution and jog wheel navigation [1]. The X3 2nd Generation supports comprehensive audio formats including native DSD decoding up to DSD128, 24-bit/192kHz PCM, and multiple output options including headphone, line, and coaxial digital outputs [2]. Originally priced at 199 USD, the device represented significant value through its use of the Cirrus Logic CS4398 DAC chip typically found in much more expensive equipment [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The X3 2nd Generation demonstrates strong performance in available specifications, particularly the 114 dB signal-to-noise ratio which significantly exceeds the transparent level threshold [1]. Output impedance values of 0.34-0.39Ω across gain settings ensure proper headphone matching without impedance-related issues [4]. Line output at 1.45 Vrms approaches the standard 1.5V level, while maximum output capabilities of 1.345-2.69 Vrms across gain settings provide adequate power delivery [4]. However, critical measurement parameters including THD/THD+N, frequency response deviation, intermodulation distortion, and crosstalk specifications remain unavailable from credible third-party sources. Without comprehensive independent measurements for these audibility-critical parameters, conservative evaluation protocols require score adjustment from the initially indicated 0.7 level to the final 0.6 assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The X3 2nd Generation employed an in-house designed architecture combining a Cirrus Logic CS4398 DAC, JZ4760B XBurst 600MHz processor, and Texas Instruments OPA1642/LMH6643 operational amplifiers [1]. Dual crystal oscillator design targeting different sample rate families (44.1kHz and 48kHz) for jitter reduction demonstrates FiiO's accumulated engineering expertise [3]. However, evaluated against current technology standards, the CS4398 and JZ4760B processor are now obsolete. Current DAPs at equivalent or lower price points employ significantly superior chips such as dual CS43198 DACs, achieving SNR exceeding 124 dB and THD+N below 0.0012% [5]. The absence of balanced output circuitry (4.4mm), modern SoC integration, and wireless connectivity further demonstrates the platform's technological obsolescence. No current manufacturer would seek to adopt this technology, and new entrants can easily surpass its capabilities using readily available modern components.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The X3 2nd Generation at 199 USD provided comprehensive functionality including native DSD decoding (DSD64/DSD128), 10-band EQ, 24-bit/192kHz PCM support, multiple output options (3.5mm headphone, line, coaxial SPDIF, USB DAC), physical navigation controls, and all major audio format support [2]. The cheapest currently available product with equivalent-or-better user-facing functions and measured performance is the FiiO JM21 at 179.99 USD [5]. The JM21 features dual CS43198 DACs with SNR of 124 dB or above and THD+N below 0.0012% (3.5mm), native DSD256 support, coaxial SPDIF output via shared 3.5mm port, line output, balanced 4.4mm output, USB DAC mode (384kHz/32bit), and Android 13 with WiFi and Bluetooth 5.1 [5]. Equipped with all equivalent outputs (headphone, line, coaxial SPDIF, USB DAC), EQ, and DSD/PCM support, the JM21's SNR (124 dB or above vs 114 dB) demonstrates equivalent-or-better measured performance.

CP = 179.99 USD ÷ 199 USD = 0.9

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

FiiO demonstrates robust support infrastructure with global manufacturer assistance when dealer support proves insufficient [4]. The company actively developed firmware improvements, with final firmware 2.0 adding substantial features including library search functions, manual database clearing, various playback modes, and technical options for DAC output filtering [4]. Full aluminum body construction provides durability advantages over plastic alternatives [1]. However, some users reported "not seen as storage" connectivity issues, though FiiO stated these were not common problems and provided technical support for resolution [4]. The combination of direct manufacturer support, regular firmware updates, robust construction, and responsive issue resolution demonstrates above-average reliability and support standards for the product category.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

FiiO's design approach demonstrates scientific rationality focused on measurable performance improvements. The company philosophy addresses industry issues with counterfeit components by utilizing only name-brand, licensed chips directly supporting measurement-based audio quality enhancements [1]. Selection of the CS4398 DAC represented cost-effective adoption of proven high-performance technology with superior low-pass filtering and jitter control compared to the first generation's WM8740 [1]. Substantial improvements from first to second generation models show rational performance progression through better component selection and architecture design [1]. All major cost investments directly contributed to user-facing functions and measurable performance parameters. However, as a standalone DAP without WiFi, streaming capability, or modern connectivity, the dedicated equipment approach lacks clear justification over smartphone-based alternatives with external DAC/amplifiers that deliver equivalent or superior measured performance at comparable or lower cost. The design direction, while scientifically grounded, represents a conservative approach that does not leverage software, internet, or AI integration for user benefit.

## Advice

The FiiO X3 2nd Generation represented solid value in the portable DAP market before discontinuation, offering reliable DAC implementation at an accessible 199 USD price point. The device suited users requiring native DSD support, multiple output options including coaxial SPDIF, and robust build quality. Current availability is limited to second-hand markets. For equivalent or superior functionality today, the FiiO JM21 (179.99 USD) offers significantly improved DAC performance (dual CS43198, SNR 124 dB or above), balanced output, WiFi streaming, and Android 13 [5]. Alternatively, a smartphone paired with a USB DAC/amplifier provides comparable audio quality with greater versatility.
