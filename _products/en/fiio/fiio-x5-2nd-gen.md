## Overview

The FiiO X5 2nd Generation, released in 2015 at 349 USD, represented FiiO's approach to premium digital audio players during the early high-resolution audio era. **Important: Released in 2015, this product is currently available primarily through used markets as new retail distribution has become limited or ceased.** Measuring 109mm × 63.5mm × 15.3mm and weighing 165g, the device features a titanium color variant with aluminum alloy chassis (CNC-machined). The X5 2nd Generation employs a Texas Instruments PCM1792A DAC with native DSD decoding support, coupled with OPA1612 operational amplifiers and BUF634U current buffers. With dual microSD card slots supporting up to 256GB total storage, a 2.4-inch IPS display (400×360), and classic scroll wheel navigation, it aimed to deliver audiophile-grade portable playback with extensive format support including DSD64/128, 24-bit/192kHz PCM, and direct SACD ISO playback.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The X5 2nd Generation achieves excellent measured performance specifications based on manufacturer data [2]. THD+N measures <0.001% at 1kHz, significantly below the 0.01% transparent threshold. Signal-to-noise ratio reaches ≥114dB (A-weighted) and dynamic range exceeds 110dB, both surpassing the 105dB transparent level. Crosstalk performance >115dB (interpreted as <-115dB) provides exceptional channel separation, well below the -70dB transparent requirement. Frequency response spans the full 20Hz-20kHz audible range [2]. Output power specifications of 436mW@16Ω, 245mW@32Ω, and 27mW@300Ω provide adequate drive capability for intended headphone impedances [1]. All measurements significantly exceed problematic levels and achieve transparent performance thresholds. As manufacturer specifications without independent verification, a conservative evaluation approach is applied, though the specifications remain well within transparent performance levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The X5 2nd Generation implements solid but conventional audio technology appropriate for its 2015 release period. The PCM1792A DAC from Texas Instruments provided high-quality digital-to-analog conversion with hardware DSD64/128 decoding capability, representing contemporary best practices. The audio signal path utilizes OPA1612 operational amplifiers for low-pass filtering and voltage amplification, achieving low distortion specifications (0.000015%) and noise (1.1 nV/√Hz). BUF634U current buffers supply up to 250mA output current. Dual crystal oscillators for 44.1kHz and 48kHz multiples minimize jitter and resampling artifacts. The JZ4760B system-on-chip handles digital processing duties. While technically competent and desirable when released, the implementation represents standard industry approaches without proprietary innovations or patents. By 2026 standards, the technology appears outdated compared to current integrated solutions and software-based signal processing approaches. The design demonstrates technical expertise in audio chain optimization but lacks forward-looking innovation or competitive differentiation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Discontinued Product Note: As this 2015-released product is no longer in retail distribution and is primarily available through used markets, cost-performance is evaluated against current retail alternatives.** The HiBy R3 Pro II at 199 USD provides equivalent-or-better performance: dual CS43198 DACs versus the X5's single PCM1792A, superior 480mW@32Ω output power versus 245mW@32Ω, enhanced DSD256 support versus DSD64/128, higher 126-128dB SNR versus ≥114dB, improved 128dB dynamic range versus >110dB, larger 3.3-inch touchscreen versus 2.4-inch display, and 4000mAh battery. Equipped with equivalent playback functions and measured performance that meets or exceeds the X5 2nd Generation. CP = 199 ÷ 349 = 0.57, rounded to 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The X5 2nd Generation exhibits mixed reliability characteristics with documented quality control issues. While the digital player structure contains fewer moving parts than mechanical devices, known headphone jack defects affect connection reliability, with users reporting devices showing headphones connected but producing no sound due to hardware failures between the motherboard and headphone jack. FiiO maintains a global support system. However, customer service reviews indicate slow response times with reports of lengthy troubleshooting processes before repair approval. Some users experienced warranty service struggles extending over a month and a half, with solutions requiring customer financial responsibility for defective products. Standard warranty terms apply, but coverage excludes damage from vibrating, bumping, falling, unauthorized disassembly, humid environments, water exposure, and natural disasters. The documented headphone jack reliability issues represent higher than average failure rates for specific components, impacting overall product reliability assessment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

FiiO's design philosophy for the X5 2nd Generation reflects mixed rationality from current perspective. The company demonstrates measurement-focused scientific approach with published specifications, though also emphasizes artistic elements mixing science with aesthetics in their design philosophy. Design costs contribute to audio functionality through quality component selection (PCM1792A, OPA1612), though some premium materials may not directly improve measured performance. Newer FiiO models show functional and integration improvements, indicating rational development progression. However, the dedicated DAP approach that was appropriate for 2015 offers limited justification versus smartphone plus external DAC solutions by 2026 standards. The conservative approach using proven components rather than innovative solutions lacks forward-looking development. While the audio-specific equipment justification existed in 2015 when dedicated DAPs offered advantages over smartphone solutions, this rationale has weakened significantly as general-purpose devices achieved equivalent performance. The design demonstrates competent engineering but limited innovation beyond conventional implementation of established high-quality components.

## Advice

**For Used Market Consideration:** As a product no longer in retail distribution, the FiiO X5 2nd Generation should only be considered for purchase through used markets at significantly reduced prices from the original 349 USD. While the device achieves excellent technical audio performance, buyers must weigh vintage DAP limitations against modern alternatives. Current alternatives like the HiBy R3 Pro II at 199 USD or FiiO's own M21 at 329 USD provide equivalent or better audio quality with modern operating systems, streaming capabilities, and contemporary user interfaces. **Key ownership considerations for used purchases:** documented headphone jack reliability issues represent significant risk, especially without warranty coverage. Support availability is limited for discontinued products, and replacement parts may be difficult to obtain. For users specifically seeking vintage DAP experience or already familiar with the device ecosystem, purchase prices below 150 USD might provide reasonable value given the technical competence. However, for most users, modern alternatives offer superior functionality, reliability, and support. Consider current-generation DAPs or smartphone plus external DAC solutions for better long-term value and feature accessibility.
