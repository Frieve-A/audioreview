## Overview

The JM21 is a digital audio player built around dual Cirrus Logic CS43198 DACs and dual SGM8262 amps in a fully balanced path. It runs Android 13 on Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 with 3GB RAM/32GB ROM and features a 4.7" display, 4.4mm balanced and 3.5mm SE outputs, coaxial out, USB DAC mode, and Bluetooth 5.0 with LDAC/aptX HD/LHDC. The chassis is ~13mm thin and ~156g, with rated playback of ~12.5h (SE) or ~9.5h (balanced) [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Figures are manufacturer specifications: balanced THD+N < 0.0006% at 1kHz/-4dB into 32Ω, S/N ≥129dB; frequency response deviation <0.03dB (20Hz–20kHz); crosstalk ≥110dB. Single-ended THD+N < 0.0012%, S/N ≥124dB, FR deviation <0.02dB, crosstalk ≥70dB [1]. These numbers indicate excellent transparency potential, but independent third-party measurements are not yet confirmed, hence the score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A solid, modern implementation: dual CS43198 with a fully balanced path, SGM8262 output stage, Android 13 on Snapdragon 680, and comprehensive wireless/streaming support [1][2]. The emphasis is on competent integration and high output (700mW+700mW at 32Ω balanced) within a thin chassis rather than novel circuit topology [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

JM21’s market price is 199 USD [2][3]. We could not identify any **cheaper** finished product that matches or exceeds its user-visible functions (Android with app installs, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, 4.4mm balanced out) **and** published performance envelope. For context, HiBy R5 Gen 2 is 349 USD [4]; Shanling M3 Ultra is around 469 USD [7]; Sony NW-A306 supports Android but lacks 4.4mm balanced and thus isn’t an equivalent substitute [5]. Therefore CP=1.0 due to the absence of a cheaper equivalent-or-better alternative.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

FiiO’s global sales/support footprint and OTA update paths are documented [2]. As a 2025 model, long-term failure-rate data are not yet available, and durability of the ultra-thin build remains to be seen.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The product targets low distortion/noise and ample output within a mainstream SoC/OS platform and balanced output—an evidence-oriented direction [1][2]. While phone + dongle can replicate many functions, an all-in-one DAP still offers integrated power management, coaxial out, and tidy carry. The approach is pragmatic rather than novel.

## Advice

Ideal for listeners who want streaming-centric Android usability and wired transparency from a single device. The rated performance, balanced drive capability, and Android 13 convenience make it a strong one-box solution versus juggling phone + dongle [1][2].
