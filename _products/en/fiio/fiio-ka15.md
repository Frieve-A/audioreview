## Overview

The FiiO KA15 is a portable USB DAC/amp positioned between the KA13 and KA17. Released in 2024, it uses dual Cirrus Logic CS43198 DACs and is the first in FiiO’s dongle lineup to feature a 0.96-inch IPS **color** screen. It supports up to 768kHz/32-bit PCM and DSD256, provides 3.5mm SE and 4.4mm balanced outputs, a **10-band parametric EQ** (PEQ), and a shared 3.5mm **SPDIF (coax)** output. It offers app control and even a web PEQ utility, plus UAC 1.0 mode for game consoles. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer parameters indicate **THD+N < 0.0004%** (-4 dB, 32Ω, balanced), **SNR ≥ 123 dB** A-weighted (balanced), and **noise floor** of **<1.7 µV (SE)** / **<3.2 µV (balanced)**. Crosstalk is specified at **≥74 dB (SE)** and **≥113 dB (balanced)** at 1 kHz/32Ω. Max balanced output is **560 mW + 560 mW @ 32Ω** in desktop mode. Frequency response deviation remains within **≤0.1 dB** across the audible band. These values comfortably exceed transparency thresholds typical for portable DAC/amps; however, independent lab measurements are still limited. [1]

**What the numbers mean (briefly):**  
SNR at ~123 dB and THD+N below 0.001% place the KA15 in the “transparent” zone for linearity and noise; the low-µV noise floor is appropriate for sensitive IEMs, and the 560 mW/32Ω balanced power is ample for many full-size dynamics/planars. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The KA15 combines proven chips (dual CS43198) with thoughtful features rather than bleeding-edge architecture. Notable engineering work includes **dynamic power adjustment** with real-time voltage/current monitoring, an **ultra-low-power sleep mode**, on-device color UI, and a full **10-band PEQ** controllable via app or web. It also supports UAC 1.0 for Switch/PS5 connectivity. These are modern, practical features, though not fundamentally new signal-processing innovations. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Market price (United States): 99.99 USD** at the time of review (Amazon US). [3]

To assign CP, we search for the **cheapest product that is _equal or better_ in both features and measured performance**. As of **August 14, 2025**, we did **not** find a cheaper dongle that **matches or exceeds** the KA15’s combination of:  
- ≥560 mW (balanced, 32Ω),  
- on-device **color display**,  
- built-in **10-band PEQ**, and  
- **SPDIF** output.  

Therefore, CP = **1.0**.

For context (not equal comparators):  
- **iBasso DC04PRO** lists **280 mW @ 32Ω (balanced)** with **SNR 131 dBA / THD+N 0.00013%**, but **no on-device PEQ/color screen/SPDIF**; typical price **119 USD** (official). [4][5]  
- **SMSL D10** is much cheaper (≈ **69.99 USD**) and claims **500 mW @ 32Ω**, but it also lacks **PEQ**, **color screen**, and **SPDIF**. [6]

Because no cheaper **equal or better** alternative exists, KA15 is currently the best value at its capability level.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

FiiO provides **one-month replacement** and **one-year free maintenance** warranty coverage (terms may vary by region). FiiO publishes parameters, offers Control app + web PEQ, and maintains active support pages/forums. The aluminum build and simple dongle form factor suggest average long-term durability for the category; comprehensive multi-year reliability data is not yet available given the product’s recency. [6][2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

FiiO’s choices emphasize measurable transparency (low THD+N, high SNR), **user-adjustable** frequency response via **PEQ**, adequate **power** for real-world loads, and practical usability (screen, UAC 1.0 mode). The feature set maps directly to audible outcomes (fit to headphone response, sufficient current delivery), avoiding marketing-centric claims.

## Advice

If you want a dongle that **both measures cleanly** and **lets you tune your sound on the device** with a **color UI**, the KA15 is easy to recommend—especially at **99.99 USD**. If you don’t need on-device PEQ/SPDIF and prioritize ultra-low noise figures at lower power, the DC04PRO is a fine alternative; if you only need high power at the lowest price and can forgo the advanced features, budget units like the SMSL D10 exist—but neither matches the KA15’s overall capability/feature set.
