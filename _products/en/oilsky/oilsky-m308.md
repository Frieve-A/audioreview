## Overview

The Oilsky M308 is an Android-based digital audio player featuring an ESS9018Q2M DAC chip and comprehensive high-resolution audio support up to DSD512. Positioned as a budget-oriented portable audio solution, the M308 combines Android functionality with WiFi connectivity and Bluetooth 4.1 LDAC support. Available sources indicate both Android 9.0 and Android 13.0 versions exist in the market. The device includes a 2.8-inch touchscreen, expandable storage up to 1TB, and targets users seeking an affordable entry point into high-resolution portable audio with smartphone-like connectivity features.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The M308 lacks credible third-party measurement data for critical audio quality metrics including THD, SNR, frequency response, and dynamic range. While the ESS9018Q2M DAC chip specifications indicate excellent theoretical performance (123dB dynamic range, -115dB THD+N), these are chip-level specifications that do not reflect actual implemented performance. Output power specifications of 28mW@32Ω appear below optimal levels for many headphones. Without verified measurement data from independent testing laboratories, Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The M308 represents a basic implementation of existing technologies without significant innovation. While incorporating the capable ESS9018Q2M DAC, the implementation appears standard without proprietary technology or technical differentiation. Use of outdated Android 9.0 and Bluetooth 4.1 demonstrates lack of contemporary technology adoption. The device appears to be an OEM/ODM product with standard components offering no competitive technological advantages that other companies would seek to adopt. Technology integration is appropriate but conservative, using proven components without advancement in design or implementation sophistication.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At approximately 70 USD, the M308 provides equivalent-or-better functionality compared to the Shanling M2X at 219 USD. The M308 offers Android operating system, WiFi connectivity, Bluetooth 4.1 with LDAC support, expandable storage to 1TB, high-resolution audio support up to 192kHz/24-bit, DSD512 capability, and 2.8-inch touchscreen interface. The Shanling M2X provides superior Android implementation, higher-resolution 3.2-inch display, and confirmed measurement data, but costs significantly more. No cheaper currently available Android-based DAP with equivalent WiFi and high-resolution audio functionality was identified in current market research. CP = 219 ÷ 70 = 3.13, but clamped to maximum value of 1.0, indicating the M308 is the cheapest option with equivalent functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The M308 demonstrates mixed reliability indicators with limited manufacturer support infrastructure. Standard consumer warranty period likely extends one year with primary reliance on dealer/distributor support rather than direct manufacturer service. Limited firmware update infrastructure is evident from official website access restrictions. Third-party debloating tools suggest potential Android stability issues requiring user intervention. However, some distributors provide positive customer service feedback, and availability of third-party accessories indicates reasonable market presence. Unknown manufacturer track record and limited global support infrastructure reduce confidence in long-term reliability and service availability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The M308 demonstrates rational design philosophy by focusing on proven ESS DAC technology, Android integration for modern connectivity, and comprehensive format support without excessive unmeasurable claims. Cost allocation appears to contribute meaningfully to functionality and performance rather than superficial enhancements. Good functional integration combines Android OS, WiFi connectivity, and high-resolution audio capabilities in a justified portable solution. However, conservative technology adoption using older Android 9.0 version and limited innovation beyond standard component integration reduce the philosophy's forward-looking aspects. The approach emphasizes practical functionality over exotic audio claims, representing reasonable engineering priorities for the target market segment.

## Advice

The M308 suits users seeking budget Android DAP functionality with high-resolution audio support and WiFi connectivity. Best value proposition exists for listeners requiring Android app compatibility, streaming service access, and portable high-resolution playback without premium DAP costs. Potential buyers should consider output power limitations (28mW@32Ω) when selecting headphones, as efficiency requirements may restrict compatible models. Users prioritizing measurement validation should seek alternatives with verified third-party testing data. The device represents reasonable entry-level choice for Android-based portable audio, particularly when cost considerations outweigh performance optimization requirements.
