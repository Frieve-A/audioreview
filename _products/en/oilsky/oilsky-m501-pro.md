## Overview

The Oilsky M501 Pro is a budget-oriented digital audio player featuring Android 8.1 OS with multimedia capabilities. The device includes a 4.7-inch touchscreen, WiFi connectivity, and access to Google Play Store for streaming services. With 96GB total storage (16GB internal + 64GB SD card), the player supports various audio formats including lossless FLAC and claims 24-bit/192kHz audio resolution support. Marketed as a multimedia entertainment device rather than a dedicated audiophile player, it emphasizes convenience and visual features over scientific audio engineering.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data. While the M501 Pro claims "HiFi lossless sound quality" and features a "high-performance DAC with professional intelligent digital noise reduction chips," credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant technical information [1]. The complete absence of independent audio quality measurements prevents proper technical evaluation against established criteria for THD, S/N ratio, frequency response, and dynamic range. According to investigation findings, no evidence exists of proprietary DAC implementations or advanced audio processing algorithms that distinguish this device from standard consumer electronics [1]. Without measurable performance data, the actual audio quality capabilities remain unverified.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The device employs outdated technology with Android 8.1 (2017 release) and Bluetooth 4.0, significantly behind current standards. Investigation reveals no evidence of proprietary DAC implementations, advanced audio processing algorithms, or innovative technical approaches that distinguish the M501 Pro from competing OEM/ODM manufacturers [1]. The technology implementation uses standard consumer electronics components without significant technical differentiation or competitive advantages that would be difficult for competitors to replicate. While the device appropriately combines Android, digital processing, and software systems, it lacks cutting-edge integration and relies primarily on mature, widely available technology without meaningful innovation in the digital audio player space.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The M501 Pro currently sells for 67.49 USD and represents the world's cheapest Android DAP with full Google Play Store access and multimedia capabilities [2]. After comprehensive market research, no Android-based digital audio players with equivalent user-facing functionality exist at lower pricing in 2025. Dedicated audio players like the FiiO SnowSky Echo Mini (49.99 USD) and HiBy R1 lack essential Android OS functionality, Google Play Store access, and app installation capabilities that define the M501 Pro's value proposition [6]. The cheapest Android DAPs with equivalent streaming service access and multimedia features start at 150-200 USD price points with devices like the HiBy M300 (159 USD). Therefore, no cheaper equivalent exists, establishing CP = 1.0 for consumers seeking Android-based portable multimedia players with audio capabilities.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The device shows concerning reliability indicators based on available data. Customer satisfaction averages 3.6 stars on Amazon, with reported battery problems affecting the standard M501 model where users noted "the battery gave out and refused to charge at random" [4]. Warranty coverage includes only 30-day defect protection with one-year support via email contact, falling below industry standards [4]. The support infrastructure consists primarily of limited email-based assistance without established global service networks. Investigation confirms "limited global support infrastructure" with previous company evaluation scoring 0.4/5 for reliability and support [1]. The combination of shorter warranty periods, reported hardware failures, and minimal support infrastructure significantly impacts the reliability assessment for this budget device.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The design philosophy prioritizes multimedia entertainment features over scientific audio engineering, emphasizing visual appeal and convenience rather than measurable audio fidelity improvements [1]. The company markets devices as "HiFi" without substantive performance evidence, making claims about "professional intelligent digital noise reduction chips" without supporting measurement data [1]. Investigation reveals that the manufacturer emphasizes features like cameras and large touchscreens while using outdated technology (Android 8.1, Bluetooth 4.0) without innovative approaches to audio quality enhancement. The cost structure appears focused on multimedia and visual features rather than components that would meaningfully improve measured audio performance. This approach lacks scientific basis for sound quality improvement claims and represents a conservative, entertainment-focused design philosophy rather than one grounded in objective audio engineering principles.

## Advice

The Oilsky M501 Pro serves budget-conscious consumers seeking the most affordable Android-based multimedia player with Google Play Store access and streaming capabilities. Recommended for casual listening where convenience, app installation, streaming service access, and visual features outweigh audio fidelity requirements. With excellent cost-performance as the cheapest Android DAP available in 2025, it provides unmatched value for users requiring smartphone-like functionality in a dedicated music player. However, the device is not recommended for audiophiles or users prioritizing scientific audio engineering, as the unverified audio quality claims and reliability concerns limit its suitability for serious listening applications. For pure audio performance without Android features, consider dedicated DAPs with proven specifications; for superior Android DAP experience, expect to invest 150-200 USD minimum for devices with better measured performance and long-term reliability.
