## Overview

The Fyne Audio F303 is a discontinued 2-way floorstanding loudspeaker in a D’Appolito layout (two 150 mm multi-fibre mid/bass drivers around a 25 mm polyester-dome tweeter). It uses Fyne’s FyneFlute surround geometry on the woofers and a tweeter assembly reported to employ a neodymium magnet with a phase-compensator disc behind the protective mesh. The F303 sat below the current F303i successor and is listed under “Discontinued” on Fyne’s site. [1][3][8][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications state 91 dB (2.83 V/1 m) sensitivity, 8 Ω nominal impedance and a –6 dB in-room frequency response of 32 Hz–28 kHz with a 3.2 kHz crossover. However, no credible third-party full CTA-2034 “spinorama” or equivalent independent measurements for the F303 could be located at review time. In the absence of verified response linearity, distortion and impedance plots, the scientific validity remains at the policy baseline pending independent data. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Solid, conventional engineering: D’Appolito geometry for smoother vertical dispersion through the crossover, FyneFlute surrounds to better terminate cone edge energy, and a tweeter assembly described as using a neodymium motor with a phase-compensation disc to regularize HF radiation. Porting is rear-firing (no BassTrax diffuser here). These are sensible choices, if not cutting-edge DSP-aided designs. [1][3][8]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Denominator (review target price used for CP): 825 USD.**  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator identified:** **Monoprice Monolith Encore T6 (pair)** — a passive floorstanding design with verified CTA-2034 measurements and broadly similar full-range use case. Its current non-sale MSRP is **800 USD/pair**. Calculation (required to show since CP < 1.0 before rounding): **800 USD ÷ 825 USD = 0.97** → rounded to one decimal place = **1.0** (score). Selection basis: independently measured neutral response under ANSI/CTA-2034-A, comparable low-frequency reach for music use, and no deficit in core user-oriented functions (stereo, passive, floorstanding). Note the T6’s sensitivity is lower (~88–90 dB), but reviewers confirm typical AVRs can drive it to high levels, so practical output is not inferior for normal rooms. [5][7][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Fyne provides a **7-year warranty** for passive loudspeakers purchased via authorized dealers. That is good policy-level support. As a discontinued model, parts/logistics may depend on dealer networks and inventory, so we keep the score neutral overall. [4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design prioritizes known, measurable mechanisms (dispersion management via D’Appolito, surround geometry to control breakup) without making occult claims. The successor F303i updates the tweeter material to titanium but keeps a similar topology, which suggests steady, rational iteration rather than fashion-driven changes. [1][2][3]

## Advice

If you want a current production model with similar footprint and updated HF hardware, look at the **F303i**. If your priority is objectively vetted performance per dollar, the **Monoprice Monolith Encore T6** is the standout alternative with public CTA-2034 data and lower MSRP. For any F303 you find as new-old-stock, confirm dealer authorization for warranty eligibility. [2][5][7][4]
