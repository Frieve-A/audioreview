## Overview

The Focal Clear MG represents Focal's advancement in headphone driver technology, featuring proprietary magnesium 'M'-shaped dome drivers developed over four years of research. These open-back headphones target audiophiles seeking premium sound reproduction with French engineering heritage. The Clear MG utilizes 40mm magnesium dome drivers with enhanced lightness, rigidity, and damping compared to traditional aluminum-magnesium alloys, paired with solid aluminum construction and premium materials including leather headband and microfiber earpads.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Clear MG demonstrates reasonable measured performance approaching transparent levels. The frequency response of 5Hz-28kHz with ±3dB tolerance from 5Hz-23kHz meets standard criteria for headphones, offering full audible spectrum coverage. The harmonic distortion rate of 0.25% @ 1kHz/100dB SPL falls within acceptable range for headphones (below the 0.5% problematic threshold), though significantly above the 0.05% excellent level required for top-tier measurements. The 55-ohm impedance and 104dB SPL/1mW sensitivity provide adequate drive characteristics for most amplifiers. Third-party measurements confirm performance similar to the original Clear [1], indicating consistent engineering. Conservative scoring adjustment applied due to reliance on manufacturer specifications rather than fully independent verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Focal demonstrates significant technological advancement through proprietary magnesium dome technology developed after four years of research. The exclusive magnesium 'M'-shaped dome design offers enhanced lightness, rigidity, and damping compared to previous aluminum-magnesium alloy drivers, representing genuine in-house innovation and patent technology. Focal's status as a Living Heritage Company with extensive R&D investment and complete control over production processes demonstrates high technical expertise. The technology integration appropriately combines advanced materials science with precision manufacturing, though the approach remains within established headphone design paradigms rather than revolutionary advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The Clear MG demonstrates low cost-performance when compared to equivalent-or-better alternatives. At 1490 USD, the Sennheiser HD650 provides equivalent-or-better specifications at approximately 340 USD [2]. The HD650 features frequency response 10Hz-39,500Hz (superior high-frequency extension compared to Clear MG's 5Hz-28kHz), harmonic distortion 0.05% (significantly superior to Clear MG's 0.25%), and sensitivity 103dB SPL/1mW@1kHz (equivalent to Clear MG's 104dB SPL/1mW@1kHz). Both offer equivalent open-back design and high-quality audio reproduction capabilities. The HD650 specifications are equivalent-or-better across measured performance criteria. CP = 340 USD ÷ 1490 USD = 0.2. The HD650 represents a more cost-effective option offering equivalent-or-better measured performance at significantly lower pricing.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Focal offers standard 2-year warranty on headphones through authorized dealer networks globally [4]. The construction features solid aluminum yoke and premium materials designed for durability, though some user reports indicate potential issues with headband mechanisms and driver longevity in certain units [5]. The repair infrastructure operates through dealer networks with repair services handled regionally. Maintenance costs include replacement earpads which are priced higher than some competitors, though this reflects the specialized materials and manufacturing requirements [5]. The simple driver design with minimal electronic components provides inherent reliability advantages typical of passive headphone construction.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Focal demonstrates exemplary scientific approach with their "Listen to your music, not your loudspeakers or headphones" philosophy emphasizing transparent reproduction [3]. The company invests extensively in measurement-based R&D with complete in-house driver manufacturing and testing both by computer and by ear, representing ideal scientific methodology. The magnesium dome technology represents rational innovation directly contributing to measurable improvements in rigidity, damping, and reduced distortion compared to traditional materials. Focal's Living Heritage Company status and full production control from driver design through final assembly demonstrates proper cost optimization for achieving performance targets. The premium pricing reflects genuine technological advancement and manufacturing quality rather than marketing positioning, with all costs contributing to acoustic performance and long-term reliability.

## Advice

The Clear MG suits serious audiophiles seeking reference-level performance in the ultra-premium headphone category. At 1490 USD, it offers genuine technological advancement through magnesium dome technology and French manufacturing excellence, though the Clear Mg Pro provides equivalent performance at significantly lower cost. The Clear MG is most appropriate for dedicated listening setups with quality amplification, where its neutral signature and detailed presentation can be fully appreciated. Potential buyers should consider the premium maintenance costs and dealer-based support infrastructure when planning long-term ownership, and evaluate whether the Clear Mg Pro's equivalent specifications better suit their budget requirements. The headphones excel for critical listening, mixing, and audiophile applications where transparency and accuracy are prioritized over colored sound signatures.
