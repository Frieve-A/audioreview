## Overview

The Sub One is a professional active subwoofer with **dual 8-inch Slatefiber woofers** and **200W RMS (2×100W Class D)**[1][2]. It’s rated **32–120 Hz (±3 dB)** with **114 dB peak @1 m**[2][4], and offers **XLR L/R plus LFE I/O**, **adjustable LPF 45–120 Hz**, **HPF 60/90 Hz** for satellites, **0–180° phase**, **polarity invert**, and a **footswitch for bass-management bypass**[1][4]. Availability was **February 2022**[5]. Typical US street price is **1,199 USD**[3][4][15].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No independent third-party measurements were located; the assessment is based on manufacturer/retailer specifications (**32–120 Hz ±3 dB**, **114 dB peak**, **200W RMS**)[2][4]. If verified lab data (e.g., THD vs. SPL, group delay) emerges, this score should be updated.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Slatefiber cones, front ports, and comprehensive 2.1 bass management (**LPF/HPF/phase/polarity/footswitch**) are practical for studio use[1][4][15]. However, there’s no onboard room auto-calibration/DSP, so innovation is moderate versus some peers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

- **US basis**: Sub One = **1,199 USD**[3][4][15]  
- **Cheapest ≥performance comparator**: **KRK S12.4 = 749.99 USD**, **26–97 Hz (±3 dB)**, **119.9 dB peak**[5][6][7][19]

**Computation**: 749.99 USD ÷ 1,199 USD = **0.625** → **0.6**.  
S12.4 extends deeper within the **±3 dB** window and reaches higher peak SPL at a lower price. **JBL LSR310S** at **399 USD** is a strong budget option, but its **27 Hz** figure is an **extension spec** (commonly –10 dB) and max SPL **113 dB peak**, so it doesn't clearly satisfy the "≥performance" criterion used here[10][11].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Solid construction, adequate Class-D headroom, and established dealer/support networks suggest good reliability and serviceability[1][13]. Limited long-term field data prevents a perfect score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The feature set sensibly targets studio integration[1][15], but at **1,199 USD** the proposition is challenged by **KRK S12.4 (749.99 USD)** offering equal or better measurable output for less[5][6][7].

## Advice

- **Best measurable output per dollar**: **KRK S12.4 (749.99 USD)** — **26–97 Hz (±3 dB)**, **119.9 dB peak**[5][6][7].  
- **High headroom / versatile**: **Kali WS-12 V2 (999 USD)** — **30–200 Hz (±3 dB)**, **123 dB peak**; studio/PA capable[8][9].  
- **Tight budgets**: **JBL LSR310S (399 USD)** — attractive pricing; note **–10 dB-style extension** uses a different benchmark[10][11].
