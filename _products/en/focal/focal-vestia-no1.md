## Overview

The Focal Vestia No1 is a bookshelf speaker from the Vestia series, announced in 2023. Developed by French premium audio manufacturer Focal, this product aims to deliver technologies from higher-end models at a more accessible price. It employs a 2-way design featuring a 6.5-inch Slatefiber diaphragm woofer and a 1-inch TAM (Aluminum/Magnesium alloy) inverted dome tweeter. The speaker is characterized by Focal's sophisticated design and high build quality, achieved through consistent manufacturing in France.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Objective evaluation based on measurement data shows specifications of 56Hz-30kHz (±3dB) frequency response, 89.5dB/W sensitivity, and 8Ω impedance (minimum 4.6Ω). According to actual measurements by HomeTheaterHifi.com, while the speaker demonstrates good distortion characteristics at some frequencies (THD 0.072% at 60Hz, 0.079% at 200Hz), the THD at 100Hz reaches 0.89%. This figure is close to the "problematic level (1% or higher)" defined by our evaluation standards, indicating a clear issue with low-frequency control. This THD of 0.89% at 100Hz deviates significantly from the transparent level (under 0.1%), raising concerns about audible effects. Overall measurement performance falls below the industry average.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Slatefiber diaphragm technology is a unique composite material approach using recycled carbon fiber, representing a technical achievement in balancing light weight and rigidity. The combination of the TAM tweeter's aluminum-magnesium alloy diaphragm and a urethane waveguide is a scientifically sound design for directivity control and distortion suppression. The front-port design also shows consideration for near-wall placement. However, these technologies are fundamentally applications of existing materials science and acoustic engineering, with limited innovation. Compared to the Beryllium diaphragms and W-Sandwich construction used in Focal's higher-end models, the technological advantages are modest.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As the current market price for this product is difficult to verify, we will evaluate it based on its suggested retail price of 165,000 JPY (tax included). Competing products with equivalent or superior performance are available, such as the KEF Q150 (72,600 JPY) and the ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 (approx. 54,000 JPY). The KEF Q150, in particular, achieves comparable or better performance at a significantly lower price with its Uni-Q coaxial driver technology. Cost-performance is calculated as `Competitor Price ÷ Subject Price`, which results in "72,600 JPY ÷ 165,000 JPY ≈ 0.44". Rounding this to the nearest tenth gives a score of 0.4.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Established in 1979, Focal is a veteran audio manufacturer with a strong track record for product reliability. Consistent manufacturing in France ensures thorough quality control, and the reliability for long-term use under appropriate conditions is highly regarded. An international support system is in place, and professional responses can be expected for technical inquiries. However, characteristic of a high-end brand, costs for parts and maintenance tend to be higher than for mass-market products. The warranty period is at the industry standard level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design approach of the Vestia No1 is fundamentally an extension of conventional bookshelf speakers, showing no dramatic improvements in measurement performance or innovative approaches. The adoption of the Slatefiber diaphragm is heavily influenced by environmental considerations and cost reduction, with limited contribution to acoustic performance improvement. The TAM tweeter is also an improved version of existing technology and does not significantly exceed the performance levels achievable at this price point. The product's reason for being as a dedicated audio device is questionable, especially when competitors offer equivalent functionality and performance at a lower price. Overall, the approach lacks sufficient rationality toward achieving scientifically transparent sound quality and price disruption.

## Advice

Currently, the market availability of the Focal Vestia No1 is limited, with many retailers showing it as out of stock. This makes it difficult to purchase and creates a lack of price transparency. For users who prioritize scientific performance and value, we recommend alternatives that are more readily available and clearly priced. The KEF Q150 (72,600 JPY) offers excellent phase characteristics and good measurement data, thanks to its coaxial driver technology. The ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 (approx. 54,000 JPY) is also a strong contender, providing balanced performance. If you prefer the Focal brand, consider exploring other series with stable market supply.
