## Overview

The Focal Shape 40 is a compact 4-inch powered studio monitor aimed at close-range work in small rooms. It uses a 4" flax-sandwich woofer and 1" aluminum/magnesium “M-profile” inverted-dome tweeter, powered by dual Class-AB amps (25 W LF + 25 W HF). The cabinet has **no port**; instead it employs **dual side passive radiators**, enabling wall-adjacent placement. Manufacturer specs list frequency response of 60 Hz–35 kHz (±3 dB) and maximum SPL of 102 dB (peak @1 m). [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, standardized measurements (e.g., full spinoramas) for the Shape 40 are scarce. Based on manufacturer data, FR 60 Hz–35 kHz (±3 dB) is typical for compact monitors; 102 dB peak @1 m is adequate for nearfield use. THD figures are not published with test conditions, preventing comparison to category thresholds. With limited third-party data, the score defaults to the policy mid-point and remains provisional pending verified measurements. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Focal’s engineering shows moderate sophistication: proprietary **Flax cone**, **TMD** (tuned-mass-damper) surround, **NIC** magnetic-flux control, and a passive-radiator loading to avoid port noise in a tiny enclosure. Nevertheless, the overall approach is evolutionary rather than cutting-edge for 2025; conventional Class-AB amplification and lack of DSP room correction limit technical novelty. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Market price for the review target (pair) is **1098 USD**. [3] The **cheapest equal-or-better** alternative we can confirm is **JBL 305P MkII** (5" two-way with boundary EQ and HF shelf), which has robust independent measurements showing neutral response and low distortion. Typical market price (pair) is **318 USD**. Therefore:

**318 USD ÷ 1098 USD = 0.2896 → CP = 0.3 (rounded to one decimal).**  
Equivalence (user perspective): delivers the same core function (powered nearfield monitor) with **equal-or-better on/off-axis response and directivity** in standardized tests, and comparable or higher maximum output. [4][5]

(Another strong option, **Kali LP-6 V2**, also measures well but is currently priced higher and thus is not the cheapest comparator.) [6][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Focal provides a global support portal and dealer-based after-sales service; warranty terms vary by region, and **extended-warranty registration** exists in some markets. Public failure-rate data are not published, and firmware is not applicable to this analog monitor. Construction quality appears solid, but long-term reliability data specific to Shape 40 remain limited. [8][9]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Shape 40 targets very small spaces with wall-friendly placement via passive radiators and a compact baffle. However, absent evidence of superior measured transparency, the package does not rationally justify a large premium over mainstream monitors whose independent data show equal-or-better fidelity at far lower prices. Interesting features (Flax/TMD/NIC) do not translate into clearly better measured outcomes versus cheaper peers. [2][4]

## Advice

For cramped desks that demand ultra-short listening distances, the Shape 40 can work, and the radiator design eases placement near walls. Objectively, though, **value is poor**: independently measured monitors like the **JBL 305P MkII** offer excellent neutrality and higher output for a fraction of the price. If you can accommodate a slightly larger cabinet, also consider **Kali LP-6 V2**; it measures strongly and remains affordable. Prioritize models with published third-party data. [4][6][7]
