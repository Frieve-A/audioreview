## Overview

Alpha 80 Evo is the 8-inch, bi-amped model in Focal’s Alpha Evo line. It uses a 1-inch aluminum inverted-dome tweeter and an 8-inch Slatefiber-cone woofer in a front-ported MDF cabinet with wall-mount inserts. It accepts XLR, 1/4-inch TRS, and RCA simultaneously, and includes defeatable auto-standby plus low/high shelving EQ. Focal lists 38 Hz–22 kHz (±3 dB) response and 106 dB peak SPL. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, standardized third-party measurements (e.g., full spin data / Klippel NFS, multitone distortion) for Alpha 80 Evo are scarce. Therefore scientific certainty remains limited and defaults to 0.5 when robust independent data is unknown. Key **manufacturer** specs: FR (±3 dB) 38–22,000 Hz; Max SPL 106 dB (peak @1 m); Amplification 80 W LF + 35 W HF; construction **0.6 inch (15 mm) MDF**. [2]

---

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Slatefiber woofer, aluminum inverted-dome tweeter with waveguide, front laminar port, Class-D bi-amp, and practical room shelves/auto-standby/multi-input represent solid, contemporary engineering rather than breakthrough tech. [1][2]

---

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Denominator (review target, pair):** **1,258 USD** (629 USD × 2). [3]  
**Cheapest equal-or-better measured comparator (pair):** **JBL 308P MkII**, with reputable **spinorama** data (Klippel NFS via ASR) showing neutral on-axis/LW behavior (preference score 5.56; –3 dB ≈ 42.5 Hz) and higher peak SPL spec; widely available at **259 USD each** → **518 USD pair**. [4][5]

**Calculation:** **518 USD ÷ 1,258 USD = 0.412 → 0.4** (rounded to one decimal).  
**Equivalence note:** 8-inch bi-amped nearfields with room EQ trims and pro I/O; JBL’s neutrality and SPL are independently verified while Focal’s are catalog-based. [2][4][5]

---

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Established pro brand; cabinet is braced MDF with included metal grilles. Warranty information commonly listed as **5-year on drivers / 2-year on amplifier** (region dependent). [2][6]

---

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Design choices (Slatefiber, inverted tweeter/waveguide, front port, sensible EQ/I/O, defeatable standby) are technically coherent and studio-practical. Marketing claims are treated as provisional pending third-party confirmation. [1][2]

---

## Advice

If you want a robust, neutral-leaning 8-inch monitor with **front porting** for flexible placement, **multi-input including RCA**, and **included grilles**, Alpha 80 Evo is a good fit. If you prioritize **independently measured neutrality per dollar**, **JBL 308P MkII** remains a standout value; for deeper sub-bass at level, plan on adding a sub (Focal **Sub One** pairs natively). [4][5][7]
