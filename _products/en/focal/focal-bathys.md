summary: "Focal’s first ANC over-ear aims at audiophiles with a clean, balanced tuning and a handy 24-bit/192 kHz USB-DAC mode, but its value is undermined by cheaper models that match or beat key measured performance."

## Overview

The Focal Bathys is the brand’s 2022 entry into premium wireless ANC headphones, built around 40 mm aluminum-magnesium “M-shape” dynamic drivers. Besides Bluetooth with aptX Adaptive, a standout is USB-DAC mode that accepts up to 24-bit/192 kHz, letting Bathys double as a portable USB headset. Official battery guidance is 30 hours (Bluetooth+ANC), 35 hours (3.5 mm analog), and 42 hours (USB-DAC) depending on mode [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent measurements support largely balanced tonality with characteristic quirks. SoundStage! measurements (GRAS 43AG) note an atypical ~500 Hz rise and elevated 2.5–8.5 kHz energy; THD rises in the bass at very high SPL but remains below audibility in typical use, with active-mode output impedance measured around 1,530 Ω and Bluetooth latency around 285 ms vs ~110 ms in USB-DAC and ~38 ms wired analog [2]. Headphones.com measurements on GRAS 43AG-7 (KB5000) confirm the gentle “Focal-like” mid dip ~900 Hz and generally even bass/mids [3]. RTINGS’ comprehensive lab review finds good overall audio accuracy, strong isolation for travel, and consistent L/R matching, aligning with the above [4]. Taken together, multiple labs converge on performance that is objectively good—if not class-leading for ANC or latency—warranting 0.7.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Bathys implements proven rather than novel tech in 2025 context: Bluetooth 5.x with SBC/AAC/aptX/aptX Adaptive, an in-house 40 mm Al-Mg driver, and an integrated USB-DAC up to 24/192. While the USB-DAC mode is practical, competing flagships now commonly offer hi-res codecs and rich app features; the platform doesn’t push state of the art beyond category norms.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Representative current US street price: **849 USD** [5]. The cheapest equal-or-better alternative on core user-visible functions and measured outcomes is **Sony WH-1000XM5**: class-leading ANC, similar or better mic/battery for typical use, robust app/EQ, and LDAC; any Bathys-unique “USB wired listening” can be matched with a **9 USD** Apple USB-C–to–3.5 mm DAC dongle and the XM5’s included analog cable. **(399.99 + 9.00) ÷ 849 = 0.48 → 0.5** after rounding [6][7]. (RTINGS side-by-side shows ANC/“Noise Isolation” advantage for XM5, with Bathys competitive in tonality and comfort [4][6].)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Focal has established distribution and support, with firmware/app updates available via Focal & Naim app and broad retailer coverage. Build quality and materials are premium; long-term failure-rate data is limited but no systemic issues dominate reputable lab coverage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design prioritizes audible outcomes—solid FR consistency, good isolation, practical USB-DAC—over speculative “hi-fi” claims. Pricing strategy is ambitious versus functionally equivalent ANC peers, but the engineering choices themselves are largely rational and measurement-grounded.

## Advice

If you value a clean, balanced tuning with a tasteful mid dip and want a one-box travel headset that also acts as a simple USB-DAC, Bathys is appealing. If ANC strength, ecosystem features, or value per dollar are priorities, Sony’s WH-1000XM5—or similar flagships—deliver more for less, and can approximate Bathys’ “USB listening” via a 9 USD dongle.
