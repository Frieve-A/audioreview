## Overview

Focal’s Alpha 50 Evo is a 5-inch nearfield monitor featuring the company’s Slatefiber cone and an aluminum inverted-dome tweeter. It is rated at **60W total** Class-D bi-amplification (**35W LF + 25W HF**), with a **frequency response of 45Hz–22kHz (±3dB)** and a **maximum SPL of 101dB peak @1m**. Practical touches include a **front laminar port**, **removable metal grilles**, **XLR/TRS/RCA** inputs, **LF ±6dB / HF ±3dB shelving EQ**, and **auto-standby (~15 minutes)**［1][2]。

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

High-confidence third-party measurements remain limited. Manufacturer figures provide the baseline: **45Hz–22kHz (±3dB)**, **101dB peak @1m**, and **35W + 25W** amplification［1][2]。A Spinorama aggregation exists but is explicitly labeled **low quality**, indicating an estimated **−3dB LF extension ≈43.7Hz** and a preliminary tonality score **0.31** (**4.96 with sub**); treat as indicative only［5]。Pending robust lab data, a neutral **0.5** is appropriate.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Slatefiber (recycled carbon fibers with thermoplastic matrix) and Focal’s inverted-dome tweeter are sound choices. The cabinet uses **15mm (0.6") MDF**, with a **front laminar port**, **protective grilles**, **LF ±6dB / HF ±3dB** shelves, and **auto-standby (~15m)**［1][2]。Engineering is competent and user-oriented, though not groundbreaking.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Street pricing is **758 USD per pair** (Japan reference **92,400円／ペア**)［7][6]。As the **cheapest** widely available equal-or-better option, **JBL 305P MkII** offers a 5" format with **XLR/TRS**, **43Hz–24kHz (−10dB)** bandwidth and **108dB peak SPL**, at **318 USD per pair**［3][8]。  
**Cost-Performance = 318 ÷ 758 = 0.419 → 0.4** (one-decimal rounding).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Standard warranty and availability are positives, along with practical features (front port, grilles)［1][2]。Public long-term reliability datasets are scarce; hence an average **0.5**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design emphasizes practicality and build finesse over demonstrated measured superiority. Given the price and limited independent data, the approach is rational but conservative.

## Advice

If you value **front-ported placement flexibility**, **grille protection**, and Focal’s build, the Alpha 50 Evo is appealing. If you prioritize **measurement-per-dollar**, **JBL 305P MkII** has extensive NFS data and stronger output—while noting port/cabinet resonance considerations seen in testing［4]。Match to your SPL needs, listening distance, and room.
