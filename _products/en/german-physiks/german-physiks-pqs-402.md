## Overview

The PQS-402 is a 2-way omnidirectional loudspeaker employing two carbon-fibre DDD drivers that cover 215Hz–24kHz and a bass system using two 10-inch woofers plus four 8-inch passive radiators. Claimed maximum output is 118dB. Each cabinet weighs 165kg and is recommended for rooms of 30–150m². The DDD diaphragms are hand-built (0.15mm carbon fibre), and the enclosure uses a modular, resonance-controlled construction. [1] Manufacturer specifications list frequency response of 25Hz–24kHz and sensitivity of 88.4dB (1W/1m). [2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There is no comprehensive third-party anechoic data (FR deviation, THD/IMD vs SPL, max-SPL compression) available for the PQS-402. Current evidence is therefore limited to manufacturer specs: 25Hz–24kHz bandwidth, 88.4dB sensitivity, and 118dB maximum output. [2][1] The DDD driver’s unusually wide passband and omnidirectional radiation are technically plausible and well described (0.15mm cone, Walsh-derived operation), [1] but without controlled independent measurements we cannot judge transparency (e.g., ±dB window, distortion vs level) against the speaker criteria. Score is kept at the policy default for “measurement-unknown” with minor upward/downward adjustments withheld pending third-party data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The PQS-402 demonstrates notable technical sophistication: dual wide-band DDD radiators eliminating a midband crossover, a mechanically de-coupled multi-module bass system, cabinet damping strategies, and user-adjustable HF/LF contouring. [1][2] Materials/process details (hand-built 0.15mm carbon-fibre diaphragm; modular, resonance-controlled structure) are advanced, though the underlying Walsh concept is mature. Absence of built-in DSP/room correction or active amplification in the base product constrains the score below the highest tier despite the available factory active-DSP option. [1][2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better):** Ohm **Walsh 4000 Tall** (pair price 7,600 USD = 2 × 3,800 USD). It provides the same user-facing function (omnidirectional Walsh-type radiation) and **manufacturer-specified** full-range response of **26Hz–20kHz (±3dB)**, i.e., essentially matching the PQS-402’s low-end extension within ~4% while covering the audible band. [6]  
**CP calculation:** 7,600 USD ÷ 148,753 USD = **0.051** → rounded to **0.1** (first decimal).

*Note:* The Duevel **Venus** (omnidirectional; widely available at **4,995 GBP**) is cheaper, but its published bandwidth is **40Hz–20kHz**, which does **not** meet the low-frequency equivalence used above, so it is not the basis for CP scoring. [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

German Physiks states a **5-year warranty** and positions the PQS-402 as a long-life product with robust hardware (stainless hardware, modular mass-loaded structure). [1] The architecture is passive/analog (no firmware risk), but the product’s mass, specialized drivers, and boutique nature imply higher handling and repair costs and fewer third-party service options. Global distribution exists, yet is dealer-centric. On balance this is around–slightly-above average support for ultra-high-end passive loudspeakers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design pursues legitimate, measurable goals—omnidirectional dispersion and wideband single-radiator behaviour that minimize crossover artifacts in the midrange. [1][2] However, the passive baseline eschews contemporary, cost-effective routes (factory DSP calibration/room correction, active crossover amps) that often deliver more predictable results in typical rooms. The optional active-DSP path exists but is extra-cost. [3] Overall the philosophy is technically rational yet conservative in system integration relative to state-of-the-art solutions.

## Advice

The PQS-402 is for listeners who specifically want omnidirectional presentation executed with the DDD approach and who accept extreme pricing without third-party measurement disclosure. Audition in your room is essential due to room-interaction sensitivity of omnidirectional designs. If your goal is functionally similar dispersion and full-range bandwidth at far lower cost, the Ohm Walsh 4000 Tall (26Hz–20kHz ±3dB, omnidirectional) is a compelling alternative at about **7,600 USD** per pair. [6] If very low-frequency extension is less critical, Duevel’s Venus offers an even cheaper omni option (40Hz–20kHz) but falls short of the PQS-402’s claimed extension. [4][5]
