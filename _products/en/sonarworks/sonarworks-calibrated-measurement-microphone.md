## Overview

The Sonarworks Calibrated Measurement Microphone is a dedicated measurement microphone designed for SoundID Reference software. Starting from the XREF 20 in 2015, this third-generation product features an electret condenser design weighing 147g with an aluminum housing and omnidirectional characteristics. Each microphone is individually calibrated against ANSI-certified measurement microphones, achieving ±0.9dB measurement accuracy. It includes multi-angle calibration profiles for 0°, 30°, and 90°, with calibration data provided in TXT format for use with third-party systems.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The basic specifications of 20Hz-20kHz frequency response, 200Ω output impedance, and S/N ratio above 70dB are appropriate for a measurement microphone. The ±0.9dB measurement accuracy through individual calibration is within scientifically valid ranges, and quality control through comparison with ANSI-certified reference microphones is reliable. The provision of multi-angle calibration profiles enables improved accuracy in different measurement environments. However, the evaluation is limited by the restricted availability of detailed published measurement data and the lack of specific values for distortion characteristics such as THD+N and IMD.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While the electret condenser design itself represents standard technology, the individual calibration system and profile management technology offer certain technical value. The mechanism of printing unique Profile IDs on each microphone and providing calibration data for multiple angles is practical. However, no industry-leading technology is evident in the basic acoustic conversion technology or capsule design. While the correction technology through integration with Sonarworks software is commendable, the technology level of the microphone unit alone remains at industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The cost-performance is excellent. At a price of 69 USD, it is one of the most affordable options among measurement microphones that include an individual calibration file. For instance, the miniDSP UMIK-1, which also comes with an individual calibration file, is sold for about 200 USD, and the Dayton Audio EMM-6 for about 120 USD. While these products offer functionally equivalent or superior performance, the Sonarworks microphone is available at a significantly lower price. Therefore, being effectively the world's cheapest option in its functional category, its cost-performance is rated a perfect 1.0 according to the review policy.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sonarworks is an established company in the acoustic software field with a well-organized product support system. Considerations in support aspects include quality control through individual microphone calibration, traceability through Profile IDs, and provision of a 21-day SoundID Reference trial. Continuous updates in software aspects, such as support for various macOS versions and multi-channel speaker systems, are also commendable. However, detailed information about long-term durability data and repair systems for the hardware itself is limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The individual calibration approach aimed at improving acoustic measurement accuracy is rational. The design philosophy emphasizing practicality, including simplification of measurement processes through software integration, multi-angle measurement support, and compatibility with third-party systems, is commendable. However, there are questions about the necessity of existing as a dedicated microphone. It is possible that equivalent results could be achieved by applying software correction to existing high-precision measurement microphones, making the rationality of hardware specialization limited. No design advantages proportional to the price difference compared to general-purpose measurement microphones can be confirmed.

## Advice

The Sonarworks Calibrated Measurement Microphone is an excellent choice for users who want to start high-precision acoustic measurements at an affordable price. The ability to get a microphone with an individual calibration file for around 69 USD is a significant advantage. Especially for users of Sonarworks SoundID Reference software, the convenience of seamless integration can be fully appreciated.

If you prioritize cost-performance while demanding reliable measurement accuracy, this product is a strong alternative to more expensive industry-standard microphones like the miniDSP UMIK-1 (approx. 200 USD). Its basic measurement performance is comparable to these higher-priced products, but it allows for significant cost savings. It is a highly recommended product for a wide range of users, from those venturing into serious acoustic measurement for the first time to experienced users looking to easily improve the accuracy of their existing setup.
