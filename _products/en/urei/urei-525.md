## Overview

The UREI 525 Electronic Crossover is a professional analog frequency-dividing network from the early 1980s. It provides third-order Butterworth filters (18 dB/octave), transformer-isolated outputs, and a built-in four-digit frequency counter for accurate crossover setup [1]. UREI was acquired by JBL (Harman International) in 1984, and the brand was subsequently absorbed into JBL Professional’s lineup [5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Manufacturer specifications report ±1 dB frequency response (20 Hz–20 kHz) and <0.5% THD (30 Hz–15 kHz at maximum rated output). The design is unity gain (±1 dB), with maximum output of +20 dBm into 600 Ω and output noise below –90 dBm (15.7 kHz bandwidth) [1]. By contemporary standards these distortion/noise figures are weak: current digital crossovers achieve orders-of-magnitude lower THD+N (e.g., DCX2496: 0.007% THD+N, ~109 dB analog-in-to-out dynamic range, manufacturer data) [2]. Given the clearly problematic THD for an electronics device and lack of independent third-party measurements for the 525, we assign a low score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The 525 implements third-order Butterworth filtering with recessed screwdriver-set crossover controls and a unique built-in frequency counter (1 Hz resolution, ±0.1% accuracy; external counter input supported) [1]. While well-engineered for its time (including transformer-isolated outputs for pro interfacing), it lacks modern DSP functions such as flexible filter types/slopes, parametric EQ, delay/phase alignment, and preset management found in today’s loudspeaker management systems.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Used-market pricing for the UREI 525 is about 1,568 USD [4]. A cheapest equal-or-better alternative is the Behringer DCX2496, a 3-in/6-out digital loudspeaker manager with 24-bit/96 kHz processing, multiple filter types (up to 48 dB/oct), parametric EQ, delays and limiters. Manufacturer specs indicate 0.007% THD+N and ~109–112 dB dynamic range [2], clearly surpassing the 525’s analog performance. Current US street price: 339 USD [3].  
CP calculation: **339 ÷ 1568 = 0.216**, rounded to **0.2**.

(Equivalence note: DCX2496 matches/exceeds user-visible crossover functionality and provides materially superior measured distortion/noise performance [2][3].)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The 525 is long discontinued and the UREI brand was absorbed into JBL after the 1984 acquisition; there is no official warranty or factory service pathway today [5]. The simple analog construction and transformer-coupled outputs aid robustness and serviceability, but repairs rely on third-party technicians and aging components. No firmware applies.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Emphasizing rugged analog interfacing and a handy frequency counter made sense in the 1980s. However, the absence of modern DSP features and the comparatively high distortion versus today’s loudspeaker managers indicate a design direction that no longer leads to transparent performance or rational cost effectiveness.

## Advice

The 525 appeals to collectors or studios pursuing historically faithful rigs. For new systems needing precision, flexibility, and transparent metrics, modern digital loudspeaker management (e.g., DCX2496) offers substantially better measured performance and workflow at a fraction of the price [2][3][4].
