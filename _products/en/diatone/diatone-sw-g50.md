## Overview

The Diatone SW-G50 is a 25cm car audio subwoofer manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric. It features the company's proprietary NCV (Natural Composite Vibration) diaphragm material and a powerful magnetic circuit, claiming 20Hz reproduction capability even in compact sealed enclosures of approximately 10 liters (per manufacturer materials). It is designed to create a 3-way system when combined with DS-G50 speakers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Detailed measurement data is difficult to obtain, making it impossible to verify specific performance indicators such as frequency response, THD, and S/N ratio. While manufacturer materials claim 20Hz reproduction and compact enclosure compatibility, no third-party measurement data was found to support these claims. Without objective data comparable to modern car subwoofer transparent level standards (THD 0.1% or below, S/N ratio 90dB or above), the scientific validity remains unclear.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of NCV diaphragm technology and a powerful magnetic circuit demonstrates certain technical efforts. The NCV material, which purportedly combines titanium-like propagation speed with paper-like internal damping, represents a technically interesting approach. However, it is unclear how advanced these technologies are compared to current industry standards. The design goal of low-frequency reproduction in compact enclosures is technically rational.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Per the policy, we compare against the globally lowest-priced product that is equal or better in features and (to the extent published) performance. We adopt JL Audio 10W6v2 as the comparator due to equivalent driver diameter (25 cm), 600 W RMS handling, Fs=28.5 Hz, and suitability for compact sealed enclosures [2]. Using an observed low price of approximately 333 USD for the 10W6v2 and approximately 367 USD used market price for the SW-G50, the ratio 333 รท 367 = 0.91 yields a cost-performance score of 0.9.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a product from major manufacturer Mitsubishi Electric, basic quality control can be expected. However, since it is currently a discontinued product, there is uncertainty regarding the continuity of official support and parts supply. It is judged to be at the average support system level for the car audio industry. Long-term repair support remains unclear.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design goal of low-frequency reproduction in compact enclosures is rational for automotive environments. The approach to improving acoustic characteristics through NCV diaphragm technology is theoretically sound. However, it remains unclear how much these technical efforts contribute to achieving transparent level performance. While the direction of performance improvement based on scientific grounds is recognized, demonstration of effectiveness is lacking.

## Advice

Due to insufficient detailed measurement data, we recommend careful comparison with competing products that have publicly available third-party measurements. Unless you find special value in the Mitsubishi Electric brand or have interest in NCV diaphragm technology, selecting alternatives with richer published measurements in the same price range would be rational. If purchasing, ensure that professional support for enclosure design is available.
