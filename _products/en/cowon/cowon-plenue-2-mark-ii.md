## Overview

The Cowon Plenue 2 Mark II is a dedicated digital audio player positioned as a premium audiophile device. Released in 2018 as an upgrade to the original Plenue 2, the Mark II doubled internal storage to 256GB and modestly extended battery life (around 10.5 hours typical), while retaining Cowon’s JetEffect processing and an AKM AK4497EQ DAC. It focuses purely on local playback without wireless connectivity. As of this writing, new retail availability appears limited; most units surface through secondary markets at premium pricing [2][6].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent third-party measurements of the original Plenue 2 (non-Mark II) report SNR ≈ 123 dB, THD+N ≈ 0.0005% (≈ –104.5 dB), stereo crosstalk ≈ –142 dB, and output impedance ≈ 0.56 Ω—fully within transparent thresholds for human hearing [1]. Public third-party lab data for the Mark II specifically were not found; however, the measured values for the closely related Plenue 2 and Cowon’s published specifications for the Mark II align in magnitude, so we treat the above as a representative baseline pending Mark II–specific lab data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Use of the AKM AK4497EQ with dual TCXO timing, Cowon’s JetEffect 7 DSP, selectable 32-bit digital filters, and AI features (AI Volume/Shuffle/JetEffect) reflects solid high-end engineering of its era. The design, however, omits Android, Wi-Fi/BT, and streaming app support that are standard in contemporary DAPs, constraining practical capability despite the strong core audio path.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

We must compare across classes/approaches to the **cheapest** solution with equal-or-better functions and measured performance. A **smartphone + transparent USB dongle DAC + microSD (to match 256GB local storage)** achieves that at far lower cost:

- **Motorola moto g play (2024)** (Android; microSD support): **149.99 USD** [4][5]  
- **E1DA 9038D6K dongle DAC** (independently shown to deliver transparent-class performance): **112.49 USD** [2][3]  
- **256GB microSD card** (to match on-device storage class): **26.98 USD** [5]

Total cheapest equivalent: **149.99 + 112.49 + 26.98 = 289.46 USD**.  
CP calculation (target price is always the denominator): **289.46 USD ÷ 1730 USD = 0.167 → score 0.2**.

**Equivalence note (minimal requirement):** The combo provides local playback with ≥256GB storage, app/streaming support, and **measured audio performance equal-or-better** (e.g., THD+N and SNR at transparent levels via the E1DA dongle) [1][2][3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Build quality appears robust (CNC aluminum chassis; mature firmware). The model’s current sales footprint is limited and largely via secondary listings [6]. While Cowon still hosts product/firmware pages for legacy Plenue devices [2][6][7], long-term parts/service availability for a legacy DAP is uncertain, which constrains support confidence.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Prioritizing an offline, RF-quiet, single-purpose player is technically coherent for niche use, and the measured transparency validates the engineering. Practically, though, transparent playback is now commodity-level with inexpensive dongles; a budget Android phone plus a high-performance USB DAC delivers similar or better fidelity with vastly broader functionality at a fraction of the price.

## Advice

If you specifically need a standalone, offline player with Cowon’s UI/JetEffect and value the build/ergonomics, the Plenue 2 Mark II can satisfy that niche. For most users, however, **a phone + transparent USB DAC** (e.g., E1DA 9038D6K) or a modern Android DAP will deliver equivalent fidelity, far more capability, and **dramatically better value**. Given current market availability and the steep opportunity cost, we recommend exhausting those alternatives first.
