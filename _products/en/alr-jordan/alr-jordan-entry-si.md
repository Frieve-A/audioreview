## Overview

The ALR Jordan Entry Si is a compact bookshelf speaker from the now-defunct German manufacturer ALR Jordan. Released in 2004, it was developed as a successor to the Entry S when the original tweeter was discontinued. The Entry Si features an 11.5cm metal cone woofer developed through collaboration between ALR technology and E.J. Jordan's research, paired with a 2.5cm soft dome tweeter. The original company went bankrupt in 2000, was revived as ALR Acoustics, but was ultimately liquidated in 2013, making this a discontinued product with no manufacturer support available.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Entry Si achieves problematic-level performance in several key measurements. Frequency response of 65-28,000 Hz falls short of transparent standards, particularly in low-frequency extension where 65 Hz represents borderline adequate performance for small bookshelf speakers. The tweeter extends to 28 kHz (0-3dB), providing acceptable high-frequency extension. Critical measurement data including THD, S/N ratio, and dynamic range is completely unavailable from both manufacturer and third-party sources. The small 11.5cm woofer inherently limits low-frequency performance, and without proper distortion measurements, scientifically audible benefits cannot be verified.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Entry Si employs mature metal cone technology derived from E.J. Jordan's 1970s-1980s research, representing solid but dated engineering. While the integration of ALR and Jordan expertise demonstrates competent design ownership, the technology lacks modern innovations. The passive crossover design using T-type resistors and purely analog approach represents outdated technology compared to contemporary speakers featuring DSP, active crossovers, and digital integration. No evidence exists of cutting-edge technology or innovations that would be desirable for other manufacturers to adopt.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Current market pricing for used Entry Si speakers ranges around 130 USD based on recent sales data. The Sony SS-CS5 provides equivalent-or-better functionality with superior frequency response (53Hz-50kHz vs 65-28kHz), similar power handling (100W) and sensitivity (86-87dB), plus three-way design with super tweeter for enhanced high-frequency response. Equipped with comparable functions and superior measured performance in frequency response range. Current Sony SS-CS5 market price is approximately 168 USD per pair.

CP = 130 รท 168 = 0.77, rounded to 0.8.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

ALR Jordan declared bankruptcy in 2000, was revived as ALR Acoustics, but was ultimately liquidated in 2013, resulting in complete absence of manufacturer support, warranty coverage, or repair services. This represents the worst possible scenario for reliability and support, as owners have no recourse for failures or defects. The Entry Si, released in 2004, came from a company that had already experienced bankruptcy, making long-term reliability questionable with no available support infrastructure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design philosophy emphasizes traditional metal cone technology and German craftsmanship, representing a conservative approach based on mature technology rather than scientific advancement. Limited measurement data transparency and high cost not justified by superior performance compared to cheaper alternatives indicate poor cost optimization. The focus on historical E.J. Jordan research and traditional passive crossover design lacks innovation or adoption of modern technologies that could improve function and measured performance.

## Advice

The ALR Jordan Entry Si presents a mixed value proposition for modern consumers. While offering no manufacturer support and limited low-frequency extension, the reasonable used market price around 130 USD makes them competitively priced against alternatives like the Sony SS-CS5 (168 USD). However, the Sony provides superior frequency response, three-way design, and full manufacturer support. For collectors of German engineering or metal cone technology, the Entry Si may hold appeal, but contemporary alternatives from active manufacturers provide better performance with ongoing support.
