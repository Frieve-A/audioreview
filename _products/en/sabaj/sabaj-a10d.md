## Overview

The Sabaj A10D 2022 is a desktop DAC and headphone amplifier built around dual ESS ES9038Q2M chips in a balanced configuration. It provides USB-C, optical, and coaxial digital inputs plus Bluetooth 5.0 (LDAC/aptX HD/AAC), balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA line outputs, and both 6.35 mm (SE) and 4.4 mm (balanced) headphone jacks [2]. The goal is high measured fidelity and practical connectivity at 299 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent testing at Audio Science Review confirms that the A10D's performance reaches audibly transparent levels for both DAC and headphone outputs [1]. Manufacturer-published key figures are: DAC THD+N 0.00008% (-121 dB), headphone out THD+N 0.00012% (-118 dB), dynamic range/SNR up to 126 dB, RCA 2 Vrms and XLR 4 Vrms line levels, and headphone power around 1 W into 32 Ω [2]. Architecture details include XMOS XU208 USB and multiple OPA1612 op-amps in the analog stage [2][3]. These numbers exceed common transparency thresholds; note that LDAC/aptX HD are high-bitrate but still lossy BT codecs [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Dual ES9038Q2M in differential mode, XMOS XU208 for up to 32-bit/768 kHz PCM and DSD512, and a fully featured I/O set reflect competent, current-generation design rather than novel research. The analog stage uses OPA1612 op-amps, with balanced line and headphone paths implemented cleanly [2][3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Current price of review target:** 299 USD.

**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** SMSL C200 (DAC/amp with balanced line out, 4.4 mm/6.35 mm headphone outs, Bluetooth with LDAC; line THD+N -120 dB, DR 126 dB on TRS; manufacturer) at **219 USD** [5][6][7].

**Equivalence note (user perspective):** C200 offers the same key functions (USB/optical/coax/BT, balanced line out, integrated headphone amp) and comparable measured performance (line THD+N and dynamic range within spec of the A10D) [5][6][7]. Connector style (XLR vs TRS) is not user-visible performance.

**Calculation (USD basis for consistency):**  
219 USD ÷ 299 USD = **0.732** → rounded to **0.7**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Warranty for new Sabaj products is **one year** (two years in Europe) and service is typically dealer-mediated [9][10]. Firmware/driver support exists for the XMOS USB interface where applicable. Overall hardware design uses proven components; direct global service infrastructure is limited outside Asia.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The A10D prioritizes measurable fidelity and practical I/O over cosmetic excess. Balanced signal paths, sensible op-amp selection, and modern digital interfaces are used to achieve transparent performance at modest cost, aligning engineering effort with audible outcomes.

## Advice

If you need a single-box DAC/amp with balanced line out, competent headphone power, and Bluetooth (LDAC), the A10D is a strong choice at 299 USD. If maximizing price-to-performance is paramount and XLR connectors specifically are not required, the SMSL C200 delivers equivalent functionality and specs for less. If you want advanced DSP/EQ and a higher-end UI, consider stepping up to devices like JDS Element IV at a higher price point.
