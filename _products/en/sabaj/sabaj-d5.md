## Overview

Sabaj D5 is a desktop DAC and headphone amplifier combination featuring the flagship ES9038PRO DAC chip from ESS Technology. Supporting high-resolution audio up to 32-bit/768kHz PCM and DSD512, the D5 provides both single-ended and balanced outputs with 1912mW power at 32Ω. Digital inputs are USB, optical, coaxial, and I2S via HDMI; line outputs are balanced XLR and single-ended RCA; headphone outputs are 4-pin XLR (balanced) and 6.35 mm. Remote control is included. Sabaj positions this as a high-performance desktop solution targeting transparent sound reproduction.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Sabaj D5 achieves exceptional measured performance according to Audio Science Review testing [1]. SINAD measures 107 dB when cold, rising to 119 dB when warmed up, exceeding the 105 dB transparency threshold. Worst‑case distortion is around −115 dB, well below the 0.01% transparent level. Dynamic range is extremely low‑noise; published specs list about 127 dB (XLR) and 124 dB (RCA) [2][3], consistent with the very quiet DNR observed in ASR’s measurement plots. The implementation shows the characteristic ESS IMD hump at mid levels, a known behavior of some ES9038PRO designs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The D5 employs industry-standard high-performance components including the flagship ES9038PRO DAC chip and XMOS XU-208 USB interface. The analog section uses OPA1612 operational amplifiers from Texas Instruments. While these represent proven, high-quality components, the overall design follows conventional implementation approaches without significant innovation. The reconstruction filter options and balanced/single-ended output stages demonstrate competent engineering but do not advance beyond established industry practices. The technology level represents solid execution of established designs rather than groundbreaking innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Using a verified price for an equivalent combo DAC/amp with balanced line out and excellent measured performance, SMSL C200 is listed at USD 219.00 [4]. The D5’s reference new price was USD 470.00 on Amazon at release [1] (EU retail later listed at 449.00 € and is now discontinued [3]). Thus: 219 ÷ 470 = 0.466 → rounded to 0.5. C200 also adds Bluetooth and remains sufficient for the vast majority of headphones, while D5 offers higher peak balanced headphone power (1.912 W @ 32 Ω) and I2S input.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Sabaj Audio operates as an established Chinese audio manufacturer with standard warranty coverage and support infrastructure. The company maintains official distribution channels and provides firmware updates when applicable. No significant reliability issues have been widely reported for the D5 model. The build quality appears consistent with industry standards for this product category. However, support responsiveness and long-term reliability remain at average industry levels without exceptional warranty terms or extended support periods.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The D5 demonstrates a rational approach focused on achieving transparent, measurable performance improvements. Component selection prioritizes proven high‑performance parts capable of reaching audibly transparent levels. The design emphasizes objective measurements, targeting minimal distortion/noise. Multiple digital filters, I2S input, and balanced outputs serve practical functionality rather than marketing. Overall it reflects scientifically sound engineering aimed at audible transparency.

## Advice

The Sabaj D5 delivers excellent measured performance and transparent sound suitable for demanding headphone applications. With CP calculated against SMSL C200 (USD 219.00), choose the D5 when you need its higher balanced headphone power, I2S input, or XLR headphone output; otherwise, C200 provides similar objective performance at a lower price. The D5 is well‑suited to higher‑impedance or lower‑sensitivity headphones, delivering up to 1.912 W at 32 Ω from the balanced output.
