## Overview

The Panasonic SC-PMX900-S is a CD stereo system with a "Tuned by Technics" specification. It employs a full digital amplifier and low-noise power design, and provides CD playback plus Bluetooth, AirPlay 2/Chromecast built-in, Wi‑Fi/LAN, USB‑B (PC input), and optical digital input. It supports DSD 2.8/5.6MHz and AIFF/FLAC/WAV up to 192kHz/24‑bit. The bundled speakers are rated at 120W (60W+60W, JEITA) maximum practical output [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

No independent third-party measurements (frequency response, THD+N, SNR, etc.) were found. We therefore provisionally document manufacturer numbers: 120W (60W+60W, JEITA) maximum practical output; bundled speakers rated 41Hz–100kHz (−16dB)/45Hz–90kHz (−10dB) with 82dB/W @1m sensitivity; formats up to 192kHz/24‑bit AIFF/FLAC/WAV and DSD 2.8/5.6MHz via USB/PC/Wi‑Fi; I/O includes USB‑A/USB‑B, optical input, analog input, Bluetooth 4.2, and AirPlay 2/Chromecast built‑in [1][2]. In the absence of third‑party data, audible transparency cannot be verified at this time.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The system integrates a full digital amplifier with a low‑noise power design and handles DSD 2.8/5.6MHz and 192kHz/24‑bit PCM, plus network features (AirPlay 2/Chromecast built‑in) in a single unit [1][2]. Public lab measurements are scarce, and no model‑specific breakthroughs are documented, so the score remains moderate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Representative market price: 280 USD (confirmed via Amazon JP [3], converted at ECB rate on the review date [4]). Considering user‑facing functions provided by this finished system—CD integration, Wi‑Fi, AirPlay 2, Chromecast built‑in, USB‑B (PC input), optical input, and DSD 2.8/5.6MHz playback—no cheaper equivalent‑or‑better finished product was found at the time of review. Per the definition, CP is set to 1.0 (no cheaper equivalent exists).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Panasonic provides standard consumer warranty and support. The SC‑PMX900 is primarily distributed in Japan, so regional support access may be limited. Given the category, frequent firmware updates are not expected. The score reflects industry‑average expectations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

An all‑in‑one approach with CD, network features, and PC input minimizes add‑ons and yields practical versatility [1][2]. However, published measurement transparency is limited, and alternatives like smartphone + external DAC compete at similar cost. The score remains moderate.

## Advice

The SC‑PMX900 targets users wanting an integrated CD/network/PC‑input solution. If third‑party measurements are essential, wait for public data or consider alternatives with published lab results. Before purchase, confirm regional availability/support and verify that required features (AirPlay 2/Chromecast built‑in, USB‑B/optical input, DSD support) meet your needs [1][2].
