## Overview

Belden 9497 is a 16 AWG stranded high-conductivity copper speaker cable with PVC insulation, manufactured by Belden Inc., a US-based company established in 1902 specializing in industrial and broadcast cables. The cable features a 2-conductor twisted-pair design with tinned copper conductors (19×29 AWG stranding) and has gained recognition in vintage audio circles as an affordable option for tube amplifier applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Belden 9497 demonstrates adequate electrical performance within its design limitations. Manufacturer specifications list DC resistance of 4.27 Ω per 1000 ft (≈14 Ω/km) and a maximum current of 7.1 A per conductor at 25 °C [1]. For a typical 10 ft run the round-trip series resistance is ~0.085 Ω, which is negligible against common 8 Ω loads. The current technical data sheet does not provide a capacitance value [1]. At 16 AWG, conductor cross-section is sufficient for most moderate-power home audio runs. As an unshielded twisted pair, it offers minimal EMI protection relative to shielded alternatives.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The cable employs conventional twisted-pair construction with standard PVC insulation and tinned copper conductors. While the 19×29 stranding provides reasonable flexibility, the overall design reflects mature industrial cable practice with no notable innovations in dielectric materials, geometry, or conductor processing.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Review-target market price: **1.49 USD per foot**.  
Cheapest equal-or-better comparator found: **Monoprice 16 AWG Oxygen-Free Pure Bare Copper Speaker Wire, 100 ft** at **52.99 USD** → **0.5299 USD per foot** [2].  
**Equivalence note:** same 16 AWG gauge and unshielded speaker-wire function; pure bare copper (OFC) offers equal-or-lower DC resistance than tinned copper at the same gauge [1][3].  
**Calculation:** 0.5299 USD ÷ 1.49 USD = **0.355… → 0.4** (rounded to one decimal place per rules).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Belden maintains established manufacturing standards and publishes an official technical data sheet with electrical and compliance information, indicating stable industrial supply and documentation [1]. Warranty and support are typical of an industrial supplier; consumer-focused audio support is minimal.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design prioritizes robust, economical construction over maximizing audio-centric parameters. PVC dielectric and unshielded geometry are serviceable but not optimized for lowest dielectric loss or EMI immunity. From a transparency-first perspective, the approach is functional rather than ambitious.

## Advice

Use Belden 9497 for budget-conscious runs of modest length and power where installation robustness matters and EMI exposure is low. For longer runs or electrically demanding systems, a heavier gauge (e.g., 14 AWG) or lower-loss dielectric/shielded designs may reduce series resistance and improve noise immunity.
