## Overview

Belden 88770 is a CMP plenum-rated multi-conductor cable: three 18 AWG (19×30) tinned copper strands with FEP insulation and FEP jacket, an overall Beldfoil® shield (100% coverage), and a 20 AWG drain. Key specs include 300 V rating, −70 °C to +200 °C operating range, and conductor colors black/white/red. The closest non-plenum equivalent is Belden 8770 (PE/PVC, CM).[1][2][6][7]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Headline electrical figures: conductor DCR 6.4 Ω/1000 ft; capacitance 54 pF/ft (conductor–conductor) and 96 pF/ft (to shield).[6] A 10 m (≈33 ft) run totals ≈1.78 nF; with a 1 kΩ source, the RC cutoff is ≈89 kHz (≈890 kHz at 100 Ω), i.e., well above the audible band. Thus audible impact for typical home line-level lengths is expected to be minimal. We found no independent measurements demonstrating audible superiority of 88770 over other shielded 3-conductor cables.[1][6][7]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The construction—3×18 AWG stranded with Beldfoil® + drain and FEP dielectric/jacket—is a mature industrial recipe. It offers environmental robustness (wide temperature, plenum rating) rather than audio-specific innovations or measurable performance advantages in typical listening scenarios.[1][6]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Representative market price is **5.22 USD/ft**.[3] A functionally and electrically equivalent-or-better alternative is **Belden 8770** (same 18 AWG×3 conductors with Beldfoil®/drain, 300 V, CM) at **2.49 USD/ft**.[2][4][7]

**Calculation:** 2.49 ÷ 5.22 = **0.477… → 0.5** (rounded to one decimal).  
Meaning: cheaper equivalent means exist; 88770’s price premium mainly buys FEP/CMP compliance.[2][3][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Belden’s documentation and distribution are solid for industrial markets. 88770 clearly specifies CMP, −70 to +200 °C, and other suitability notes (indoor/outdoor, oil/sunlight resistance). No audio-specific measurement guarantees are advertised.[1][6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

For installations without plenum or high-temperature requirements, positioning FEP/CMP as an “audio upgrade” lacks scientific basis. Notably, the non-plenum 8770 shows lower conductor-to-conductor capacitance (24 pF/ft vs 54 pF/ft), which is not a disadvantage for long runs. Absent special environment constraints, the cheaper non-plenum option is more rational.[6][7]

## Advice

Choose 88770 when you must meet plenum code or face high-temperature/chemical environments. For ordinary audio interconnect runs, **Belden 8770** (or similar 3-conductor shielded cables) delivers equivalent transparency at far lower cost. Only in edge cases—very long runs with unusually high source impedance—might cable capacitance be a practical concern.[2][4][6][7]
