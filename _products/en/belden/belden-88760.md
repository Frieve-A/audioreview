## Overview

Belden 88760 is a plenum-rated, 18 AWG single-pair shielded control cable using stranded tinned copper (19×30), FEP insulation and FEP jacket, with an overall Beldfoil® shield and 20 AWG tinned drain. Key specs include 29 Ω nominal characteristic impedance, nominal capacitance 51 pF/ft (conductor-to-conductor) and 97 pF/ft (conductor-to-shield), conductor DCR 5.5 Ω/1000 ft, and operating temperature −70 °C to +200 °C (CMP). The non-plenum counterpart is 8760 (PE/PVC). [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

From the manufacturer data, 88760’s nominal capacitance (51 pF/ft C-C, 97 pF/ft C-to-shield) and low DCR fall within normal ranges for line-level analog interconnects. With typical runs (e.g., 2–10 ft) and common source/load impedances, these values are not expected to produce audible deviations when compared with other shielded twisted-pair cables of similar gauge. No independent third-party audio measurements demonstrating audible superiority over standard audio cables were identified; therefore, we treat the catalog specs as sufficient for basic transparency but not evidence of audible improvement. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The construction—tinned-copper 18 AWG twisted pair, aluminum/polyester Beldfoil® shield (100% coverage) with drain, FEP dielectric and jacket—is mature industrial cable technology. It provides chemical/thermal robustness for control/instrumentation but introduces no audio-specific design innovations, algorithms, or demonstrably superior electro-acoustic performance compared with conventional PE/PVC audio/control pairs. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Current US market price observed for 88760 is **3.81 USD/ft** (cut-to-length). [3]  
A truly equivalent-or-better alternative for audio use is **Belden 8760** (same 18 AWG shielded twisted pair with Beldfoil®/drain; lower nominal C-C capacitance 27.2 pF/ft, which is equal-or-better for line-level applications), available at **1.81 USD/ft**. [2][4]

**Calculation (policy formula):** 1.81 ÷ 3.81 = **0.475… → 0.5** (rounded to one decimal).  
Interpretation: cheaper equivalent-or-better options clearly exist; 88760’s plenum/FEP features drive cost without adding audible performance for typical audio use.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Belden maintains comprehensive datasheets, broad distribution, and consistent industrial quality. The CMP plenum rating and FEP materials provide excellent environmental margins (−70 °C to +200 °C) far exceeding consumer audio needs. Warranty/support are oriented to industrial deployments; there is no audio-specific validation program. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Positioning a CMP plenum control cable as an “audio upgrade” lacks scientific basis. Compared with non-plenum, PE/PVC analog control/audio pairs (e.g., 8760), 88760 offers environmental robustness rather than measurable audio performance gains; capacitance is in fact higher than 8760’s nominal figure. Selling it at a steep premium for typical audio use is not rational when equal-or-better measured electrical performance is cheaper. [1][2][4]

## Advice

Use 88760 when you **must** meet plenum code or extreme temperature/chemical requirements; in such cases its FEP/FEP build is appropriate. For home/pro audio interconnects where plenum/hi-temp is unnecessary, select Belden 8760 or comparable shielded twisted-pair with low capacitance to minimize cost without sacrificing transparency.
