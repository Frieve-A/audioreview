## Overview

The MOTU 828 (2024) is the latest model of the company's 1U rackmount audio interface. As the latest version of the 828 series that has been widely used in the professional audio industry since the first generation debuted in 2001, it features 28 inputs and 32 outputs with abundant I/O, ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC technology, and USB 3.0 connectivity. With a robust construction using a 5kg metal chassis and visual metering capabilities via a 3.9-inch TFT display, it is designed for use in both studio and live applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measured performance is excellent. The microphone inputs achieve THD+N of -113 dB and analog outputs -114 dB, reaching transparent levels well below 0.01%. Dynamic range shows 120 dB for microphone inputs and 123 dB for analog outputs, exceeding the 105 dB transparency threshold. Equivalent Input Noise (EIN) is excellent at -129 dBu, and round-trip latency at 96 kHz is approximately 1.6ms, enabling practical real-time monitoring. The combination of ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC and high-performance A/D converters achieves transparent levels across virtually all metrics.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The unit employs high-quality components that meet current industry standards, including the ESS Sabre 9026PRO DAC for 8-channel 32-bit DA conversion, and digitally controlled BB PGA2500 preamps. Practical feature integration includes 5 Gbps bandwidth through USB 3.0 connectivity, 24-input digital mixer with built-in DSP effects, and direct iPad compatibility. However, rather than innovative proprietary technology, this represents a well-executed combination of existing excellent components, with limited breakthrough technology or novelty that would significantly impact the industry.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The 995 USD price point achieves the world's lowest price in the 28+ input audio interface market. Competing products include the Arturia AudioFuse 16Rig (1,079-1,299 USD, 26 inputs/28 outputs), Cranborne Audio 500R8 (1,799 USD, 28 inputs/30 outputs), and RME Fireface UFX III (3,000+ USD), all of which are priced higher than this product. Among current products meeting the 28-input, 32-output specification, this product is effectively the most affordable, resulting in a cost-performance score of 1.0. No lower-priced alternatives exist with equivalent or superior functionality and measured performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

MOTU is a company with a long track record in the professional audio market, and the 828 series is a established product line with over 20 years of history. The robust construction using a 5kg metal chassis demonstrates quality capable of withstanding professional use. It supports macOS, Windows, and iOS, with class-compliant design enabling driver-free operation. However, compared to products from emerging manufacturers, it does not offer particularly superior warranty conditions or innovative support systems, maintaining a level that exceeds industry average. While there is a track record for long-term reliability, no outstanding features are evident.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design adopts a rational approach focused on improving measurable audio quality metrics. Scientific evidence-based design decisions are evident throughout, including the selection of components with objectively excellent performance such as the ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC and high-performance A/D converters, precise gain management through digital control, and low latency achievement. The feature set is optimized for modern digital audio workflows, including 24-bit 192 kHz support, abundant digital I/O, and real-time processing via built-in DSP. The approach of eliminating occult elements and pursuing audio quality improvements verifiable through measured results is highly commendable.

## Advice

The MOTU 828 (2024) is technically excellent and achieves the world's lowest price for audio interfaces with 28+ inputs. For applications requiring this input count, the price advantage is clear. Compared to competitors like the Arturia AudioFuse 16Rig (1,079-1,299 USD) and Cranborne Audio 500R8 (1,799 USD), it offers superior balance of functionality, measured performance, and price. While further cost reduction is possible by selecting products with fewer inputs when 28 inputs are not required, this represents the optimal choice for applications requiring this specification. Features including USB 3.0 connectivity, ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC, and robust metal chassis provide excellent value considering the price. It is recommended as an investment for long-term use.
