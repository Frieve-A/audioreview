## Overview

The MOTU M2 is a USB-C audio interface released in 2019. It achieved groundbreaking high audio quality in its price range through the ESS Technology Sabre32 Ultra DAC. Despite its 2in2out configuration, it features a full-color display enabling visual input/output level confirmation. MOTU is a veteran audio manufacturer that has been around since the 1980s with proven professional market experience.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC achieves THD+N < -110 dB (line output) and dynamic range of 120 dBA (line output). The microphone input EIN of -129 dBu represents excellent performance in this price range. It supports 192kHz/24bit sampling, providing measurement performance well beyond the audible range. However, the performance far exceeds the human auditory transparency threshold, limiting practical audio quality improvement effects.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC was advanced for its time, but is now widely adopted across many products. Rather than proprietary design, performance improvement comes from selecting high-quality DAC chips. The visual feedback via full-color display is practical, but technical innovation is limited. The preamp circuit design is also at a standard level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Against the current price of approximately 240 USD, competing products in the same price range include SSL 2 (110.5-112dB, THD+N <0.0012%), PreSonus Studio 24C (108-115dB, THD+N 0.002%), and Steinberg UR22C (102-106dB, THD+N 0.0015%). However, the MOTU M2's 120dB (ESS Sabre32 Ultra) and THD+N -110dB measurement performance significantly exceeds all of these, representing industry-leading standards. No 2in2out product with equivalent measurement performance exists at this price point. The performance far exceeding transparency levels achieved through ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC adoption demonstrates clear technical superiority and provides value commensurate with its price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

MOTU has a strong track record as a veteran manufacturer, with product reliability at a high level. The domestic authorized dealer provides 3-year warranty, and firmware updates are continuously provided. USB-C connector adoption ensures future compatibility. However, repair support may require overseas shipping in some cases, making it not entirely comprehensive.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The rational design achieves reliable audio quality improvement through high-quality DAC chip adoption. The design philosophy prioritizing practicality, such as USB-C adoption and visual feedback via full-color display, is commendable. However, the high cost due to audio-dedicated enclosure becomes questionable when considering advances in smartphone built-in DACs. We live in an era where sufficient audio quality can be achieved with cheaper general-purpose chipsets.

## Advice

The MOTU M2 achieves industry-leading measurement performance at its price point, representing exceptional value. No competing 2in2out products exist with equivalent 120dB dynamic range and THD+N -110dB specifications. The clear technical advantages provided by ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC implementation justify the investment for users prioritizing measurement performance. While emerging brand support continuity considerations exist, the current overwhelming technical and price advantages make this an excellent choice. For measurement-focused users seeking optimal performance, this represents the definitive option at this price point.
