summary: "2-in/2-out USB-C interface using ESS Sabre32 Ultra. Third-party tests confirm ~120 dB(A) line-out dynamic range and very low distortion; loopback DR around −112 dB indicates strong real-world round-trip performance. Excellent meters and loopback yield high practical value."

## Overview

The MOTU M2 is a compact 2-in/2-out USB-C audio interface introduced in 2019. It became notable for measured output performance unusual at its price, thanks in part to an ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC. It adds a color display for clear input/output metering and offers loopback for streaming/recording workflows.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Manufacturer specs** list **120 dB(A) dynamic range** and **≈−110 dB THD+N** for balanced line outputs, and mic input **EIN −129 dBu** [1][2].  
**Independent measurements**:  
- **ASR**’s bench tests of the M2 report excellent DAC performance for the price; their separate **loopback** thread shows **round-trip dynamic range ≈−112 dB** (DAC→ADC), consistent with strong practical capture quality and indicating the ADC stage sets the ceiling for loopback DR [3][4].  
- Additional third-party reviews (lab-style) broadly corroborate MOTU’s output claims for the main outs in the ~120 dB(A) range [3].  

Takeaway: multiple sources agree the outputs are audibly transparent; the ADC/mic path is likewise competitive in this segment, with loopback DR figures aligning with expectations for clean, modern 24-bit recording.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Performance derives from competent implementation and quality converter silicon rather than unique IP. The color metering and stable USB-C operation are practical, but the underlying conversion and preamp approaches are common in 2023–2025 designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Street price (US)**: **199.95 USD** [2]. We must compare against the **lowest-priced models that deliver comparable function *and* measured performance** (not just same “class”).  
- **Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (4th Gen)**: independent testing confirms very competent conversion with **manufacturer-stated 120 dB(A) line-out DR** and **≈−109 dB THD+N**; price typically **199.99 USD** [5][6].  
- **SSL 2 MKII**: improved over MKI but **line-out DR 117 dB(A)**, slightly below M2/2i2; pricing similar [7].

Because an equal-performance alternative (2i2 4th Gen) exists at essentially the same price, M2’s value is **strong** rather than unmatched. Its superior metering and built-in loopback keep it near the top for creators who benefit from these features.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

MOTU has a longstanding reputation for solid drivers and firmware support. Build quality is robust. Depending on region, repair logistics can involve overseas handling, which may add time/cost.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Prioritizing measurable transparency and always-visible metering is a rational fit for home studios and streaming. The design emphasizes dependable core performance over novel features.

## Advice

If you want transparent main outputs plus clear metering and loopback in a compact 2×2, the M2 remains an excellent choice. If you don’t need the screen/loopback, **Scarlett 2i2 (4th Gen)** is a like-for-like alternative with comparable measured outputs. **SSL 2 MKII** is improved and competitive but measures slightly lower on output DR.
