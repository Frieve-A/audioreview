## Overview

The Zoom AMS-24 is a compact 2-input, 4-output USB audio interface designed specifically for streaming and content creation applications. Launched as part of Zoom's AMS series, it features dual XLR/TRS combo inputs with low-noise preamps, dedicated streaming functionality including loopback capability, and multiple power options including AA battery operation. The unit emphasizes ease of use with hardware switches for common streaming scenarios, positioning itself as a bridge between basic audio interfaces and streaming-specific solutions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The AMS-24 provides basic technical specifications with 24-bit/96kHz resolution and equivalent input noise of -120dBu at +54dB/150ฮฉ, which falls within acceptable ranges for its category. However, critical performance measurements including THD+N, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, intermodulation distortion, and crosstalk specifications are not provided by the manufacturer [1]. Multiple third-party sources consistently report specific noise behavior: "some noise when you crank up the inputs" but "not noticeable when you have a dynamic mic or guitar set to an appropriate gain" [2], while Sound on Sound notes "interfaces can be quite noisy with dynamic mics" [3]. Third-party testing confirms "very flat frequency response that exceeds factory specifications" [2], indicating acceptable frequency linearity. However, the documented noise issues with dynamic microphones at higher gain settings represent a measurable limitation affecting transparency with common microphone types, particularly in professional recording scenarios where optimal signal-to-noise performance is required.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The AMS-24 employs contemporary but not cutting-edge technology without significant proprietary innovations. The design represents standard OEM/ODM audio interface implementation with basic analog-to-digital conversion and USB-C connectivity. While functional features like loopback switching and battery operation provide practical value, these represent straightforward engineering solutions rather than advanced technological developments. The unit lacks sophisticated digital signal processing, proprietary patent technology, or technical implementations that would be considered desirable by competitors. The simple construction offers reliability but demonstrates no particular competitive technological advantage beyond basic functionality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

At 119.99 USD, the AMS-24 competes with streaming-capable audio interfaces offering equivalent functionality. The closest equivalent is the PreSonus AudioBox USB 96 at 99 USD, which provides similar 2-input configuration, phantom power, 24-bit/96kHz capability, and essential streaming functionality including loopback capability [4]. Both interfaces offer equivalent user-facing functions including dual combo inputs, phantom power, direct monitoring, and streaming-oriented features. The AudioBox USB 96 provides documented specifications including 105dB dynamic range and THD+N <0.008%, representing equivalent-or-better measured performance compared to the AMS-24's limited specification disclosure. CP = 99 USD รท 119.99 USD = 0.83, rounded to 0.8.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Zoom provides comprehensive manufacturer support through official documentation, driver downloads, and global support infrastructure [5]. The simple, robust design with few moving parts and USB-C connectivity reduces potential failure points. Bus-powered operation with AA battery backup enhances operational reliability, particularly for portable applications. The company maintains an established track record in professional audio equipment with appropriate warranty coverage and repair support systems. Construction quality appears suitable for intended use cases, though long-term reliability data is limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AMS-24's design philosophy focuses on practical functionality for streaming and content creation applications. Cost allocation directly supports user-facing features including dual preamps, loopback capability, multiple output options, and flexible power systems. The approach emphasizes workflow efficiency over audiophile-oriented specifications, which aligns appropriately with its target market. Integration of recording and streaming functions into a single compact unit provides legitimate justification for dedicated equipment versus general-purpose alternatives. The conservative but practical engineering approach avoids unsubstantiated performance claims while delivering measurable functional benefits for its intended applications.

## Advice

The Zoom AMS-24 serves content creators and streamers who require straightforward audio interface functionality with dedicated streaming features. Its loopback capability, streaming mode switching, and battery operation provide practical advantages over basic audio interfaces for live streaming and content production workflows. However, users requiring documented high-performance specifications or professional recording applications should consider alternatives with comprehensive measured data. The unit represents a reasonable choice for its intended streaming-focused niche, but those prioritizing pure audio performance metrics may find better value in traditional audio interfaces with verified specifications.
