## Overview

The Zoom AMS-22 is an ultra-portable 2-in/2-out USB-C audio interface for entry-level recording and streaming. Released in 2023 as part of Zoom’s AMS series, it offers 24-bit/96 kHz conversion, one XLR/TRS mic/Hi-Z combo input with phantom power, a dedicated stereo 3.5 mm line input, and outputs for headphones and monitors. At 79.99 USD, it targets solo musicians, creators, and streamers who need simple, compact I/O.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate flat frequency response (20 Hz–20 kHz +0/-2 dB at 44.1 kHz; 20–40 kHz +0/-3 dB at 96 kHz), 24-bit operation up to 96 kHz, and an EIN of −120 dBu at +54 dB gain [2]. The gain range is +8 to +54 dB, with max input levels of +0.6 dBu (mic) and +11 dBu (Hi-Z) [1][2]. Third-party testing by a hydrophone manufacturer reports “very flat” response exceeding factory specs and low-noise preamps in practice [3]. Independent published numbers for THD+N, crosstalk, and total dynamic range are still limited; the score reflects this partial evidence.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The AMS-22 uses conventional budget-interface architecture (single mic/Hi-Z preamp, USB-C, 24-bit/96 kHz conversion) without onboard DSP or advanced routing. The extra stereo mini line input is a practical addition for compact rigs, but there is no notable technological novelty beyond standard practice.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market price is 79.99 USD [2][7]. We searched for the **cheapest interface with equal-or-better user-visible functions (mic/Hi-Z combo *plus* dedicated stereo line-in, 24-bit/96 kHz) and equal-or-better measured performance**. Cheaper options such as the Behringer UMC22 are **not equivalent**: it is limited to 16-bit/48 kHz and exhibits significantly lower measured performance in independent tests [4][5]. PreSonus AudioBox GO (~78.99 USD) meets 24-bit/96 kHz on paper but lacks the AMS-22’s dedicated stereo line-in and its ADC dynamic range is specified at 90 dB (48 kHz), which is borderline and not clearly better [0][6]. As of 2025-08-26, no cheaper, truly equivalent-or-better alternative was found. **Therefore, CP = 1.0.**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Official specs and retailer listings confirm Windows/macOS support and class-compliant use with iOS/Android when bus- or externally powered [1][2]. B&H lists a **limited 1-year manufacturer warranty** for the AMS-22 [2]. No systemic reliability issues are established yet (product line is relatively new), and software/firmware feature updates are minimal compared to higher-tier interfaces.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design prioritizes portability and essential I/O. Offering 24-bit/96 kHz conversion and a unique extra stereo line-in at this size/price is sensible for mobile creators. The absence of DSP or software integration keeps costs low but also limits flexibility; the approach is rational for its intended use case.

## Advice

If you need a tiny interface for voice/guitar and occasional stereo line sources (e.g., portable players, small mixers), the AMS-22 is a strong, simple choice at the price. If you require more inputs, consider stepping up within the AMS family. If your budget is extremely tight, cheaper units exist, but be aware many drop to 16-bit/48 kHz or show weaker measured performance; check specs and third-party tests carefully before trading quality for cost [4][5][6].
