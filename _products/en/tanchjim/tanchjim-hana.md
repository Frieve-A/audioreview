## Overview

The Tanchjim Hana 2021 represents the company's refined approach to single dynamic driver in-ear monitor design, featuring their proprietary 3rd Generation DMT (Dynamic Magnetic Technology) with high magnetic flux architecture. Built around a 10mm DMT-3 dynamic driver with HSPLC (High-rigidity Secondary Polymerized Liquid Crystal) diaphragm, the Hana 2021 targets natural and neutral sound reproduction through scientifically-based tuning methodology. The model incorporates optimized tuning with reduced treble peak Q value compared to the original Hana, housed in precision-crafted 316L stainless steel shells with enamel coating. At 179 USD, it positions itself in the competitive mid-tier IEM segment where measurement performance and cost efficiency are critical evaluation factors.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Tanchjim Hana 2021's scientific validity evaluation faces constraints due to limited comprehensive third-party measurement data availability. Manufacturer specifications list THD <0.2% @ 1kHz 94dB SPL, positioning it between the problematic level (0.5% for headphones/earphones) and excellent level (0.05%). As these remain manufacturer specifications without independent verification, conservative evaluation methodology moves the score 0.1 toward 0.5 per policy guidelines. While frequency response measurements exist in Crinacle's B&K 5128 database using standardized measurement protocols, critical audio quality metrics including detailed distortion analysis, S/N ratio, and crosstalk performance lack publicly accessible third-party validation [1]. The claimed frequency response range of 8Hz-50kHz exceeds standard requirements, yet without deviation measurements across the audible spectrum, actual transparency cannot be definitively established.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Hana 2021 demonstrates moderate technological advancement through proprietary DMT-3 technology implementation. Tanchjim's in-house developed 3rd Generation DMT magnetic circuit design achieves higher magnetic flux density compared to standard dynamic drivers, representing genuine patent technology adoption. The HSPLC diaphragm material reflects contemporary engineering approaches for improved transient response and reduced distortion. Company R&D background includes team members with experience at established Japanese acoustic brands, indicating accumulated technical expertise in driver design and acoustic engineering. However, the overall approach remains primarily analog/mechanical without integration of digital signal processing or advanced electronic features that characterize cutting-edge audio products. The technology level reflects competent implementation of proven dynamic driver principles with proprietary enhancements rather than revolutionary innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

This evaluation selects the cheapest comparator that offers equal-or-better user-facing functionality and equal-or-better measured performance. The comparator is the 7Hz Salnotes Zero, which shows low distortion across the band in independent measurements and offers practically equivalent functionality with detachable 0.78mm 2-pin [2]. Using representative prices, Hana 2021 at 179 USD and the comparator at 20 USD [3], CP is calculated as: CP = 20 USD ÷ 179 USD = 0.1. References to Hana 2021’s THD are based on manufacturer specifications.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Tanchjim provides warranty coverage with 1-year protection on earphone body and 6-month coverage on cables, falling below the 2-year industry average (-0.1). The 316L stainless steel shell construction offers robust build quality resistance to wear and environmental factors, though the detachable cable system introduces potential failure points requiring replacement cable availability. Support infrastructure operates primarily through dealer networks with manufacturer contact available but no indication of comprehensive global direct support system (-0.1). User feedback across Tanchjim's product line indicates consistent build quality with positive durability reports, establishing the company as "trustable in terms of built quality and consumer support" according to community assessments [3]. The combination of shorter warranty period and dealer-dependent support structure results in below-average reliability assessment despite solid construction quality.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Tanchjim demonstrates exceptionally rational design approach through measurement-focused engineering methodology and target-based tuning philosophy. The company explicitly develops products using "scientifically-based measurements" and designs to "specific frequency response targets rather than arbitrary tuning preferences," indicating objective-first development process [4]. Investigation reveals their "science-backed approach," "measurement-focused" methodology, and commitment to "target-based design" represents the highest level of rationality in audio engineering. The Hana 2021 represents iterative improvement over the original model with "optimized tuning with reduced treble peak Q value for more neutral and smooth treble orientation," demonstrating measurable performance advancement through engineering refinement. Proprietary DMT-3 technology and HSPLC diaphragm selection reflect rational approaches to improving measured performance parameters rather than marketing-driven material choices. Third-party validation confirms their engineering approach achieves "solid technical performance" with THD <0.056% on Origin model, demonstrating consistent commitment to measurable excellence across their product line [4]. The design philosophy completely eliminates occult approaches and emphasizes scientific verification, representing optimal rationality in contemporary audio engineering.

## Advice

For potential purchasers seeking single dynamic driver IEMs with low measured distortion, the Tanchjim Hana 2021 demonstrates rational engineering and solid specifications. However, low-cost alternatives with independently verified low distortion also exist [2], so it is not necessarily the strongest value when price is the priority. Consider Hana 2021 if you value measured performance together with build quality, materials, and accessories. References to Hana’s distortion figures are based on manufacturer specifications.
