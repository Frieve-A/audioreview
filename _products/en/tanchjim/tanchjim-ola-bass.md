## Overview

The Tanchjim Ola Bass is a bass-enhanced version of the company's popular Ola model released in 2022. It has been redesigned from the original DMT4 architecture driver to feature a 10mm PEEK composite diaphragm and titanium dome structure, aiming for richer bass expression. Tanchjim is a Chinese manufacturer established in 2015, particularly known for single dynamic driver technology. The market price is 42.99 USD (approximately 6,500 JPY), positioning it as standard within its price range for IEMs.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The claimed THD+N of less than 0.3% represents a passing grade level for IEMs, but shows no notable advantages compared to competing products in the same price range. While the frequency response claims a wide bandwidth of 7Hz-45kHz, the lack of actual measurement data makes objective evaluation difficult. The sensitivity of 126dB/Vrms is within the range that can be sufficiently driven by typical smartphones. Although the adoption of the PEEK composite diaphragm is said to improve distortion characteristics compared to the previous model, actual measurement data showing significant improvements within audible thresholds could not be confirmed. Despite claiming bass enhancement, many reviews state that it is "insufficient for bassheads who prefer the Harman curve," making the scientific basis of the tuning unclear.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The combination of a 10mm PEEK composite diaphragm and titanium dome structure represents appropriate material selection commonly used in high-end units. The redesigned architecture from the original Ola's DMT4 demonstrates technical progress. However, the basic configuration does not exceed the scope of single dynamic driver designs that exist abundantly in the market, with no breakthrough proprietary technologies observed. The cable uses 4N OFC silver-plated wire in a litz coaxial structure, showing material selection appropriate for the price range. The adoption of Italian SATTI filters contributes to quality improvement, but this is also an application of existing technology, placing the technical level within industry average standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Against the price of 42.99 USD (approximately 6,500 JPY), alternatives with equivalent or superior performance exist. The most affordable equivalent product is the Moondrop Chu II (approximately 22 USD, about 3,300 JPY), resulting in a CP value of 3,300 JPY รท 6,500 JPY = 0.51, which rounds to 0.5. The 7Hz Salnotes Zero 2 (25 USD, approximately 3,800 JPY) also offers equivalent performance at a lower price. These competing products all feature single dynamic driver configurations with similar output characteristics and connectivity while showing comparable performance in measurement data. The technical advantages of the Tanchjim Ola Bass are not clear enough to justify the price difference.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Tanchjim is a manufacturer established in 2015 with approximately 10 years of track record. Products come with a standard 1-year warranty, and purchases through major distributors also provide a 10-day initial defect exchange guarantee. Regarding build quality, the configuration of acrylic shell with aluminum faceplate maintains quality appropriate for the price range. Nano coating for dust and water resistance is also applied, ensuring durability for daily use. However, as an emerging Chinese manufacturer, long-term reliability track record is limited compared to established manufacturers from Europe, America, and Japan. The support system largely depends on distributors, with limited direct manufacturer support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Despite bearing the name "Bass," the actual tuning leans toward "Bright Neutral," showing contradictory design philosophy. The evaluation that it is "insufficient for bassheads" while claiming bass enhancement raises questions about product concept consistency. The adoption of PEEK diaphragm is rational from a materials engineering perspective, but its contribution to final acoustic characteristics has not been clearly demonstrated. While the single dynamic driver configuration is valid as a design, the differentiation factors are unclear among numerous competing products taking similar approaches in the same price range. The existence value as dedicated equipment also lacks persuasiveness when equivalent function and performance can be achieved with cheaper alternatives. The disclosure of measurement data is also limited, showing a half-hearted attitude toward scientific approaches.

## Advice

While the Tanchjim Ola Bass is technically a valid product, it cannot be recommended from a cost-performance perspective. Cheaper alternatives such as the Moondrop Chu II (approximately 3,300 JPY) and 7Hz Salnotes Zero 2 (approximately 3,800 JPY) exist. These competing products feature the same single dynamic driver configuration and show comparable performance in measurement data. Particularly, the Moondrop Chu II achieves equivalent sound quality at approximately half the price, offering superior cost-performance. Unless there is special attachment to the Tanchjim brand, we strongly recommend choosing these lower-priced alternatives. With a budget of 6,500 JPY, there is more investment value in higher-grade products or combinations with DAC-integrated amplifiers for overall system sound quality improvement.
