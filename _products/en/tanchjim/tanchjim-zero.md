## Overview

The Tanchjim Zero is an in-ear monitor (IEM) developed by Chinese audio manufacturer Tanchjim. It features a single dynamic driver configuration with a 10mm composite diaphragm, and an acoustic design optimized by DMT 4 technology. Despite its market price of 15 USD (as of July 2025), it achieves neutral sound characteristics and an analytical sound presentation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

According to measured data, THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) is reported to be less than 0.5% at 1kHz 94dB SPL, avoiding the problematic level (0.5% or higher) for the IEM product category, though it does not reach the excellent level (0.05% or lower). Basic specifications of 118dB/Vrms sensitivity, 32Ω±10% impedance, and a frequency response range of 7-50kHz are at a practical level. However, a lack of texture in the low-frequency range and limitations in resolution have been pointed out, leading to the judgment that it does not reach a transparent level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The DMT 4 dynamic driver technology realizes a composite design employing an ultra-fine fiber suspension and a beryllium-coated diaphragm. A commensurate level of technological investment is recognized, including optimization of the waveguide structure using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, enhancement of the magnetic circuit, and adjustment of suspension quality. The adoption of Italian-made SATTI filters and dust/water resistance via nanomaterial coating are commendable technical ingenuities but are limited when compared to the highest industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The market price of 15 USD (as of July 2025) is at the lowest level among neutral-oriented IEMs with comparable functions and performance. Its price advantage is clear when compared to major competitors such as the Moondrop Chu II (19 USD) and the 7Hz Salnotes Zero (23 USD). Providing a certain standard of neutral sound at this price maximizes its cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The housing is constructed from ABS resin and an aluminum alloy faceplate, providing basic durability. However, the non-detachable cable makes repair difficult in case of failure. As an emerging manufacturer, the track record for long-term product support and warranty handling is limited, leaving uncertain factors regarding reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The pursuit of neutral tuning based on scientific measurements represents a rational approach. The design philosophy emphasizing objective sound reproduction over subjective musicality demonstrates a correct direction toward achieving transparent-level sound quality. The adoption of composite diaphragms and optimization through FEA are also rational technical choices that contribute to improved measured performance. However, while no unscientific claims are observed, the utilization of more advanced digital signal processing technologies and initiatives for innovative price disruption remain limited.

## Advice

The Tanchjim Zero is the optimal choice for users seeking "a neutral IEM on a minimal budget." No other product exists that provides an analytical sound and appropriate technical standards at the 15 USD price point. However, the lack of bass presence and resolution limitations are commensurate with the price; a higher budget is required for higher sound quality. It is recommended to consider pairing with warm-leaning source equipment and to prepare an environment capable of supplying appropriate power (1-2 Vrms). Attention should also be paid to its insufficient isolation.
