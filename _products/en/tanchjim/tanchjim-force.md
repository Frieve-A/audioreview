## Overview

The Tanchjim Force is a 279.99 USD dual dynamic IEM co-developed by Tanchjim and Effect Audio. It features 8.2mm and 10mm dynamic drivers of different sizes and adopts an unusual open-back design structure. Founded in 2015, Tanchjim has established a solid position as a high-quality Chinese IEM brand, known for popular models like Oxygen and Origin. The Force is based on the company's DMT4 Ultra technology and aims for high-precision acoustic control through drivers with beryllium and titanium coatings.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The THD performance of 0.036% @1kHz 94dB is good but does not reach industry-leading standards. The 17Ω±10% impedance and 120dB/Vrms sensitivity fall within standard ranges. The 8Hz-48kHz frequency response covers a wide range, but detailed flatness data could not be confirmed. The open-back design may contribute to soundstage expansion and reduction of internal reflections, but at the cost of sound isolation. While HPFD-Seg frequency division technology claims to achieve a low distortion rate of 0.036%, these measurements meet industry transparency-level standards but cannot be considered world-class.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The 8.2mm and 10mm dual dynamic configuration is a rational approach for optimal frequency band allocation. The proprietary driver development based on DMT4 Ultra technology, combined with a beryllium-coated mid-high frequency driver and a titanium-coated low-frequency driver, is technically advanced. Unique engineering approaches are evident, such as acoustic control through a fine steel mesh in the open-back design and HPFD-Seg frequency domain crossover technology. The collaboration with Effect Audio has resulted in a high-purity silver-plated monocrystalline copper cable and a modular connection system, placing the overall technology level in the upper tier of the industry.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against its 279.99 USD price, the Truthear Hexa, which offers equivalent or superior acoustic performance (especially excellent frequency response and low distortion), is available for just 79.99 USD. The cost-performance is calculated as `79.99 USD ÷ 279.99 USD = 0.286`, resulting in an extremely low rating. Although the Hexa is a 1DD+2BA hybrid, there is no discernible difference in the final acoustic performance for the user; in fact, it achieves equivalent or higher fidelity for less than a third of the Force's price. Even considering the Force's unique technology and its collaboration with Effect Audio, it is not competitive in terms of pure performance-to-price ratio, making its cost-performance remarkably poor.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Since its establishment in 2015, Tanchjim has released highly-rated products like Oxygen and has gained a stable reputation in the audiophile community. With a development team of over 40 members, including engineers with experience at Japanese acoustic companies, its technical foundation is solid. However, as an emerging Chinese brand, its long-term reliability track record is limited, and there are uncertainties regarding its long-term repair support system and parts supply. Details of its international support structure are also difficult to assess from publicly available information, leading to a rating of average industry-standard reliability and support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The open-back design is an unusual approach for an IEM but is based on a clear acoustic rationale for expanding the soundstage and reducing internal reflections. Rational design decisions that directly contribute to improved measurement performance are evident, such as the dedicated frequency band allocation by the dual dynamic configuration and the use of different coating materials. The continuous development of DMT4 Ultra technology and the specialized collaboration with Effect Audio represent an efficient approach that leverages their respective strengths. The HPFD-Seg technology for precise frequency division control is also based on scientific principles. The commitment to eliminating occult elements and pursuing measurable performance improvements is highly commendable.

## Advice

The Tanchjim Force is a technically interesting product, but its purchase cannot be recommended at all. The reason is that the Truthear Hexa, which offers equivalent or superior acoustic performance, is available for just 79.99 USD. Unless you find special value in the Force's open-back design or its collaboration with Effect Audio, it is difficult to justify the price difference of approximately 200 USD. If you are seeking pure acoustic performance, the Truthear Hexa is the overwhelmingly more rational choice. Many other inexpensive and high-performance alternatives also exist, such as the Kiwi Ears KE4 (109 USD). Choosing the Force should be limited to cases where you feel a strong attraction to its unique technical approach or design, disregarding the performance difference.
