## Overview

The Tanchjim Bunny is a ~20 USD single dynamic IEM positioned in the ultra-budget segment. It uses a dual-chamber acoustic design with a titanium-plated PET diaphragm and ships in either a 3.5 mm analog version or a USB-C DSP bundle; both use a detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin interface [2][3]. Tanchjim’s companion software provides firmware and DSP support for applicable products [5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications list THD at **0.05% @ 1 kHz, 94 dB**, frequency response **8 Hz–48 kHz**, nominal **impedance 30 Ω (±10%)**, and **sensitivity 123 dB/Vrms** [2][3][9]. If verified, the THD figure meets the “excellent” threshold for earphones in our criteria. However, as of the review date we have not found credible third-party measurements for Bunny’s full response and distortion; therefore the score remains baseline (0.5) pending independent confirmation. The 2-pin architecture and conventional single-DD topology are standard and do not, by themselves, guarantee transparent frequency response [8].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Bunny implements mature, widely-adopted approaches: single DD with dual-chamber loading, titanium-plated PET diaphragm, and (for the DSP bundle) dual 24-bit DACs with up to **96 kHz** support via USB-C cable [2][4]. Nothing here represents a step-change other manufacturers would need to adopt; execution appears competent rather than novel.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Using the defined formula, we select the **cheapest equivalent-or-better** product by functions and measured performance proxies:

- **Comparator:** **TANGZU Wan’er S.G**, **18.90 USD** (detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin; community FR measurements show neutral-leaning tuning comparable to established baselines) [6][7].  
- **Equivalence note:** Same user-visible functions (wired IEM, detachable 2-pin) and community FR behavior aligned to neutral targets, so user-facing performance is **equivalent-or-better** on FR; no known deficits in basic specs.

**CP = 18.90 USD ÷ 20 USD = 0.945 → 0.9** (rounded to one decimal).  
For context, **MOONDROP CHU II** commonly lists at **22.99 USD** [10], which would yield a higher CP (clamped to 1.0), but Wan’er S.G is cheaper while meeting equivalence.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Budget construction with a detachable 2-pin cable aids field serviceability for common failures [2][8][9]. Warranty norms seen at retailers show **about 1 year** on the earpieces (shorter on cables) depending on region/retailer; manufacturer app/firmware support is relevant only to DSP-cable use [4][5].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design prioritizes conventional, cost-effective engineering (single DD, dual-chamber, detachable 2-pin) and optional DSP/EQ via cable/app to meet user preferences [2][4][5]. The approach is practical and avoids unsupported claims; it neither advances the state of the art nor exhibits pseudoscientific elements.

## Advice

If you want a detachable-cable IEM around **20 USD** and can accept “competent but unverified” third-party measurements for this exact model, Bunny is reasonable. If you want the **maximum verified performance per dollar** and can deviate from Tanchjim, consider **TANGZU Wan’er S.G** (cheaper, neutral-leaning FR per community databases) or **MOONDROP CHU II** (widely measured, slightly higher street price) [6][7][10]. Choose the **DSP bundle** only if you specifically need app-tunable EQ via USB-C [4][5].
