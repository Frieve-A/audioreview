## Overview

The OneOdio Pro-C is a wired/wireless dual-compatible headphone developed by Chinese audio brand OneOdio. It features 50mm neodymium drivers and achieves wireless connectivity through Bluetooth 5.2 and AAC support. The headphone incorporates a 1000mAh battery claiming up to 110 hours of ultra-long playback and is positioned in the budget segment at approximately 47 USD market price. Like other OneOdio products, it adopts V-shaped acoustic tuning that emphasizes bass and treble frequencies for "fun sound" reproduction. The foldable structure and 90-degree rotation mechanism enhance portability and practicality, targeting consumers with budget constraints.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The OneOdio Pro-C's measured performance presents fundamental issues from a scientific audio reproduction perspective. Despite adopting 50mm drivers, the typical V-shaped characteristics cause frequency response to significantly deviate from the transparent level (±0.5dB) and vastly exceed even the problematic level (±3.0dB). Excessive bass emphasis shows +6dB or more boost around 20Hz, midrange frequencies are severely recessed, and treble exhibits unnatural emphasis. While AAC support during wireless connection is commendable, transparent audio reproduction remains difficult due to fundamental acoustic design problems. Regarding THD+N, distortion notably increases in bass frequencies during high-volume playback, creating conditions far from faithful master source reproduction. The 110-hour playback represents a technical achievement but contributes nothing to audio quality improvement, resulting in extremely limited scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The OneOdio Pro-C adopts 50mm neodymium drivers and Bluetooth 5.2, but technological innovation remains limited. The 110-hour playback via 1000mAh battery shows certain technical intent, but this results from simple battery capacity increase without recognizable technical contribution to power efficiency or audio quality improvement. Bluetooth 5.2 and AAC support represent modern specifications but constitute standard implementation of existing technology. The 90-degree rotation mechanism and foldable structure are practical but do not directly contribute to audio quality. The wired/wireless dual design provides convenience but shows no confirmable acoustic engineering technical superiority. Overall, this represents standard design through existing technology combinations, with no recognizable proprietary technology development or patent technology implementation. The technology level is judged below industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The OneOdio Pro-C is priced at approximately 47 USD. Focusing on its most prominent feature—110 hours of continuous playback—there are no competing products on the market that offer equivalent or longer playback time at a lower price, making it effectively the world's most affordable option for this specific capability. Therefore, for users who prioritize battery life above all else, it delivers unparalleled cost-performance (1.0). On the other hand, when considering overall performance including sound quality and additional features like noise cancellation, many other competitors exist in the same price range. However, as this evaluation is based on the "most affordable alternative with equivalent or superior performance," the score is 1.0 due to its outstanding 110-hour playback.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

OneOdio is a relatively emerging brand with limited long-term reliability data. Product warranty provides standard 1-year coverage, but compared to products with long-term market track records like Sony's WH-1000XM series, reliability accumulation is insufficient. The long-term durability of the large 1000mAh battery capacity remains unknown, and considering general lithium-ion battery degradation characteristics, concerns exist about performance maintenance after 2-3 years. Regarding build quality, the durability of folding mechanisms and moving parts is reasonable considering the price range, but unsuitable for long-term professional use. Customer support primarily operates in English and Chinese, with limited expectation for detailed Japanese technical support. Firmware update support status remains unclear.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The OneOdio Pro-C's design philosophy presents fundamental problems from a scientific audio reproduction perspective. The pursuit of "fun sound" through V-shaped tuning contradicts the essential purpose of acoustic equipment: faithful reproduction of master sources. The focus on extreme 110-hour playback also indicates design priorities emphasizing marketing appeal points over audio quality improvement, lacking scientific rationality. The adoption of large 50mm drivers also fails to contribute to audio quality improvement despite physical enlargement, as the resulting acoustic characteristics significantly deviate from transparent levels. While wired/wireless dual functionality provides convenience, fundamental frequency response problems remain unresolved even during wired connection from an audio quality perspective. While entertainment-focused design philosophy is understandable, efforts toward scientifically-based audio quality improvement remain insufficient, resulting in low design philosophy rationality evaluation.

## Advice

The OneOdio Pro-C is an excellent choice for users who prioritize battery life above all else, thanks to its phenomenal playback time. However, its 1.0 cost-performance score is based solely on this specific feature, and it cannot be recommended for users who value scientifically accurate audio reproduction. For critical applications like music production or mixing, the skewed frequency response will impede accurate judgment. For a more balanced option, the OneOdio A70 (approx. 30 USD) offers a substantial 72 hours of playback at a lower price. If your budget allows, investing in products with superior measured performance, such as the JBL Tune 720BT (approx. 59 USD) or the Sony WH-CH720N (approx. 113 USD) which also includes noise cancellation, is strongly recommended. For purely entertainment purposes where powerful bass, extreme battery life, and a low price are the top priorities, the Pro-C can be a strong contender. It is essential to audition them before buying to ensure the V-shaped sound signature suits your personal preference.
