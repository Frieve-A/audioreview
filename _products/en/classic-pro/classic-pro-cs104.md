summary: "A compact 2-way passive PA speaker (4\" + 1\") with 100Hz–20kHz spec, 109dB max SPL, 90°×90° coverage, and THD<3%. It’s practical for speech/BGM installations. At 61 USD street (JP market ≈8,980円), a cheaper equivalent exists (Behringer SAT1004 at 59 USD), yielding CP 0.967 → rounded to 1.0."

## Overview

The Classic Pro CS104 is a small passive PA box with a 4" woofer and 1" HF driver. Manufacturer specs list 100Hz–20kHz bandwidth, 109dB max SPL, 90°×90° coverage, 80W program power handling, and Speakon plus barrier strip terminals. An L-bracket is included for wall mounting. The enclosure measures 14.4×21.4×14.6 cm and weighs 2.5 kg [1]. Typical street price is about 61 USD equivalent (JP market ~8,980円) [1][5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Manufacturer numbers indicate 100Hz–20kHz, THD<3%, and 109dB max SPL [1]. Below 100Hz output is limited, and the quoted THD figure is relatively high for high-fidelity listening. For speech/BGM in small venues, the on-axis coverage and output are adequate. Due to the lack of comprehensive third-party measurements, we keep the score conservative at 0.3.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

This is a conventional 2-way passive design with standard connectivity and no publicly disclosed unique waveguides, materials, or patents beyond typical installation hardware [1]. Practical, but not technically novel.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market price used: **61 USD** (JP street ≈8,980円) [1][5]. The cheapest **equivalent-or-better** option we could confirm is **Behringer SAT1004** at **59 USD** in the US market, a passive wall-mount 2-way with comparable installation use, 110Hz–20kHz, and included mounting bracket [2][4].  
**Computation**: 59 USD ÷ 61 USD = **0.967** → rounded to one decimal = **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No public MTBF/RMA data, but the retailer advertises a 3-year warranty program on the site, which is above the minimum norm for this class in JP retail [1]. Firmware is not applicable to passive speakers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The product prioritizes compact footprint, wide coverage, and simple installation—rational for paging/BGM. However, the design does not aim for low distortion/high extension required for high-end critical listening, so the philosophy is utilitarian rather than fidelity-maximizing [1].

## Advice

Choose CS104 when you need discreet wall-mount speakers for speech/BGM with simple passive wiring and broad coverage. For fuller low end, add a subwoofer. If minimizing cost with equivalent installation-grade functionality is your priority, consider **Behringer SAT1004 (59 USD)** [2][4]. For near-field production tasks, an active monitor like **Edifier MR4** offers flatter response (60Hz–20kHz) and very low distortion (≤0.2%) at **169.99 USD/pair** [3].
