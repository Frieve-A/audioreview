## Overview

Classic Pro CSP10 is a 10-inch, 2-way passive PA loudspeaker in a lightweight polypropylene enclosure sold individually (not as a pair). It targets small venues, events, and speech reinforcement where portability and low cost matter more than extended low-frequency output. Key catalog specifications include frequency response 55Hz–18kHz (−3dB), 50Hz–20kHz (−10dB), sensitivity 94dB (1W/1m), maximum SPL 117dB (+3dB), nominal impedance 8Ω, and allowable input 500W (manufacturer specs) [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

From a fidelity standpoint, the CSP10’s specified 55Hz–18kHz (−3dB) and 117dB max SPL are adequate for small PA use but fall short of transparent reproduction targets. There are no credible independent measurement sets (polar data, on-axis ±dB windows, distortion vs. SPL) publicly available at this time; therefore we base this section on manufacturer specifications and clearly mark them as such [1]. Until third-party data appears, we treat performance as modest: useful vocal clarity, limited LF extension typical of compact 10-inch cabinets.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Conventional 2-way design (10-inch woofer + 1-inch HF driver) with a polypropylene cabinet and standard Speakon connectivity. No novel acoustic engineering or advanced materials are claimed beyond routine network optimization; this is a cost-oriented build consistent with commodity PA designs [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price used for evaluation: **145 USD** (Japan domestic price is **21,800円**; CP in this article is computed in USD) [1].  
The cheapest **equal-or-better** passive 10-inch comparator we identified is **Yamaha CBR10** at **295.99 USD** with wider rated bandwidth (50–20,000Hz), identical sensitivity (94dB), and **higher** maximum SPL (123dB) [2]. Cheaper options like Behringer **PK110** exist in the market, but their published data indicate clearly **inferior** performance (e.g., higher usable LF cutoff and much lower SPL capability), so they cannot serve as equal-or-better comparators [3].  
**Conclusion:** within surveyed current products, CSP10 is presently the **cheapest option meeting the required functions and performance**, so CP = **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Passive architecture (few electronic failure points) and broad retail support via the manufacturer-retailer offer a baseline reliability profile. Specific long-term RMA/MTBF data are not disclosed. Warranty details for this model are not explicitly documented on the product page; with simple construction we assign a base 0.5 and add +0.1 for the inherently robust passive design.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Design choices prioritize portability and price over absolute fidelity—reasonable for PA utility. Marketing claims are restrained and measurable (basic SPL/bandwidth), with no pseudoscientific assertions. However, the approach does not push toward state-of-the-art transparency.

## Advice

Choose CSP10 when you need inexpensive, portable reinforcement for speech, acoustic sets, classrooms, festivals, or gymnasiums. Pair with a competent power amplifier and consider a subwoofer if music program requires stronger bass below ~60Hz. If you need higher output or wider bandwidth from a single box, step up to models like Yamaha CBR10 (but expect substantially higher price) [2].
