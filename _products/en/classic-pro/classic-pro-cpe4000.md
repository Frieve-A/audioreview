## Overview

The Classic Pro CPE4000 is a wired in-ear monitor from Sound House’s house brand using a 10 mm dynamic driver. Current market price is **33 USD** (Japan domestic price **4,980円**) with key catalog specs of 22 Ω impedance, 113 dB±3 dB sensitivity, and 20 Hz–20 kHz frequency response, per the official product page [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As of the review date, no credible third-party acoustic measurements (FR, THD, isolation) for CPE4000 were found. Accordingly, evaluation relies on manufacturer specifications explicitly labeled as such—22 Ω, 113 dB±3 dB, 20 Hz–20 kHz—taken from the official page [1]. In the absence of independent data confirming frequency-response deviation or distortion within transparent thresholds, the score is held at the neutral baseline per policy until measurements emerge.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

CPE4000 uses a conventional single dynamic-driver topology with a fixed 3.5 mm cable and standard silicone tips; no proprietary acoustic structures, digital processing, or novel materials are documented on the official page [1]. With no public patents or white papers and no multi-driver or advanced integration, its technical ambition is below contemporary peers that publish measurement-driven designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Cheapest equal-or-better comparator: **QKZ x HBB** at **19.00 USD**, equipped with a 10 mm titanium-coated dynamic driver and **detachable 2-pin cable** [2]. Third-party FR databases include QKZ x HBB with controlled midband and widely accepted tuning references [3]. Given CPE4000’s lack of independent measurements and equivalent user-facing function (wired IEM for monitoring/listening) per [1], QKZ x HBB qualifies as **equal-or-better** from a user perspective.  
**Calculation (USD basis):** 19.00 USD ÷ 33 USD = **0.58** → rounded to **0.6**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a Sound House house-brand product sold domestically in Japan, support is available through the retailer’s established channel. Simple single-driver construction and fixed cable imply average field reliability; no extended warranty, failure-rate data, or firmware factors are disclosed beyond typical catalog info [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design targets affordable, basic stage monitoring without unnecessary features. This conservative approach avoids occult claims and focuses on practical fundamentals, but it also forgoes modern measurement-driven refinements or technical innovation that could improve verified transparency [1].

## Advice

If you need a low-cost wired monitor and local support in Japan, CPE4000 is serviceable. However, for pure price-to-performance value, **QKZ x HBB (19 USD)** delivers equal-or-better functionality, detachable cables, and documented FR data availability at a substantially lower price [2][3].
