## Overview

The Classic Pro CP4HM II is a compact 4-channel stereo headphone amplifier manufactured by Sound House under their Classic Pro brand. Measuring 10.4 cm × 5.9 cm × 4.6 cm and weighing approximately 197g, this unit provides individual volume control for four headphone outputs from a single stereo input. The amplifier delivers 50mW output power at 32Ω impedance and accepts inputs up to +15 dBu through standard 6.3mm connections. Classic Pro positions this product as a budget-oriented solution for basic headphone distribution needs in professional and semi-professional audio applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be comprehensively evaluated due to insufficient measurement data for the CP4HM II specifically. The manufacturer provides only basic specifications including maximum output level (50mW @ 32Ω), maximum input level (+15 dBu), and input impedance (40 kΩ), but lacks critical audio quality measurements such as S/N ratio, THD/THD+N, crosstalk, and damping factor. While comparable products in this category show measurement data availability (such as competing models specifying S/N ratios >98dB and THD <0.01%), the CP4HM II lacks such published measurements from either manufacturer or third-party sources. According to evaluation policy guidelines, when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 as "unable to evaluate" status. Independent measurement data will be incorporated to refine this assessment when available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The CP4HM II represents mature, well-established headphone amplifier technology without particular innovation or technical advancement. The product employs conventional analog amplification circuits with no evidence of proprietary patents, technical papers, or sophisticated implementation. The technology is easily replicable with no competitive differentiation or significant technical expertise accumulation. As an analog-only solution without advanced integration of digital processing, software, or cutting-edge technologies, it scores below average in technical sophistication. The design reflects basic functionality rather than technological innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The CP4HM II provides 4-channel headphone distribution with individual volume controls, 50mW output power capability, +15 dBu input handling capacity, and 40 kΩ input impedance for 21 USD (converted from official Sound House retail price of ¥3,280) [1]. The Behringer HA400 MicroAmp offers equivalent-or-better functions, equipped with 4-channel distribution with individual volume controls, superior input impedance (100 kΩ), equivalent maximum input level (+15 dBu), and ultra low-noise 4580 operational amplifiers [4]. The HA400 is available at 17.07 USD [9], making it the cheapest equivalent option. CP = 17.07 USD ÷ 21 USD = 0.8. Both products offer basic 4-channel headphone distribution, with the HA400 providing superior technical specifications and lower pricing than the CP4HM II.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Classic Pro offers above-average 3-year warranty coverage through Sound House's comprehensive support infrastructure, exceeding typical 2-year industry standards [6]. The simple analog amplifier design provides inherent reliability benefits with fewer failure-prone components. However, quality control issues have been reported across other Classic Pro products, including premature hardware failures in the CPH7000BT headphones where users experienced structural failures after minimal use [7], and connectivity issues in the CPE100 wireless earbuds with audio skipping and disconnection problems [8]. User reports indicate variable build quality characteristic of budget-oriented brands [8]. The extended warranty coverage and Sound House's established support network partially offset concerns about initial product quality, resulting in average reliability expectations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Classic Pro's design philosophy emphasizes cost-effectiveness and functional delivery while maintaining low production costs, aligning with rational design principles for budget-conscious users. Costs directly contribute to core amplification functions rather than premium materials or aesthetic elements. The company actively pursues cost optimization through simplified designs and efficient manufacturing processes. However, the conservative approach with limited technical advancement and lack of innovation prevents higher evaluation. The focus on "functionality, operability, and sound quality" represents practical priorities, though execution remains constrained by budget positioning rather than performance optimization.

## Advice

The Classic Pro CP4HM II suits users requiring basic 4-channel headphone distribution functionality at budget-friendly pricing, particularly in educational, practice, or casual monitoring applications where individual volume control is essential. The compact size and lightweight design benefit portable setups and space-constrained installations. However, at 21 USD, the CP4HM II offers limited cost-performance due to the availability of the superior Behringer HA400 at 17.07 USD. Users seeking better value should consider the Behringer HA400, which offers superior technical performance including higher input impedance and superior operational amplifiers at a lower price point. The CP4HM II may still suit users specifically requiring Sound House's direct support or preferring local warranty service through Japanese distribution channels. The 3-year warranty coverage provides reasonable protection for the price point.
