## Overview

The Classic Pro CM21 is a supercardioid dynamic vocal microphone designed for stage and live performance applications. Manufactured by Classic Pro, Sound House's in-house brand, the CM21 represents an entry-level solution for performers requiring directional pickup patterns at budget pricing. The microphone features conventional dynamic transducer technology with a straight-type grille head optimized for close vocal work, targeting amateur and semi-professional users seeking basic functionality without premium features.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Evaluation based on available manufacturer specifications reveals mixed performance against established measurement criteria. The frequency response of 50Hz-16kHz falls significantly short of the ideal 20Hz-20kHz range, missing substantial low-end (20-50Hz) and high-end (16-20kHz) content that affects overall fidelity. Maximum SPL capability of 140dB meets excellent-level thresholds for professional applications. However, critical performance indicators including S/N ratio and equivalent noise level remain undisclosed, preventing comprehensive assessment of noise floor characteristics. Conservative scoring reflects the limited frequency bandwidth and absence of third-party measurement verification [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The CM21 employs conventional dynamic microphone technology without notable technical innovations or proprietary developments. As a typical OEM/ODM product within Classic Pro's portfolio, the design relies on mature dynamic transducer principles and standard 200Ω impedance matching. No evidence exists of patent technology adoption, advanced materials implementation, or cutting-edge manufacturing processes. The analog-only design approach excludes modern digital signal processing integration or sophisticated acoustic engineering advancements. Technology level reflects industry-standard implementation suitable for basic applications but lacking competitive differentiation or forward-looking technical approaches.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 25 USD, no cheaper alternative was identified that provides equivalent-or-better user-facing functionality (wired XLR connectivity, stage-appropriate directional isolation) and numeric performance (50Hz–16kHz frequency range, 140dB max SPL). Therefore, within equivalent-or-better options, the CM21 is the cheapest, and CP is 1.0 [1].

Note (for readers): Behringer XM1800S shows 80Hz–15kHz frequency response and 600Ω impedance. Compared with CM21’s specs (50Hz–16kHz, 200Ω, 140dB max SPL), the bandwidth is narrower; thus it cannot be judged equivalent-or-better based on numeric performance and is excluded from CP comparison. Example JP market price: 45 USD (tax-in, 3-pack) [2].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Dynamic microphone construction inherently provides robust operational characteristics with minimal failure-prone components, contributing to long-term reliability expectations. The simple mechanical design utilizing conventional diaphragm and coil assembly reduces potential maintenance requirements compared to condenser alternatives. Sound House offers dealer-based support infrastructure through its established retail network, providing standard warranty coverage and basic service coordination. However, the product lacks extended warranty options or specialized professional support systems. As a new release from Classic Pro, limited long-term reliability data exists for failure rate assessment, though the underlying technology demonstrates proven durability across industry applications.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Classic Pro demonstrates rational design philosophy by prioritizing essential functionality over marketing-driven features, aligning development costs directly with performance requirements. The approach emphasizes practical value delivery through conventional supercardioid implementation without unsubstantiated audio quality claims or pseudo-scientific marketing terminology. Design decisions focus on cost-effective manufacturing using established dynamic principles rather than pursuing unnecessary complexity or premium materials without measurable benefits. The product strategy appropriately targets budget market segments where basic supercardioid functionality provides genuine user value, avoiding the audio industry's common tendency toward overpriced "audiophile" positioning without objective performance advantages.

## Advice

For users requiring supercardioid pickup patterns at minimal investment, the CM21 offers practical value despite technical limitations. The microphone suits amateur performers, small venue applications, and situations where basic directional isolation suffices over premium fidelity. However, professional applications demanding full-bandwidth response or critical recording environments would benefit from higher-specification alternatives. The limited frequency range may affect vocal clarity and presence, particularly for critical listening applications. Budget-conscious purchasers should consider the CM21 when supercardioid directionality provides specific advantage over cardioid alternatives, while users prioritizing maximum fidelity should investigate measurement-verified options with extended frequency response and documented noise performance specifications.
