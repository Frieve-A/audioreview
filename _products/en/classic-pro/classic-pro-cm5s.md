## Overview

The Classic Pro CM5S is a dynamic vocal microphone manufactured under Sound House's private label brand. Positioned as an entry-level professional microphone, it features basic dynamic microphone technology with an ON/OFF switch and standard XLR connectivity. The product includes microphone holder and hard case accessories, targeting vocal applications including speeches, karaoke, and presentations. Classic Pro operates as Sound House's house brand using OEM arrangements rather than in-house development.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The CM5S lacks comprehensive measurement data necessary for scientific evaluation. Available specifications include frequency response of 80Hz-15kHz, sensitivity of -73dB ± 3dB, and output impedance of 600Ω ± 30%. The limited frequency response range (80Hz-15kHz) falls significantly short of the full audio spectrum (20Hz-20kHz), with particularly concerning high-frequency rolloff at 15kHz. Critical performance metrics including THD, SNR, and detailed frequency response measurements are unavailable from both manufacturer and independent sources. The restricted frequency range and absence of third-party verification data indicate performance below acceptable standards for modern microphone applications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The CM5S employs standard mature dynamic microphone technology without proprietary innovations. The product utilizes conventional dynamic capsule design with no technical differentiation or competitive advantages. As an OEM product under Sound House's private label, it represents established technology without advancement. The included ON/OFF switch provides practical utility but represents basic functionality rather than innovation. The purely analog/mechanical design lacks integration with modern digital signal processing or advanced features commonly found in contemporary microphone designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The CM5S is priced at approximately 13 USD in current markets [1]. As the world's cheapest dynamic microphone with equivalent or better functionality and measured performance, no cheaper alternatives exist. Equipped with cardioid pattern and XLR connectivity, the CM5S represents the most cost-effective entry point for professional audio applications. CP = 1.0

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sound House provides 3-year warranty coverage for products purchased through their channel, extending beyond typical 1-year manufacturer warranties. The dynamic microphone construction features simple design with few moving parts, inherently resistant to degradation and failure. Support infrastructure includes specialized staff expertise and multiple contact methods through Sound House. However, global support remains limited to Sound House Japan operations, restricting international service availability. The lack of firmware requirements eliminates software-related reliability concerns typical of digital audio equipment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Classic Pro's design philosophy emphasizes cost-effectiveness and accessibility rather than technical advancement. The OEM approach provides market access to basic professional microphones without in-house innovation or scientific development focus. While the cost-effective positioning serves accessibility needs, the conservative approach shows limited progression toward transparent performance levels. The absence of measurement-focused development and reliance on mature technology without enhancement demonstrates minimal commitment to scientific advancement. The brand functions more as a distributor providing affordable alternatives rather than driving audio technology forward.

## Advice

The CM5S offers entry-level dynamic microphone functionality with convenient ON/OFF switching and included accessories. Consider this microphone for casual vocal applications, karaoke, or as backup equipment. At 13 USD, no cheaper dynamic microphones with equivalent or better functionality exist, making it the most cost-effective option available. The included hard case and microphone holder add practical value. Users requiring verified performance specifications should consider alternatives with published measurement data and broader frequency response for professional applications.
