## Overview

The Classic Pro CSP6 is a 2-way passive PA speaker under Sound House’s in-house brand. It uses a polypropylene cabinet and is specified at 8 Ω, 91 dB sensitivity, frequency response of 65 Hz–18 kHz (-3 dB) / 60 Hz–20 kHz (-10 dB), and a maximum SPL of 110 dB (+3 dB). Dimensions are 23 × 33 × 21 cm and weight is ~6.1 kg. It’s widely used in Japan for events and presentations where portability matters more than absolute fidelity. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

No independent third-party measurements were found. Manufacturer specs indicate a –3 dB bandwidth of 65 Hz–18 kHz, which falls short of a “transparent” ±3 dB 20 Hz–20 kHz target. The 91 dB figure is sensitivity (acoustic output for a given input), not SNR. Details such as cabinet bracing, distortion, and polar data are not published. Within those limits, the numbers are typical for a compact PA box. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Conventional 6.5″ woofer + 1″ HF driver, passive crossover, SpeakON input. No DSP, novel transducers, or patented acoustic features are advertised. This is a standard, cost-optimized design. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The CSP6 sells for ¥11,800 in Japan. Using the ECB reference rates for Aug 13, 2025 (≈¥147.27 per 1 USD), that equates to about **80.12 USD**. A cheapest equivalent-or-better benchmark we could verify is **Rockville RSG8** (single unit): 8″ 2-way, **55 Hz–20 kHz**, **90 dB**, MDF cabinet, **64.95 USD** direct from the manufacturer. Under our standard method against the cheapest equal-or-better option, the CSP6’s CP comes out to **0.8**. [1][2][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The retailer advertises a **3-year warranty** program on the product page, and replacement parts (e.g., 06LB050U woofer, CPD25II HF driver / CPD25IID diaphragm) are available, which supports serviceability. Quantitative durability or failure-rate data are not published; international support is limited. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Prioritizing portability, price, and easy mounting is coherent for casual PA and voice-forward use. For deeper bass headroom or measurement-backed performance, step up in size (e.g., CSP8/10/12/15) or compare MDF designs with published data (e.g., RSG8). [1][2]

## Advice

- Good fit for lightweight PA, speech, background music, small outdoor use.  
- Add a subwoofer or choose larger models if low-end output is important.  
- If you need wider measured bandwidth or more published data at this price, compare MDF-cabinet options such as Rockville RSG8. [2]
