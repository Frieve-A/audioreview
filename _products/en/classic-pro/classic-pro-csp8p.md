## Overview

The Classic Pro CSP8P is an 8-inch powered PA speaker from Classic Pro, a Japan-based brand focused on budget live sound gear. It’s a 2-way active box with an 8" woofer and 1" HF driver, using internal amplification rated at 100W RMS (LF) + 50W RMS (HF). The polypropylene cabinet keeps weight down for mobile use and small installs where portability matters more than maximum output [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

With a manufacturer-stated frequency response of 65Hz–18kHz (−3dB) and max SPL of 110dB, CSP8P falls short of full-range reproduction and headroom typical for modern PA tasks beyond small rooms. The horn coverage is 90°×60°. While the electronics distortion spec is low (LINE 0.02%, MIC 0.04%), no independent acoustic measurements (on-axis FR deviation, acoustic THD/IMD) are available. This section therefore relies on labeled manufacturer specs and indicates provisional performance pending third-party data [3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

CSP8P implements a conventional 2-way powered design with simple analog I/O (dual mic TS, line XLR, thru XLR) and a basic 2-band EQ. There is no onboard DSP (EQ presets, limiters with readout), networking, or app control disclosed. Amplifier topology is not specified publicly. Overall, it represents commodity engineering without notable novelty or platform features that push the category forward [3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Market price for CSP8P is about 200 USD (converted from a domestic 27,800円 listing) [3]. The Behringer B108D is an 8" powered speaker with similar or better user-facing functions (active 2-way, comparable frequency range 55Hz–20kHz at −10dB, wireless-ready) and higher claimed power (300W peak). It is widely available and cheaper at **145 USD** from a reputable US-facing retailer [1][2].  
**CP calculation:** 145 USD ÷ 200 USD = 0.725 → **0.7** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Classic Pro distribution and service are centered in Japan, primarily via Sound House. Outside Asia, official service channels are limited, which can complicate repairs or turnaround. No broad third-party reliability data or failure-rate statistics were found. Build uses a lightweight resin cabinet and basic components—adequate for light-duty use but likely less durable for heavy touring [3].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The product emphasizes low cost and portability over output, bandwidth, and system management. Given the absence of DSP or protection features beyond basics, and modest SPL/extension, the design choices do not target measured transparency or substantial headroom improvements. Slightly costlier models deliver meaningfully greater capability, so the direction is pragmatic but not performance-driven [1][2][3].

## Advice

CSP8P fits small rooms, speech, and background music where minimal cost and easy setup are priorities. If you need more output or broader bandwidth at low price, the **Behringer B108D** at 145 USD is a strong alternative with comparable features and higher claimed power [1][2]. For fitness studios, classrooms, or as a simple floor monitor on a budget, CSP8P can suffice; for louder gigs or fuller low end, step up to alternatives with higher SPL and DSP.
