## Overview

The Classic Pro CPH7000 is a closed-back monitor headphone sold under Sound House’s in-house **Classic Pro** brand [5]. It uses 40 mm neodymium dynamic drivers and a one-sided OFC cable, with 180° swivel cups for single-ear monitoring. As of the review date, the current market price is **40 USD** (Japan: **5,980円**) [2]. A measurement-oriented blog reports tuning broadly aligned with the Harman Target OE curve (with deviations mainly in lower mids to bass) [1], positioning the CPH7000 as an ultra-low-cost entry to measurement-guided studio monitoring.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent lab-grade datasets (THD, isolation, unit variance) are not yet available. Manufacturer specifications are: frequency response **10–30,000 Hz**, impedance **64 Ω**, sensitivity **108 dB/mW @1 kHz**, max input **1,000 mW**, mass **≈240 g** [2]. Third-party, measurement-based reviewing indicates a response generally tracking Harman OE with modest low-end deviation [1]. Given the lack of verified distortion/isolation figures (key audibility axes for headphones) and reliance on a single enthusiast measurement source, we set scientific validity slightly above the unknown baseline: **0.6** (baseline 0.5, +0.1 for plausible Harman-leaning FR evidence).

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The engineering is conventional: 40 mm neodymium dynamic drivers, closed-back construction, OFC straight cable, and 180° swivel cups. There is no evidence of proprietary acoustic IP, advanced materials, or novel driver architectures. Practical decisions (single-sided cable, screw-on 6.3 mm adapter) are sensible but not innovative [2]. Net: below-average technological originality despite competent execution.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Price basis (denominator):** CPH7000 **40 USD** [2].  
**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better):** **AKG K361**—closed-back studio monitor headphone with third-party measurements showing near-target FR behavior [4]; current US market price **135 USD** [3].  
**Equivalence note:** Both provide closed-back monitoring with broadly Harman-targeted FR (measured for K361; Harman-leaning for CPH7000 reported in [1]). No cheaper closed-back headphone with **equal-or-better** user-visible functions **and** credible, target-aligned measurements was found as of the review date [3][4].  
Therefore, **no cheaper equivalent exists** → **CP = 1.0** (clamped by rule).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Classic Pro is Sound House’s house brand [5]. Support is retailer-centric with parts/accessories available (e.g., spare earpads) and wide domestic distribution [2]. The design is simple (few moving parts), which tends to aid durability. However, verified failure-rate data and warranty term specifics are not clearly documented. With average expected reliability plus simple construction, we assess **0.6**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product emphasizes neutral-ish monitoring and essential usability over cosmetic or boutique features. Reported Harman-target alignment [1] indicates an evidence-based voicing decision; costs are focused on function (driver, enclosure, ergonomics) rather than mythology. While data transparency could improve (publish third-party FR/THD/isolation), the direction is rational and consumer-friendly.

## Advice

If you need closed-back monitoring on a minimal budget for DTM, recording practice, or edit checks, the CPH7000 is a uniquely low-cost on-ramp. Expect a bright-neutral presentation with slightly emphasized bass relative to strict Harman reports [1], practical swiveling cups, and standard adapters. Users requiring audited distortion curves, isolation numbers, or premium build should consider moving up to models with published independent measurements (e.g., AKG K361/K371) [4]. For price-driven studio utility, however, it is hard to beat the CPH7000’s combination of function and measurement-aware tuning at **40 USD**.
