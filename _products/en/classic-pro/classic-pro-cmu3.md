summary: "USB-C lavalier microphone for creators and remote meetings. Key specs are sparse; current street price effectively improves cost-performance when compared with the cheapest USB-C lavs that publish concrete specs."

## Overview

The Classic Pro CMU3 is a USB-C lavalier microphone in Sound House’s Classic Pro lineup. It uses an omnidirectional capsule and a 1.2 m cable for discreet clip-on use with iPhone 15/Android and PCs. Official retail now lists a limited price of **4,980円 (tax-in)** on Sound House, aligning to ~**33 USD** for this review’s denominator price. Pages with specs and placement: Sound House product page and retailer news/blog items. [1][4]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Catalog specs list **20 Hz–20 kHz** frequency response and **−35 dB ± 3 dB** sensitivity (USB-C, 1.2 m cable) [1]. Core transparency metrics—THD/THD+N, SNR, dynamic range, crosstalk, max SPL—are undisclosed, and no credible third-party measurements were found as of this date. The omni pattern suits lav usage, but without controlled measurements the audible-threshold relationship remains unverified, so the score stays at the baseline for unknown measurement performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The CMU3 appears to be a conventional electret lav paired with a standard USB audio interface. There is no disclosure of proprietary DSP, algorithms, or unusual transducer engineering; the “high-sensitivity” claim lacks technical documentation. This is consistent with typical OEM implementations rather than advanced design. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **BOYA BY-M3 (USB-C)** at **29.99 USD**. It matches the user-facing function set (USB-C, omnidirectional clip-on lav) and publishes concrete specs (e.g., **50–20,000 Hz** FR, **48 kHz** sampling). Given CMU3’s undisclosed measurement items, BY-M3’s published data and lower price justify using it as the baseline. [2][3]

*Note:* If you specifically want published **max SPL (110 dB)** and a 2 m cable from a major vendor, **Sennheiser XS Lav USB-C** is available at **49.99 USD**, albeit at a higher price point. [2][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a private-label Classic Pro item sold by Sound House, CMU3 benefits from the retailer’s sales infrastructure. Long-term, model-specific reliability data is unavailable, but the simple wired USB-C design reduces complexity relative to wireless systems. International support pathways remain limited. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Prioritizing USB-C plug-and-play for modern phones and PCs is practical, and the omni lav form factor fits creator/meeting workflows. However, absent measurement transparency, optimization intent is unclear; and with cheaper USB-C lavs providing clearer specs, competitive pressure is strong. [1][2]

## Advice

Choose CMU3 if you want a compact, wired **USB-C** lav from Sound House’s ecosystem at a low street price. If you prioritize **published specs and the lowest purchase cost**, the **BOYA BY-M3 (29.99 USD)** is the better value. If you need documented **max SPL** and accessory quality from a major brand, consider the **Sennheiser XS Lav USB-C (49.99 USD)**. [2][3]
