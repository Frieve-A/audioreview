summary: "The TRN VX Pro is a 9-driver (1DD+8BA) hybrid IEM, but at 88 USD, it suffers from poor cost-performance as competitors like the 7Hz Zero (20 USD) offer equivalent functionality and performance for around 20 USD."

## Overview

TRN is a daughter brand of Dongguan Zudu Acoustic Technology Co., Ltd., founded in 2017 in China by two engineers and audio enthusiasts as an IEM manufacturer. The VX Pro is the company's 2021 flagship model, featuring a hybrid configuration with a 10mm carbon nanotube dynamic driver combined with 8 custom BA drivers. It utilizes an aviation-grade magnesium alloy housing manufactured through 5-axis CNC machining and includes a 4-core silver-plated copper cable.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The frequency response shows a V-shaped characteristic in the 7Hz-40kHz range. The specifications of 106dB sensitivity and 22ฮฉ impedance allow adequate driving even from smartphones. However, specific measured data for THD, SNR, and crosstalk are not publicly available. Regarding noise isolation, some measurements indicate average passive isolation performance. Due to limited measurement data, evaluation of transparent-level achievement is difficult, but current data suggests average performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While the 9-driver configuration (1DD+8BA) is numerically impressive, these are combinations of existing driver units with limited technological innovation in proprietary design. The carbon nanotube diaphragm and dual magnetic cavity design are adopted, but these are technologies that have become commonplace in the industry. The 3-way crossover design divides frequency bands appropriately, but the technical achievement remains at industry average levels. The 5-axis CNC machining of the magnesium alloy housing contributes to improved texture, but its scientific effect on sound quality is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The TRN VX Pro is priced at 88 USD, but the 7Hz Zero (20 USD) exists offering equivalent functionality and performance. The 7Hz Zero provides instrument separation, detail reproduction, and imaging performance, with tuning switches allowing adjustment from bass-head oriented to transparent neutral bass. The calculation: 20 USD รท 88 USD = 0.23, rounded to a score of 0.2. Additionally, competitors such as the Moondrop CHU (20 USD) and KZ ZS10 Pro (50 USD) also exist, making the TRN VX Pro's price advantage significantly low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

TRN has a rich product lineup, with products like the MT1 Pro offering a 1-year manufacturing defect warranty. However, past reviews have noted quality issues with included cables. Recent products show improved reliability of 2-pin connectors, but overall the support system is judged to be at industry average levels. With 8 years since company establishment, continuity as a medium-scale manufacturer can be confirmed.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 3-way crossover design with 9-driver configuration is theoretically a rational approach that can be expected to optimize each frequency band. The V-shaped tuning is a characteristic preferred by many users, and the direction of balancing entertainment and technical aspects is rational. However, given the current situation where excellent single-driver competitors (such as the 7Hz Zero) achieve equivalent or superior performance at significantly lower prices, the necessity of multi-driver configurations raises questions regarding the increased cost and complexity. There is also a tendency to rely on subjective evaluation rather than objective evaluation based on measurement data.

## Advice

The TRN VX Pro is technically a standard hybrid IEM, but multiple alternatives with clear price advantages exist for its 88 USD price point. Particularly, the 7Hz Zero (20 USD) receives equivalent or superior evaluations in instrument separation, detail reproduction, and imaging performance, with no clear advantages confirmed to justify the more than 4x price difference. For those considering purchase, we recommend first trying the 7Hz Zero or Moondrop CHU around 20 USD, and only consider higher-priced products if these don't satisfy your needs. Unless you find special value in the TRN brand or multi-driver configuration, we cannot recommend this product from a cost-performance perspective.
