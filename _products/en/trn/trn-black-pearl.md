## Overview

The TRN Black Pearl is a portable DAC/amplifier developed by TRN Audio from China. It features dual CS43131 DAC chips and a CB5100 USB bridge chip, supporting PCM up to 384kHz/32-bit and DSD256. The compact 57mm×23mm×13mm form factor houses both 4.4mm balanced output and 3.5mm single-ended output. The company has steadily built its market position as a mid-price range audio equipment manufacturer since 2015, particularly known for deploying numerous products with excellent cost-performance ratios.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The TRN Black Pearl's measurement results demonstrate excellent performance approaching transparent levels. The SNR of 130dB@4.4mm and THD+N of -110dB@4.4mm/2Vrms significantly exceed the transparent level criteria (SNR 105dB or above, THD 0.01% or below). The dynamic range of 130dB also achieves transparent levels, meaning virtually no audible sound quality degradation occurs within the audible range. The excellent design of the CS43131 chips and performance improvements from the dual configuration are reflected in these measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The dual CS43131 DAC configuration represents a technically advanced approach. Combined with the CB5100 USB bridge chip, it achieves high sampling rate support and DSD256 compatibility. The 8-band EQ controllable via software also represents modern design. However, it is fundamentally a combination of existing chips, with limited innovation through proprietary development. The implementation of dual configuration in a compact size demonstrates commendable technical capability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 37 USD, there are no equivalent or superior products offering balanced output, software EQ functionality, and dual DAC configuration at a lower price. For users requiring balanced output or advanced EQ, higher-end models like the Qudelix 5K (109 USD) and FiiO KA17 (108 USD) cost approximately three times more. While cheaper alternatives exist for basic DAC/amplifier functions, the Black Pearl excels in delivering this feature set at a low cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

TRN has maintained stable product supply since its establishment in 2015, with product defect rates below industry average. The company provides a 12-month product warranty and has established support systems through major retailers. While firmware updates are not supported, the hardware-based stable operation makes it suitable for long-term use. It belongs to the reliable category among Chinese manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy of achieving transparent-level measurement performance at 37 USD is extremely rational. The integration of performance improvements through dual DAC configuration, compact implementation, and software EQ support represents a modern approach unified at low cost. As dedicated audio equipment, it provides balanced output and high power output that would be difficult to achieve with general-purpose smartphones, justifying its necessity. The development approach prioritizing performance based on measurement data is also scientifically rational.

## Advice

The TRN Black Pearl is suitable for users who value balanced output and dual DAC configuration. It achieves transparent-level performance with SNR 130dB and THD+N -110dB at 37 USD. However, for basic DAC/amplifier functionality alone, the FiiO KA11 (29.99 USD) offers higher output at lower cost as an alternative. The Black Pearl's value is realized when you need the balanced output (4.4mm) with 320mW output or software EQ functionality. If you prioritize Bluetooth connectivity or more advanced EQ features, consider higher-end models like the Qudelix 5K (109 USD). We recommend carefully considering the necessity of balanced connection before purchase.
