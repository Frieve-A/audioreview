## Overview

The TRN Black Pearl is a portable DAC/headphone amplifier featuring dual CS43131 DAC chips and CB5100 USB bridge. At 37 USD, it provides 4.4mm balanced and 3.5mm single-ended outputs with 384kHz/32-bit PCM and DSD256 support, plus 10-band parametric EQ via WALK PLAY APP.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Third-party measurements from Audio Science Review [1] demonstrate THD+N of -110dB (0.000316%), significantly exceeding the excellent threshold of 0.01% for DAC/amplifier products. Dynamic range reaches 132.7dB with DRE enabled, well above the transparent threshold of 105dB. SINAD achieves excellent ratings comparable to Tanchjim Space. SNR performance reaches 130dB at 4.4mm balanced output, clearing the 105dB transparent threshold. Output impedance measures 0.12Ω (balanced) and 0.22-0.23Ω (unbalanced), suitable for sensitive IEMs. Score reflects most metrics achieving excellent performance levels with transparent-level results across key indicators.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The TRN Black Pearl employs entirely standard technologies without proprietary innovations. Dual CS43131 DACs date from 2015, representing established Cirrus Logic designs widely used across the industry [2]. The CB5100 USB bridge provides common DSP functionality found in numerous competing products. ODM manufacturing by TTGK indicates no in-house development or unique circuit design. All components are commercially available, making the architecture easily replicable by competitors with no lasting technological advantages or patent protection.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

CP = 1.0 (no cheaper equivalent-or-better product exists). After comprehensive analysis, no products were identified offering equivalent measured performance (THD+N -110dB, 132.7dB dynamic range, SINAD excellent level) and equivalent functions (4.4mm balanced output, 10-band parametric EQ, 384kHz/32-bit support) at a lower price point. Candidates like Apple USB-C dongle (9-19 USD) lack balanced outputs and EQ functionality, while JCally JM20 (24 USD) and Tempotec Sonata HD Pro (30-54 USD) miss critical features or show measurement weaknesses. The review target represents the cheapest option achieving this specific combination of verified performance and user-facing capabilities.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

TRN provides 1-2 year warranty coverage depending on retailer, with global support through authorized distributors including Linsoul Audio and HiFiGo [3]. The manufacturer demonstrates proactive firmware development, releasing V0.3 in August 2025 to address DRE-induced distortion issues after user feedback. Support operates Monday-Friday 09:00-18:00 (UTC+8) with 2 working day response times. Build quality features all-metal construction with tempered glass panels, running cool during extended use. However, warranty periods are relatively standard rather than exceptional, limiting the reliability assessment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

TRN demonstrates rational, measurement-focused design philosophy prioritizing functional performance over aesthetics [4]. Cost allocation heavily favors technical capabilities (dual DACs, balanced outputs, DSP EQ) rather than premium materials or brand positioning. At 37 USD, the approach efficiently utilizes modern manufacturing and proven chip technologies to deliver transparent-level performance typically associated with products costing 200+ USD. While using standard implementations rather than innovative approaches, the design philosophy proves scientifically sound and cost-effective, successfully achieving measurable improvements through rational engineering choices.

## Advice

The TRN Black Pearl suits users requiring verified transparent-level DAC/amplifier performance with balanced output capability and comprehensive EQ functionality at minimal cost. Ideal for IEM users needing low output impedance and high-resolution format support. The device excels as a cost-effective upgrade from basic USB adapters while maintaining portable form factor. Consider firmware updates via WALK PLAY APP for optimal performance. Not recommended for users prioritizing premium aesthetics or requiring higher power output for demanding headphones, as the focus remains on technical performance rather than luxury presentation or maximum amplification capability.
