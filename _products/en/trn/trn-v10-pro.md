summary: "A multi-driver IEM with a 2DD+2BA setup. It offers excellent cost-performance, but its scientific fidelity is limited by V-shaped tuning, and cheaper, better-performing alternatives exist."

## Overview

The TRN V10 Pro is a hybrid earphone developed by Chinese audio manufacturer TRN, featuring a 2DD+2BA configuration. It incorporates a 10mm beryllium-coated dynamic driver, a 6mm titanium-coated dynamic driver, and two 30095 high-frequency balanced armature drivers. In the Japanese market, it is sold for 2,350 JPY, achieving a rare 4-driver configuration at this price point. With specifications of 20Hz-20kHz frequency response, 112dB sensitivity, and 22Ω impedance, it adopts V-shaped acoustic tuning.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The TRN V10 Pro's measured performance remains at industry-average levels. While the nominal frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz covers the standard range, the actual characteristics are V-shaped tuned with boosts in the low and high frequencies. This deviates from neutrality in terms of scientific fidelity. The 112dB sensitivity value is within an appropriate range, but detailed THD measurement data and actual S/N ratio data are limited. Although the hybrid configuration provides relatively good reproduction across frequency bands, the intentional V-shaped tuning causes midrange recession, limiting complete fidelity to master sources. Measurable improvements confirmed within the audible range are limited, resulting in a standard-level of scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the TRN V10 Pro has technical complexity with its 2DD+2BA configuration, the implementation level falls below the industry average. The design combining two dynamic drivers (10mm beryllium-coated and 6mm titanium-coated) with two 30095 BA drivers is theoretically excellent, but crossover design optimization is insufficient. It fails to fully utilize the characteristics of each driver, and the advantages of the 4-driver configuration do not clearly manifest in sound quality. While the 4-driver implementation at this price point is noteworthy, the basic design philosophy and implementation technology strongly resemble off-the-shelf combinations, lacking originality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

This product's cost-performance is evaluated based on its final measured performance, not its driver configuration. The V10 Pro's performance is at an industry-average level, but there are products with better, more scientifically faithful (neutral) measured performance available for less. For example, the **7Hz Salnotes Zero**, known for its neutral sound signature, can be purchased for a lower price of around **2,200 JPY**. Using this as the comparison, the calculation is `2,200 JPY ÷ 2,350 JPY ≈ 0.936`. After rounding, the score is 0.9. While it has the feature of a multi-driver setup, it is not the best value when judged on pure acoustic performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

TRN is an emerging manufacturer established in 2017, lacking a long-term reliability track record. While products come with a 1-year manufacturing defect warranty, the support structure in the Japanese market is limited. Sales on Amazon.co.jp show reports of quality variations and initial defects. Particularly, the 4-driver implementation at this price point increases quality control difficulty and heightens the risk of unit-to-unit variation. The repair system is also unclear, and after-sales support quality is judged to be near the industry's minimum standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The TRN V10 Pro's design philosophy contains a mixture of rational and irrational elements. The approach of optimizing frequency bands with a 2DD+2BA configuration is theoretically rational, and the adoption of different diaphragm materials (beryllium coating and titanium coating) represents an appropriate direction for sound quality improvement. However, the intentional adoption of V-shaped tuning prioritizes subjective "enjoyment" over scientific transparency, which is irrational from the perspective of fidelity to master sources. While achieving a hybrid configuration at this price point has technical value, its contribution to achieving a transparent level according to measurement criteria is limited. Overall, the technical direction is valid, but there is room for improvement in the tuning philosophy.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the TRN V10 Pro, I recommend making a selection after clarifying your usage and sound quality priorities. It is an option for those who find a technical appeal in the multi-driver configuration and seek a fun, V-shaped sound signature. However, if you prioritize scientific fidelity, you should be aware that products like the **7Hz Salnotes Zero (approx. 2,200 JPY)** exist with superior measured performance at a lower price. Furthermore, if you are willing to spend a bit more for a well-refined tuning, the **Moondrop Chu II (approx. 3,960 JPY)** is also a strong contender. If you choose the V10 Pro, it is important to limit its use primarily to entertainment purposes and to purchase it with an understanding of the risks of quality variation.
