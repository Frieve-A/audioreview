## Overview

The TRN Xuanwu represents an ambitious attempt to bring planar magnetic technology to the budget IEM market. Launched by the Chinese manufacturer TRN in 2022, this hybrid earphone combines a 10mm square planar driver with a custom balanced armature, targeting smartphone users with its low 12Ω impedance. While the concept shows promise for democratizing planar technology, the execution reveals compromises in acoustic engineering optimization, though comprehensive measurement data is not publicly available for objective evaluation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measured data. While user reports indicate issues with bass distortion and treble harshness [1][2], these subjective evaluations cannot be used as measurement data per meta-review principles. Manufacturer-published specifications confirm frequency response 20Hz–20kHz, sensitivity 117dB, and impedance 12Ω [4]. However, measurement conditions and quantitative values for THD/IMD and frequency response deviation (±dB) are not disclosed. Without objective measurement data for key parameters (THD, frequency response deviation, distortion at various levels), Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 pending availability of proper measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Xuanwu incorporates a 10x10mm square planar driver paired with a custom balanced armature in a hybrid configuration. While the implementation of planar technology at this price point demonstrates cost-effective engineering, the design lacks innovation beyond basic cost reduction. The square planar driver geometry is competent but represents mature rather than cutting-edge technology. The hybrid crossover design shows appropriate technical execution, though the final acoustic result suggests limitations in the acoustic engineering optimization. The aluminum alloy faceplate and detachable cable system meet contemporary standards but offer no competitive technical advantages.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Per policy, internal construction (e.g., driver types) must not be used as comparison criteria [5]. We therefore compare strictly on user-facing functionality and measured/spec-confirmed performance availability. With current market price at 30 USD for the Xuanwu, the cheapest equivalent-or-better option we identified is MOONDROP CHU, which publishes official frequency response and key specifications on its product page [6], and is widely available at 19.99–20 USD [7]. Using USD basis:

CP = 20 USD ÷ 30 USD = 0.7

Rounded to one decimal place, the Cost-Performance score is 0.7.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

TRN, a daughter brand of Dongguan Zudu Acoustic Technology Co., Ltd. founded in 2017, provides limited warranty information and primarily dealer-based support infrastructure. The company lacks the global support network of established manufacturers, with most support handled through distributors. The simple driver construction reduces potential points of failure, though the planar drivers may be susceptible to damage from overpowering. No established track record exists for long-term reliability, and repair costs may be prohibitive given the product's low price point.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

TRN's approach prioritizes market accessibility over scientific audio optimization. While the cost-effective implementation of planar technology serves the rational goal of technology democratization, the final product demonstrates compromises in acoustic engineering. The V-shaped tuning philosophy emphasizes entertainment value over accuracy, based on subjective user reports of distortion and frequency response issues. The design shows insufficient attention to measurement-based optimization, lacking published measurement data to verify transparency levels despite the underlying technology's potential for high-fidelity reproduction.

## Advice

The TRN Xuanwu serves as the most affordable entry point to planar magnetic technology, making it ideal for users curious about planar sound characteristics on a minimal budget. At 30 USD, it offers unmatched cost-performance in the planar magnetic category, with no cheaper alternatives providing equivalent functionality. However, potential buyers should understand that Scientific Validity cannot be properly assessed due to lack of measurement data, requiring reliance on subjective user reports. Users prioritizing verified performance metrics should consider investing in products with published measurement data, though at significantly higher price points like the KZ PR3 at 50 USD.
