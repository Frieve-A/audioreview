## Overview

TRN TE Pro is a compact USB DAC/amp using **dual CS43198** DACs with an **OLED display**, **3.5 mm SE** and **4.4 mm balanced** outputs, and an uncommon **S/PDIF coaxial output via the 3.5 mm jack** (menu-switchable). It supports up to **PCM 32-bit/768 kHz** and **DSD256**. As of Aug 29, 2025, the representative street price is **95.99 USD**. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent third-party measurements were not found at review time; the following **manufacturer specifications with stated conditions** are used provisionally: **SNR (A-wt, 32 Ω)** 125 dB (SE), 130 dB (BAL); **THD+N (@100 mW, 32 Ω)** −108 dB (SE), −106 dB (BAL); **Crosstalk (@10 mW, 32 Ω)** −68 dB (SE), −117 dB (BAL); **Max power (@32 Ω)** 125 mW×2 (SE), 240 mW×2 (BAL). These figures indicate ample headroom on BAL; SE crosstalk is comparatively weaker and may be the limiting factor in worst cases. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A dual-CS43198 dongle with 32/768 and DSD256 is mainstream in 2024–2025. The **OLED UI** and **menu-switchable S/PDIF via 3.5 mm** are practical differentiators, but the decoding/amplification path is a conventional, well-executed design. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Current price (review target):** **95.99 USD**. Comparator (cheapest “not-inferior” on core playback functions & output): **Colorfly CDA-M1P — 79.99 USD** with **3.5/4.4 mm outputs**, **up to 240 mW @32 Ω (BAL) / 125 mW @32 Ω (SE)**, and **PCM 32/768 + DSD512**. It **lacks OLED/S/PDIF**, which **do not affect analog playback fidelity** and are excluded from equivalence judgment here. **CP calculation:** 79.99 USD ÷ 95.99 USD = **0.83** → **0.8** (rounded to one decimal). [2][4][5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Simple solid-state construction and no battery suggest baseline reliability; warranty and support are handled via dealers/distributors. Long-term field data for TE Pro specifically is limited, and firmware/driver maturity depends on the USB bridge/controller ecosystem. [1][2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Engineering choices emphasize measurable transparency and usability: dual DACs, adequate output power for portable loads, and an OLED interface for clear control. Adding S/PDIF output increases flexibility without compromising the core analog path, representing a rational, user-centric feature set at the price. [1]

## Advice

Prefer the **4.4 mm balanced** output for the best crosstalk and headroom; use SE when convenience is paramount. If you do not need a screen or S/PDIF and want to minimize spend while keeping comparable **analog** output capability, **CDA-M1P** is a sensible lower-cost option. For significantly higher voltage into high-impedance headphones, consider stepping up to larger dongles or small desktop units. [1][2][4][6]
