## Overview

The TRN VX Pro Plus is a 1DD+8BA hybrid earphone from TRN, a Chinese audio manufacturer established in 2017. It features a 10mm beryllium diaphragm dynamic driver and eight custom balanced armature drivers (four for the midrange, four for the treble), sold for 45.99 USD (about 6,900 yen). Positioned as the premium model in the company's VX series, it adopts a mild V-shaped sound tuning.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The frequency response covers a wide range from 7Hz to 40kHz, but the "mild V-shaped" tuning noted in reviews indicates a deviation from flat reproduction characteristics. The specifications of 32Ω impedance and 106dB sensitivity are within a reasonable range, but detailed measurement data (THD, SNR, crosstalk, etc.) is not publicly available. While the hybrid configuration reportedly provides relatively good reproduction across frequency bands, the midrange recession caused by the V-shaped tuning limits its scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design, incorporating a 10mm dual magnetic circuit dynamic driver with a beryllium diaphragm and eight custom BA drivers arranged by frequency band, represents an appropriate technical implementation for this price range. The specification of concrete BA model numbers—four 50060-type units for the midrange and four 30095-type units for the treble—demonstrates technical transparency. However, these technologies represent an industry-standard implementation without notable technical innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Against the TRN VX Pro Plus's price of 45.99 USD, the Moondrop Chu II, which offers equivalent or superior sound quality performance, is available for approximately 20 USD. The Chu II, despite its single dynamic driver configuration, reportedly demonstrates superior tuning and measurement results. The cost-performance calculation is 20 USD ÷ 45.99 USD = 0.435, which rounds to 0.4. This represents a typical case where the complexity of a hybrid configuration does not necessarily contribute to an improvement in sound quality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

TRN is a relatively new company established in 2017, and its products come with a one-year warranty for manufacturing defects. The company maintains standard support structures for a Chinese earphone manufacturer, but long-term quality data and the adequacy of its repair system remain unknown. Past reviews have noted "failures in early high-priced products," making an industry-average reliability assessment appropriate.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design philosophy of optimizing drivers by frequency band is rational, and the adoption of beryllium diaphragms represents an appropriate approach to sound quality improvement. However, the adoption of V-shaped tuning appears to prioritize subjective "enjoyment" over scientific transparency. Considering the price range, the technical direction is reasonable, but the pursuit of more transparent sound quality is insufficient.

## Advice

The TRN VX Pro Plus is a technically well-designed hybrid earphone, but superior alternatives exist in the same price range. Particularly, the Moondrop Chu II offers better tuning at less than half the price, making it unsuitable for sound-quality-focused buyers. Even for those attracted to hybrid configurations, alternatives like the KZ ZS10 Pro at a similar price with a better track record should be considered. At the current price point, the product's technical value is not appropriately reflected in its market pricing. For those considering a purchase, we strongly recommend either waiting for a significant price drop or choosing a more rational alternative.
