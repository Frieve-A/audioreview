## Overview

The TRN VX is a 7-driver hybrid in-ear monitor developed by TRN Audio of China. It features 6 balanced armature drivers (3×Knowles 30095, 3×Knowles 50060) and 1×10mm dynamic driver, housed in a CNC-machined magnesium alloy shell. With specifications of 22Ω impedance, 107dB/mW sensitivity, and 7-40,000Hz frequency range, it comes in emerald green and black color options. Priced around 10,000 JPY, it is noted for excellent resolution and technical capability, while its bright V-shaped tuning causes listening fatigue concerns.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The TRN VX's measurements reveal significant issues from a scientific transparency perspective. The most critical problem is the pronounced peak around 8kHz, which severely compromises auditory comfort. This peak produces clearly audible acoustic effects exceeding the threshold of perception, causing the "listening fatigue" and "overly stimulating" character reported in numerous reviews. The excessive emphasis in the upper midrange gives vocals a "shouting" impression, while certain percussion instruments sound "sharp and aggressive." The bass response emphasizes mid-bass while subduing sub-bass, lacking overall spectral balance. While the V-shaped characteristic certainly produces audible differences, it significantly deviates from transparent reproduction and reaches problematic levels regarding fidelity to master sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

From a technical perspective, the TRN VX achieves a reasonable standard. The 7-driver hybrid configuration is complex, and the adoption of Knowles BA drivers represents an industry-standard approach. The CNC-machined magnesium alloy housing balances lightness with rigidity, demonstrating commendable manufacturing technique. Resolution and instrument separation capabilities are excellent for the price range, with soundstage width surpassing competitors at similar price points. However, driver integration and crossover design show room for improvement, as evidenced by problems like the 8kHz peak. The technologies employed remain combinations of existing methods, with no innovative proprietary techniques observed. This represents average achievement by current technical standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The TRN VX's current market price is approximately 10,000 JPY, but alternatives with equivalent or superior functionality and performance exist, including the Moondrop CHU (2,200 JPY) and CCA CRA (2,000 JPY). These single-driver IEMs provide similar resolution and acoustic performance to the TRN VX while achieving superior acoustic balance. The Moondrop CHU particularly avoids the TRN VX's problematic 8kHz peak through neutral tuning, offering more natural acoustic characteristics. Calculation: 2,200 JPY ÷ 10,000 JPY = 0.22, rounded to 0.2. The approximately 8,000 JPY price difference cannot be justified solely by multiple drivers or premium materials. With multiple products providing equivalent or superior acoustic experiences at significantly lower prices, the cost-performance must be evaluated as poor.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

As an emerging Chinese audio brand, TRN Audio's reliability is a concern. Reports of initial defects, such as driver imbalances and shell adhesive failures, are occasionally found in online communities, suggesting inconsistencies in product quality. While the 2-pin detachable cable aids in maintenance, the overall quality control cannot be considered stable. Official distributor support is limited in many regions, with purchases often made through overseas mail order, making it more difficult to resolve issues compared to major brands. There is also a lack of data on long-term durability, making it difficult to assess that the brand meets industry-average reliability standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The TRN VX's design philosophy shows rational approaches in some areas but overall problems exist. The 7-driver hybrid configuration itself is acoustically engineering-sound, with the concept of dedicated drivers for each frequency band being valid. Adopting lightweight, rigid magnesium alloy housing is rational from a vibration control perspective. However, the final acoustic tuning's intentional V-shaped characteristic lacks scientific rationality. The pronounced 8kHz peak particularly represents prioritizing "excitement" over acoustic transparency, deviating from high-fidelity reproduction goals. More problematic is that technology capable of achieving more transparent acoustic characteristics at the same cost already exists in the market. Considering products like the Moondrop CHU achieve more natural tuning at less than one-fifth the price, the TRN VX's design direction must be evaluated as irrational.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the TRN VX, we strongly recommend thoroughly examining alternative options in the same price range first. With a 10,000 JPY budget, you can select products with superior acoustic balance. Particularly for those prioritizing acoustic fidelity, alternatives like the Moondrop CHU (2,200 JPY) or CCA CRA (2,000 JPY) provide vastly superior cost-performance. These single-driver products avoid the TRN VX's 8kHz peak problem while achieving more natural acoustic characteristics. Even if you prefer multi-driver configurations or premium appearance, ensure you audition before purchase to confirm the listening fatigue issue is acceptable. For extended music listening sessions, the TRN VX's stimulating treble characteristics may significantly compromise comfort. We recommend effective budget utilization by considering more scientifically superior alternatives.
