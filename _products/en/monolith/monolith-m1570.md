## Overview

The Monolith M1570 represents Monoprice's entry into premium planar magnetic headphones, featuring large 106mm drivers with Linear Symmetry Magnets in an open-back design. Positioned as a cost-effective alternative to high-end competitors like the Audeze LCD-X, the M1570 includes dual earpad sets (lambskin and velour), mini 4-pin XLR connectivity, and a comprehensive 5-year warranty. The headphones target audiophiles seeking planar magnetic performance at accessible pricing through Monoprice's direct-sourcing business model.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The M1570 demonstrates good measured performance with credible third-party validation from G.R.A.S. laboratory equipment testing [1]. Frequency response measurements show flat performance below 1kHz and a controlled +4dB peak at 3kHz, significantly better than typical planar magnetics with excessive treble peaks. However, third-party measurements confirm the lambskin earpads exhibit problematic resonances and a concerning null between 1-2kHz, while velour pads provide notably flatter response [1]. Audio Science Review measurements using standardized Gras 45C equipment verify these findings, showing the faux leather pads create rough frequency response patterns indicating resonances. THD specification of <0.1% @ 100dB demonstrates excellent measured performance with third-party confirmation of inaudible distortion even at extremely loud levels. Third-party sensitivity measurement of 101.1dB/mW significantly exceeds the manufacturer specification of 96dB/mW and provides highly efficient operation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The M1570 represents solid contemporary technology with moderate differentiation through its 106mm planar magnetic drivers and Linear Symmetry Magnets system. The dual magnet array and proprietary magnetic structure suggest in-house development rather than OEM sourcing. Driver size exceeds most competitors and provides theoretical advantages for reduced distortion and improved dynamics. However, the design relies purely on analog/mechanical approaches without digital integration or cutting-edge technologies like DSP or wireless connectivity. The technology represents appropriate contemporary planar magnetic implementation but lacks significant innovation beyond driver scaling and magnetic optimization.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At 599 USD current market price, the M1570 faces strong competition from equivalent-or-better alternatives. The HiFiMan Sundara provides superior measured frequency response with flatter 1-2kHz range eliminating the M1570's problematic null with lambskin pads, adequate sensitivity (94dB), and significantly better comfort at 229 USD current market price [2]. Third-party measurements from Audio Science Review and SoundStage! confirm the Sundara's more linear frequency response across the critical midrange frequencies where the M1570 exhibits resonance issues with faux leather pads, while both products provide equivalent planar magnetic technology and open-back design. CP = 229 USD ÷ 599 USD = 0.38, rounded to 0.4.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The M1570 offers a strong 5-year warranty significantly exceeding industry standard 2-year coverage [1]. However, reliability concerns include user reports of internal connectivity issues requiring temporary fixes by squeezing the earcups, and driver failures necessitating warranty replacement [3]. Monoprice's customer service has historically received poor ratings with complaints of unanswered emails and inadequate follow-up, though recent reports indicate some improvement with faster parts shipping for warranty issues [4]. The robust planar magnetic design provides inherent durability advantages, but documented connectivity and driver failures offset the extended warranty benefits.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Monoprice demonstrates largely rational design philosophy through direct manufacturer sourcing that eliminates markup layers while maintaining performance focus [5]. The business model directly contributes to cost optimization without compromising measurable performance parameters. The dual earpad system provides meaningful sound tuning options with measurable frequency response differences. Technology adoption remains conservative but appropriate, using proven planar magnetic approaches without unnecessary premium materials or subjective design elements. The M1570 represents clear advancement over earlier M1060 series in driver technology and measured performance. However, the approach remains somewhat conservative compared to companies actively integrating digital processing, wireless technologies, or advanced materials science.

## Advice

The M1570 offers solid measured performance for planar magnetic enthusiasts who prioritize the extended warranty and don't mind significant weight (670g). Choose velour earpads for better frequency response linearity, avoiding the lambskin pads' resonance issues and 1-2kHz null. However, the HiFiMan Sundara provides superior measured performance, dramatically better comfort, and costs 370 USD less. Unless the 5-year warranty is specifically valuable for your use case, the Sundara represents better overall value. For users sensitive to headphone weight or requiring extended listening sessions, consider lighter alternatives like the Dan Clark Audio Æon 2 series. Ensure adequate amplification for the 60-ohm impedance, though efficiency is sufficient for most consumer sources.
