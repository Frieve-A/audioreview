## Overview

The Amulech AL-9628D is a Japanese-manufactured USB DAC and headphone amplifier featuring PCM5102A DAC technology with OCL (Output Capacitor Less) design. This compact aluminum-chassis unit supports PCM audio up to 96kHz/32-bit and DSD formats via ASIO 2.1, targeting Hi-Res audio enthusiasts seeking transparent sound reproduction. Developed by Amulech, a boutique audio manufacturer from Niigata, Japan, the AL-9628D represents an in-house designed solution with dual USB/AC power operation and digital coaxial output capability.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Customer reviews report S/N ratio and dynamic range both at 110dB, exceeding transparent level thresholds (>105dB) according to measurement criteria [2]. Official manufacturer specifications are limited to PCM sampling rates and output power levels [1]. The PCM5102A DAC chip specification supports 112dB S/N ratio, aligning with customer-reported performance levels. However, critical measurements including THD, IMD, frequency response, and crosstalk remain unavailable from independent third-party verification sources. Conservative evaluation applies due to reliance on customer reports rather than verified third-party measurements, with baseline scoring reflecting incomplete measurement data availability. The absence of comprehensive independent measurement data prevents higher scientific validity scoring despite promising customer-reported specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AL-9628D demonstrates competent engineering through in-house Japanese design and OCL implementation eliminating capacitors from the signal path [2]. Contemporary PCM5102A DAC adoption with DSD Native ASIO support represents appropriate technology integration for the development period. Manufacturing control through domestic production shows technical commitment, while the OCL design reveals engineering consideration for signal path optimization. However, technology adoption remains standard rather than innovative, lacking proprietary patents or significant technical differentiation beyond basic implementation choices. Limited innovation beyond industry standards constrains higher technology evaluation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The AL-9628D is discontinued from mainstream retail, with used units available on secondary markets. Using original retail price for comparison: 105 USD. The FiiO KA13 provides equivalent-or-better functionality with dual CS43131 DAC chips, PCM 384kHz/32-bit and DSD256 support (superior to AL-9628D's 96kHz PCM and basic DSD), 550mW high power output (superior to 110mW), USB Type-C connectivity, and both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs, priced at 76 USD [3]. Equipped with superior DAC implementation, headphone amplification with higher output power, and additional balanced output functionality, the KA13's specifications and features are equivalent-or-better than the review target. CP = 76 USD ÷ 105 USD = 0.72, rounded to 0.7.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Simple aluminum chassis construction with minimal moving parts suggests inherent reliability potential. However, customer reports document volume control fluctuation issues at low volumes and design revision history (VER B board) indicating previous functional problems requiring correction [4]. Manufacturer warranty terms and international support infrastructure remain unclear, with primary support channels appearing domestically focused in Japan. The documented quality control concerns regarding volume control performance and limited global support presence reduce reliability confidence below baseline expectations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

OCL design philosophy demonstrates scientifically rational approach by eliminating unnecessary capacitors from signal paths, aligning with measurement-oriented audio goals [4]. Emphasis on "flat, pure" sound characteristics supports objective rather than subjective design priorities. In-house Japanese manufacturing approach shows production control commitment. However, cost allocation fails to demonstrate superior measured performance compared to available alternatives, with price premium unjustified by functional advantages. While OCL implementation and neutral sound emphasis indicate consistent scientific design philosophy, questionable cost-effectiveness relative to market alternatives balances the evaluation.

## Advice

For potential purchasers seeking Japanese-manufactured USB DAC solutions with transparent sound characteristics, the AL-9628D offers competent OCL design engineering and domestic production quality control. However, the product is discontinued from mainstream retail with only secondary market availability. Consider alternatives like the FiiO KA13 providing superior specifications (dual CS43131 DACs, 384kHz vs 96kHz PCM support, 550mW vs 110mW output power, balanced outputs) at comparable cost. The AL-9628D suits buyers specifically valuing Japanese boutique manufacturing and OCL implementation, understanding the availability constraints for these characteristics. Due to reported volume control issues and limited measurement data, prospective users should verify unit functionality and consider warranty implications before purchase.
