## Overview

The Noble Audio FALCON2 represents the company's first venture into completely wireless earphones, developed under the guidance of Dr. John Moulton, an audiologist known as "Wizard" who founded Noble Audio in 2013. As the successor to the original FALCON, the FALCON2 aims to embody high quality and ease of use with aptX Adaptive codec support, 10-hour battery life, and IPX7 water resistance. Noble Audio brings their established expertise in custom in-ear monitors to the true wireless segment, emphasizing scientific principles informed by Dr. Moulton's audiological background.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. No credible third-party measurements are available for the Noble Audio FALCON2, and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant measurement data beyond basic frequency range claims (20Hz-20kHz). All critical measurement criteria including THD, S/N ratio, frequency response deviation, and passive isolation performance remain unavailable for evaluation [2]. While the product includes passive noise reduction capability, no decibel measurements are provided to assess its effectiveness against the transparent level criteria of 30dB or above for headphones.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The FALCON2 employs standard contemporary TWS technologies without notable innovation or proprietary advancements. Core components include the Qualcomm QCC3040 chip, Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, and aptX Adaptive codec support - all representing mainstream technology adoption rather than cutting-edge development [3]. The 6mm drivers and dual-microphone noise-canceling implementation for calls follow conventional TWS design patterns. No proprietary patent technology, in-house design innovations, or advanced software integration are evident, positioning the product at industry standard technology levels without competitive differentiation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Since no measured performance data exists for the FALCON2, direct measured performance comparison is not possible, and evaluation proceeds based on functionality. The Moondrop Space Travel at 24.99 USD provides equivalent-or-better user-facing functionality, equipped with TWS functionality, passive noise reduction, and Bluetooth connectivity [1]. While the Space Travel has confirmed measured performance data showing well-tuned sound, good timbre, low distortion, and frequency response that closely follows preference curves, the FALCON2 lacks measurement data, making measured performance comparison impossible. Using the required cost-performance calculation: CP = 24.99 USD ÷ 165 USD = 0.15, rounded to 0.2. The FALCON2's significantly higher price cannot be justified by performance advantages over this budget alternative that provides equivalent-or-better functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Noble Audio provides standard support infrastructure but falls short with only 12-month warranty coverage for TWS products, significantly below the industry standard of 2 years for electronics [4]. The warranty is non-transferable, valid only for original purchasers from authorized sources, with standard mail-in repair process to their Texas facility. The company maintains an established presence in the IEM market since 2013, providing confidence in long-term support availability. However, warranty exclusions include loss, theft, damage from misuse, and accessories are typically not covered, representing standard but not exceptional support terms.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Noble Audio demonstrates rational scientific foundation through Dr. Moulton's audiological expertise and explicit rejection of subjective marketing claims, maintaining a "no bull" operational philosophy that avoids audio industry "snake oil" approaches [5]. The combination of rigorous scientific principles with practical hearing science knowledge represents sound design rationale. However, the company's traditional focus on exotic materials and artisanal craftsmanship may contribute costs unrelated to measured audio performance. The FALCON2 represents a conservative approach to TWS technology implementation without notable innovation or advanced functional integration such as DSP, AI, or sophisticated software features that could enhance user experience or performance.

## Advice

The Noble Audio FALCON2 is suitable for users who prioritize the Noble brand heritage and audiologist-informed design approach. However, potential purchasers should note that this product appears to be discontinued with limited new retail availability as of 2026, primarily found in secondary markets. Given the 2020 release date and rapid advancement in TWS technology, the FALCON2's specifications and feature set may feel dated compared to current offerings. The lack of measured performance data makes direct technical comparison with modern alternatives challenging. Users seeking contemporary TWS solutions should examine current-generation products with available measurement data. The 12-month warranty period is also below industry standards and should factor into purchasing decisions.
