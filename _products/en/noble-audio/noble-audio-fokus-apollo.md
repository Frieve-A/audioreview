summary: "Manufacturer-claimed world-first dynamic + planar hybrid wireless over-ear with 80h battery (ANC off), hybrid ANC (up to −35 dB claimed), LDAC/aptX HD, multipoint, and a detachable boom mic. Lacking independent lab measurements of FR/THD/ANC effectiveness, audible gains remain unverified. Against the Sony WH-1000XM6 at 449 USD with class-leading measured ANC, cost-performance is 0.7."

## Overview

FoKus Apollo is Noble’s first full-size wireless headphone, pairing a **40 mm dynamic** driver with a **14.5 mm planar magnetic** unit in a hybrid dual-driver array (claimed first of its kind). It supports **LDAC/aptX/aptX HD/AAC**, **Bluetooth 5.3** with multipoint, **hybrid ANC** using three microphones per side (up to **−35 dB** claimed), and delivers **up to 80 hours (ANC off) / 60 hours (ANC on)** of playtime. A detachable boom mic and extensive wired options (3.5 mm plus 4.4/6.3 mm adapters) are included. MSRP is **649 USD**.[1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, controlled measurements (e.g., FR, THD/IMD, verified ANC attenuation in dB) remain scarce. Consequently, numeric specs referenced here (−35 dB ANC claim; 80h/60h battery; codec and BT features) rely on the manufacturer and should be treated as **provisional** for audibility. We will incorporate credible third-party lab data as it becomes available.[1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

A dual-driver (dynamic + planar) wireless design, **three-mic-per-side hybrid ANC**, **LDAC/aptX HD**, **BT 5.3 with multipoint**, and **80h** battery indicate unusually advanced engineering for this class, including complex driver integration within a portable ANC platform.[1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (global)**: **Sony WH-1000XM6**, **449 USD** official US price. Multiple reputable measurements place XM6 at the top of ANC performance with >31 h battery (ANC on) and strong overall feature parity (LDAC, BT 5.3, multipoint).[3][4][5]

**Calculation**: **449 USD ÷ 649 USD = 0.69 → 0.7** (rounded to one decimal).  
Given XM6’s measured ANC leadership and mature platform at a significantly lower price, Apollo’s performance-per-dollar is fair rather than strong.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Noble states a **24-month** warranty for over-ear wireless headphones and provides an RMA process. Long-term failure-rate data is limited due to the product’s recency, but materials and replaceable pads are positives.[2][1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design direction—hybrid drivers, long battery life, robust ANC/telephony—addresses real user needs. However, until independent measurements demonstrate audible advantages versus simpler single-driver flagships, the premium pricing seems only **partly** justified on a transparency-of-sound basis.[1]

## Advice

If you value a unique hybrid driver topology, **very long battery life**, and bundled boom-mic versatility, Apollo fits well. If you prioritize **measured ANC effectiveness and value**, the **Sony WH-1000XM6 (449 USD)** remains the safer pick today. Measurement-focused buyers may wish to wait for comprehensive third-party lab data on Apollo.[3][4][5]
