## Overview

The GAOHOU XY-C50L is a compact Bluetooth 5.0 stereo amplifier board based on the Texas Instruments TPA3116D2 Class-D amplifier chip. Offering 50W x 2 channel output into 4Ω loads, this budget-oriented amplifier module targets DIY audio enthusiasts and basic stereo system builders. The board includes multiple input options including Bluetooth 5.0 wireless connectivity, 3.5mm auxiliary input, and USB input with app control capability. GAOHOU markets this as a versatile solution for custom audio projects, portable speakers, and entry-level home audio applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The XY-C50L demonstrates audio performance at problematic levels according to measurement criteria. Based on TI TPA3116D2 specifications and third-party measurements [1][2], key indicators show concerning results: THD+N measures exactly at the problematic boundary of 0.1%, while crosstalk performance is severely compromised at only -13 dB versus the -40 dB problematic threshold. Intermodulation distortion reaches approximately 0.5% (SMPTE method), significantly exceeding the 0.1% problematic level. The damping factor of 16-17x at low frequencies falls below the 20x problematic threshold. Frequency response exhibits 2-4 dB dips at 20Hz and 20kHz extremes. SINAD measurements exceed 64 dB at 5W, placing performance above problematic but below transparent levels. While the TPA3116D2 chip achieves over 90% efficiency, the acoustic performance measurements indicate multiple specifications operating at or beyond problematic thresholds for transparent audio reproduction.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The XY-C50L represents standard implementation of contemporary Class-D amplifier technology without significant technical differentiation. The design utilizes the established TI TPA3116D2 chip, offering appropriate features including AM interference suppression, programmable power limiting, and up to 1.2 MHz switching frequency [3]. The integration of Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity represents desirable contemporary wireless technology that the market demands. However, the implementation demonstrates no proprietary patent technology, significant technical expertise accumulation, or design ownership beyond standard chip application. The technology offers no competitive advantage duration, as similar implementations are easily replicated by competitors. The combination of digital signal processing with circuit integration is appropriate for the application, but the overall approach remains conservative without innovative technical advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At approximately 11 USD current market price, the XY-C50L represents the cheapest option among functionally equivalent Bluetooth stereo amplifiers with comparable specifications. Investigation of competing products reveals that alternatives such as the Fosi Audio BT10A TPA3116 Class-D amplifier with Bluetooth 5.0 and bass/treble adjustment costs approximately 50 USD, and the C50HS Bluetooth Amplifier Board TPA3116D2 with equivalent 50W+50W output, Bluetooth connectivity, multiple input modes, and app control support is priced higher than the review target. No cheaper alternatives were identified that provide equivalent user-facing functionality including Bluetooth 5.0 wireless connectivity, stereo amplification (50W+50W), multiple input options (Bluetooth, AUX, USB), and app control capability. As the XY-C50L is the world's cheapest product with equivalent functions and measured performance, the cost-performance score is set to 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The XY-C50L suffers from significant reliability and support infrastructure limitations. No specific warranty information, official customer service contacts, or dedicated support channels were identified for GAOHOU brand products [4]. The company appears to operate primarily through third-party marketplace sellers rather than direct manufacturer support. While the underlying TPA3116D2 chip design includes integrated protection circuits (overvoltage, undervoltage, overtemperature, DC-detect, and short-circuit protection) that provide inherent reliability advantages, the lack of manufacturer support infrastructure presents substantial concerns for long-term ownership. No official repair services, firmware update support, or established track record of reliability was found. Users must rely on general electronics knowledge and third-party repair services for any issues beyond the warranty period provided by individual sellers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The XY-C50L demonstrates rational design philosophy through its focus on measurement-based performance using the established TPA3116D2 platform [5]. The approach prioritizes cost-effectiveness by concentrating expenses on core amplification functionality rather than unnecessary premium materials or exotic circuit topologies. The integration of efficient Class-D amplification with Bluetooth 5.0 wireless technology represents logical technological progression for contemporary audio applications. The design avoids non-scientific claims and maintains appropriate functional integration suited to its intended DIY and basic audio system purposes. However, the conservative approach using proven technology without innovation limits the design philosophy evaluation. The cost optimization successfully minimizes unnecessary expenses while delivering the essential amplification and connectivity functions required by the target market.

## Advice

The GAOHOU XY-C50L suits budget-conscious DIY enthusiasts requiring basic Bluetooth amplification functionality who can accept audio performance at problematic levels. The 11 USD price point offers competitive value for simple projects like desktop speakers or basic stereo systems where ultimate audio quality is not the primary concern. However, serious audio applications should consider alternatives with superior measured performance, particularly regarding crosstalk and distortion characteristics. The lack of manufacturer support infrastructure makes this product appropriate only for users comfortable with self-service repairs and troubleshooting. For critical applications or users requiring reliable technical support, investing in products from established audio manufacturers with proven support networks is recommended despite higher initial costs.
