## Overview

The Gustard DAC-X30 is a high-performance network streaming DAC featuring four ESS Technology flagship DAC chips ES9039SPRO. It adopts a fully balanced configuration using two chips per channel, achieving optimal performance through independent power supply and grounding. Supporting PCM 32bit/768kHz, DSD512, and MQA, it integrates network streaming functions including Roon, Airplay, DLNA, and UPnP. The product incorporates technologies expected in high-end audio equipment, including FPGA processing, OCXO crystal oscillator, and preamp stage with R2R volume control.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Measurement performance demonstrates excellent results reaching transparent levels. THD+N ≤0.0001% significantly exceeds the transparent standard of below 0.01%, while S/N ratio of 129dB meets the ideal value of 105dB or higher. Frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz ±0.2dB achieves the transparent level of ±0.5dB or better, and channel crosstalk of -139dB far exceeds the standard of -70dB or lower. Dynamic range of 130dB also clears the ideal value of 105dB or higher, with nearly all items in the measurement criteria table reaching transparent levels. The fully balanced configuration with four ES9039SPRO chips and independent power design effectively eliminates distortion and noise in the audible range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design using four industry-leading ES9039SPRO chips is technically advanced. Technologies directly contributing to measurement performance improvement are implemented, including fully balanced configuration using two DAC chips per channel, independent power supply and ground design, advanced digital signal processing via FPGA, and low-jitter design with OCXO crystal oscillator. The combination of ES9311Q linear regulator and XMOS XU216 USB interface is also rational. The autonomous DSP SHARC digital filter using 64-bit floating-point algorithms and noise shaping technology demonstrates high technical level. However, these technologies are also adopted in existing high-performance DACs, limiting originality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against the 3000 USD price, the EverSolo DMP-A6 with equivalent measurement performance and network streaming functions is available for 859 USD. The DMP-A6 uses two ES9038Q2M DAC chips and provides transparent level performance equivalent to the X30 in major measurement items including THD+N, S/N ratio, and frequency response. Network streaming functions (Roon Ready, DLNA, Airplay, UPnP support) are also integrated, providing equivalent functionality for users. Cost-performance calculation shows 859 USD ÷ 3000 USD = 0.286, indicating equivalent performance and functionality can be obtained for approximately 29% of the X30's price. While there are added values such as four-chip configuration and premium chassis, the reality is limited superiority in performance-to-price ratio. WiiM Ultra (329 USD) also achieves equivalent functions and transparent levels, and the score was determined considering the average of multiple alternatives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Gustard is an established brand as a Chinese audio manufacturer, with quality control and technical support meeting industry average standards. The company's DAC products report stable operation across multiple review sites, with no critical defect reports found. Products include standard warranty with support structure established through distributors. Firmware updates are supported, enabling expected maintenance for products with network functions. However, compared to established Western brands, there are inferior aspects in long-term reliability track record and support system comprehensiveness.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A rational design philosophy pursuing transparent level measurement performance is consistently maintained. Investment is made in technologies that can scientifically expect sound quality improvement effects, including fully balanced configuration with four DAC chips, independent power supply, and low-jitter design. Integration of network streaming functions is also a forward-looking approach corresponding to modern audio environments. Performance pursuit based on measurement results is scientific, with non-rational occult elements eliminated. However, given the current situation where equivalent measurement performance can be achieved with more affordable products, questions arise regarding the necessity of existing as expensive dedicated equipment. Similar functions and performance can be achieved with general-purpose PC+DAC configurations (e.g., Topping E70 + PC streaming), limiting advantages as dedicated equipment.

## Advice

The Gustard DAC-X30 is a high-quality network streaming DAC that is technically excellent with measurement performance reaching transparent levels. Compared to the EverSolo DMP-A6 (859 USD) with equivalent functions and performance, approximately 71% price difference provides four ES9039SPRO chip configuration and premium chassis. Whether this price difference matches the technical superiority and chassis quality of the four-chip configuration becomes the purchasing decision point. For those prioritizing network streaming functions and seeking highest level measurement performance, the X30 is a reasonable choice. Conversely, for cost-conscious buyers, the DMP-A6 or WiiM Ultra with similar functions is rational. General-purpose PC+DAC configurations can also achieve equivalent performance at lower cost. Since both products provide transparent level sound quality, we recommend considering the balance between price difference and added value.
