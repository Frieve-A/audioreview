## Overview

The Gustard AH90 (branded as Audalytic) is a compact network streaming DAC and headphone amplifier featuring AKM's flagship AK4499EX DAC chip with AK4191 modulator. At 599 USD, it combines high-resolution digital decoding up to 768kHz/DSD512, network streaming capabilities with Roon Bridge support, and a 1W balanced headphone amplifier in a single desktop unit. The device represents Gustard's entry into the integrated streaming market with mainstream flagship DAC architecture.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Measurement data for AH90 has not been published by major third parties as of the review date. Assessment therefore starts at the unknown-measurement baseline. Manufacturer-claimed figures include SNR around 129 dB (A-weighted, line out) and support for PCM up to 32-bit/768 kHz, native DSD512, and MQA via USB/LAN. Retail technical sheets specify frequency response of 20 Hz–20 kHz within ±0.5 dB and standard output levels of 2 Vrms (RCA) / 4 Vrms (XLR) [1][2]. Until independent labs publish concrete results for THD+N/SINAD, crosstalk, jitter, and linearity, scientific validity remains provisional at 0.5 based on catalog specifications only.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The AH90 employs current-generation flagship components including AKM's premier AK4499EX DAC chip and third-generation XMOS XU316 USB interface. Design incorporates proven clock management with CK01 module and established analog output stage using OPA1612 operational amplifiers. Network streaming implementation supports modern protocols including Roon Bridge, UPnP, and HQPlayer NAA. While technically competent using industry-leading components, the overall design represents standard implementation rather than breakthrough engineering approaches.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Price (AH90): 599 USD. Comparator: FiiO R7 at 699 USD with verified ~109 dB SINAD on line out at ASR [3] and equivalent-or-greater functionality (full network streaming, balanced/XLR line out, powerful balanced headphone stage). No cheaper product with equal-or-better functionality and verified measurements was found.


## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Gustard provides standard manufacturer warranty coverage with established repair network in major markets. Firmware update capability allows for streaming protocol improvements and bug fixes. The company has built reputation for consistent product quality in the desktop DAC segment over recent years. No significant reliability concerns noted in user feedback, though long-term reliability data limited due to recent product introduction.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The AH90 addresses rational market needs by combining streaming, DAC, and headphone amplification in single chassis, eliminating requirements for multiple components and reducing system complexity. Network streaming integration aligns with modern music consumption patterns while maintaining high-resolution capability. Use of flagship DAC architecture demonstrates commitment to measured performance over marketing claims. Design prioritizes functionality and value delivery rather than luxury positioning or esoteric approaches.

## Advice

The AH90 suits users seeking comprehensive desktop audio solution with network streaming capability at minimal cost. The combination of flagship DAC implementation, adequate headphone amplification, and streaming functionality provides excellent value for modern digital music listeners. Consider alternatives only if specific features like touchscreen interface or higher power amplification are required. The device represents optimal choice for users prioritizing functionality and performance over premium construction or brand prestige.
