## Overview

The Neumann KH 80 DSP A G is a 4-inch 2-way active nearfield monitor manufactured by Neumann, the renowned microphone manufacturer. It features bi-amp driving with 120W and 70W Class D amplifiers, plus precise acoustic correction functions through DSP control. With a frequency response of 57Hz-21kHz (±3dB) and maximum output of 108.8dB SPL, it delivers professional studio monitoring despite its compact size. Network connectivity enables app-based control with an 8-band parametric EQ for room acoustic correction.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement results are excellent for a 4-inch monitor. Against the nominal frequency response of 57Hz-21kHz (±3dB), Neumann's official measurement data shows actual values achieving flatness within ±0.6dB across the entire range. Unit-to-unit variation is extremely good at within 0.25dB, a result of DSP factory calibration. A maximum SPL of 108.8dB is high-level for this size, and self-noise is good at below 20 dBA at a 10cm distance. THD is excellent at below 0.1% at normal listening levels. However, the 57Hz low-end limitation is a constraint arising from its physical size, limiting its ability to achieve full-range transparent reproduction on its own.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The DSP-controlled bi-amp drive system is technically advanced. Advanced technologies are employed, including an FIR filter for a linear-phase crossover, an 8-band parametric EQ for acoustic correction, and network-based remote control functionality. The Mathematically Modeled Dispersion (MMD) waveguide contributes to directivity optimization, and factory individual DSP calibration significantly reduces unit-to-unit characteristic variation. These technologies definitively contribute to measurement performance improvement, and the technical standard in this category can be evaluated as very high.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Against this product's market price of 549 USD, the IK Multimedia iLoud MTM, which offers equivalent or superior functionality, is available for 399 USD. The iLoud MTM features a built-in DSP for automatic room correction, similar to the KH 80 DSP, and boasts a superior frequency response of 40Hz-24kHz (±3dB). The cost-performance is evaluated based on the calculation: 399 USD ÷ 549 USD = 0.726. The existence of an alternative that provides the core DSP correction functionality at a lower price prevents a higher score.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Neumann, a German acoustic equipment manufacturer founded in 1928, boasts high reliability in the industry. The product construction is robust with quality suitable for professional audio use. The network-based DSP control system increases complexity but also provides the potential for future firmware updates and feature expansion. International sales networks and technical support systems are well-established, providing industry-standard warranty services. However, due to the complexity of the DSP system, the failure risk may be slightly higher compared to conventional passive speakers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design philosophy, aimed at improving measurable acoustic performance, is extremely rational. DSP correction of unit-to-unit variation, room acoustic adaptation functionality, and the realization of linear-phase characteristics via FIR filters are all scientifically-based approaches to sound quality improvement. The network control system is modern and highly practical, enabling unified management of multiple units. The MMD waveguide's directivity optimization also provides improvement effects confirmable through measurement results. This design philosophy, which eliminates occult elements and focuses purely on improving measurement performance, is the most rational approach toward the goal of transparent acoustic reproduction.

## Advice

The KH 80 DSP A G is a nearfield monitor for professionals who prioritize high-precision acoustic characteristics through DSP control. The high consistency between products via factory calibration and the correction functionality for room acoustics provide significant value for applications requiring accurate monitoring. However, a strong competitor exists in the IK Multimedia iLoud MTM (399 USD), which offers better low-frequency extension and equivalent DSP room correction at a lower price. The purchasing decision hinges on whether one finds the Neumann brand reliability and unique acoustic designs like the MMD waveguide to be worth the price difference of approximately 150 USD.
