## Overview

The Neumann KH 750 DSP D G is a professional DSP subwoofer developed by Neumann, a prestigious German audio equipment manufacturer. Designed to integrate with the company's KH series studio monitors, it features a 10-inch driver with 18Hz-300Hz reproduction capability and a 256W amplifier. The sealed cabinet design achieves a fast transient response, and it provides high-precision automatic room correction and bass management functions via an iPad app or the dedicated "MA 1" measurement microphone. It is positioned as a product that inherits the traditional quality and reliability of the Neumann brand.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Objective evaluation based on measurement data shows excellent performance. Its specifications, including a frequency response of 18Hz-300Hz (±3dB) and a maximum SPL of 105dB, are close to the transparent level in the policy reference table. The THD is below 0.5% at 95dB SPL, and the analog dynamic range of 119dB(A) is an excellent value exceeding the transparent level (105dB+). The self-generated noise is extremely low at below 20dB(A) SPL, achieving ideal performance from an S/N ratio perspective. The improvement in group delay characteristics due to the sealed design also contributes to scientifically effective sound quality enhancement. The DSP-based FIR phase correction (170Hz-16kHz, within ±45°) also provides measurable sound quality improvement effects.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 10-inch ultra-long excursion driver employing ELFF (Extremely Linear Force Factor) technology demonstrates technical advancement through Neumann's proprietary design. Technical specifications including an efficient design combined with a 256W Class D amplifier, 192kHz/24bit digital input support, and a 4th-order DSP crossover exceed industry standards. Remote control via an iPad app and integration with the MA 1 automatic monitor alignment system represent an advanced technical implementation suited to contemporary studio environments. However, automatic room correction technology itself is also adopted by other companies, so it is not a revolutionary unique feature.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The core feature of this product is its DSP-based automatic room correction, so the evaluation must be compared with products offering equivalent functionality. The system price, including the necessary Neumann MA 1 measurement microphone (approx. 40,000 JPY), is around 280,000 JPY. A comparable product is the Genelec 7350A SAM™ Subwoofer with its GLM Kit (totaling approx. 200,000 JPY), which offers similar automatic room correction.
Calculation: 200,000 JPY ÷ 280,000 JPY = 0.71, resulting in a score of 0.7.
Inexpensive subwoofers without DSP offer entirely different value and are not valid for comparison. While this product is not the cheapest among those with similar functions, the price difference has a certain rationale when considering its unique, integrated ecosystem.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Neumann, as an established audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1928, possesses industry-leading reliability and support systems. The company's products have a proven track record of long-term use in broadcast stations and recording studios, and their low failure rates are well-regarded in the industry. In major markets, after-sales service systems are established through authorized distributors, with warranty periods and repair support exceeding industry standards. The product's durability design and quality control processes meet standards for long-term professional use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The high-precision automatic room correction and bass management functions via DSP are a scientifically effective approach to solving room acoustic problems. Rational design policies, such as minimizing group delay with a sealed cabinet and improving phase characteristics with FIR phase correction, contribute to achieving the transparent levels in the measurement results reference table. The integration with the MA 1 system is highly rational as it allows users to build an optimal monitoring environment without expert knowledge. As a dedicated device, it offers advanced integration and convenience that are difficult to achieve with a combination of general-purpose products, and its stance on pursuing unique value commensurate with its price is commendable.

## Advice

The KH 750 DSP D G is a technically excellent subwoofer that truly shines, especially for users of Neumann's KH series monitors. The seamless automatic room correction via the MA 1 system is a significant advantage not easily obtained with other combinations.
If cost-performance is a priority, competitors like Genelec's SAM series exist, which can achieve similar automatic room correction functions at a lower price. However, if you value the perfect integration within the Neumann ecosystem and the resulting workflow improvements, the price difference can be justified. Before purchasing, it is recommended to carefully consider which ecosystem is better suited for your production environment and future scalability.
