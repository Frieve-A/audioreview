## Overview

The Neumann MA1 is a DSP-based automatic monitor correction system announced in 2020 by Neumann in collaboration with Fraunhofer IIS. The v2.0 update released in November 2023 integrated multi-channel expansion capabilities, supporting surround and immersive audio applications. It operates in combination with Neumann KH series monitors such as KH 80 DSP, KH 120, KH 310, KH 420, or KH 750 DSP subwoofers. The system combines an individually calibrated measurement microphone with algorithmic software to achieve hardware-level frequency and phase characteristic correction. Developed with advanced calibration algorithms from Fraunhofer IIS, one of the world's leading acoustic signal processing research institutions, it optimizes not only amplitude response but also phase response, providing the highest standard of tonal accuracy and impulse reproduction.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The MA1 uses an individually calibrated measurement microphone operating in the 20Hz-20kHz frequency range. The microphone sensitivity is 30mV/Pa -30dBV at 1kHz, with post-calibration accuracy of Â±0.5dB, achieving high measurement precision that complies with the transparent level of the measurement results reference table. The algorithm co-developed with Fraunhofer IIS provides advantages over competing software-based correction systems by correcting not only amplitude response but also phase response. DSP hardware-level correction eliminates the need for plugin processing within DAWs, achieving transparent correction with eliminated latency. The v2.0 update released in November 2023 enables optimization for surround and immersive audio setups through multi-channel expansion functionality, with phase linearization of crossover filters significantly improving impulse reproduction. The measurement process is automated, enabling objective correction that eliminates subjective user judgment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The MA1's technical advantage lies in its advanced algorithms co-developed with Fraunhofer IIS. Fraunhofer IIS is known as one of the world's highest-standard acoustic signal processing research institutions, famous for developing the MP3 compression algorithm. The MA1 adopts an innovative approach that processes and stores correction data directly within DSP hardware, unlike conventional software-based correction systems. The phase correction functionality is particularly technically advanced, with MA1 simultaneously optimizing phase response while competing systems like Sonarworks and IK Multimedia ARC focus primarily on amplitude correction. The individually calibrated measurement microphone guarantees complete accuracy in the audible range through comparative calibration with ANSI-certified measurement microphones. This technical approach is innovative within the industry and continues to be evaluated as attractive technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The MA1 is priced at 249USD. The most affordable alternative product providing equivalent functionality is Sonarworks SoundID Reference for Speakers & Headphones (249USD). SoundID Reference supports both headphones and speakers, with over 500 headphone profiles and speaker setups from stereo to 9.1.6 Atmos rooms. Since both products are priced identically at 249USD, the MA1 represents the most affordable option for its specific hardware-level correction capabilities with Neumann KH series monitors. While SoundID Reference offers broader compatibility across different monitor brands, MA1 provides unique advantages in phase correction and hardware-level processing that justify equivalent pricing for users already invested in the Neumann ecosystem.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Neumann, established in 1928, is a German heritage audio equipment manufacturer with worldwide high reliability. The company provides 24-month international warranty on all products and offers warranty services through certified service centers worldwide. Particularly noteworthy is the long-term support system that repairs all post-war manufactured microphones, speakers, and headphones with genuine parts wherever possible. MA1 manufacturing is conducted in ultra-clean room environments comparable to semiconductor manufacturing or pharmaceutical companies, meeting international highest standards. Quality control implements over 50 types of tests on microphone capsules alone, with all diaphragms undergoing detailed measurement procedures. This thorough quality control system ensures MA1 maintains stable performance over extended periods. It provides reliable support systems that inherit the traditional quality standards of German manufacturing.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The MA1's design philosophy demonstrates strong rational foundations with some practical limitations. The rational aspects include achieving transparent correction with eliminated processing delays through DSP hardware-level correction processing, eliminating DAW plugin processing delays. The phase correction functionality co-developed with Fraunhofer IIS provides scientific advantages not found in competing systems. The hardware-level approach ensures consistent, low-latency correction that software-based systems cannot match. However, the system's limitation to Neumann DSP-equipped monitors creates a closed ecosystem that restricts versatility. While this dedicated approach enables deeper integration and more precise correction, it narrows user choices in modern audio production environments where compatibility with diverse monitor brands is valuable. The design philosophy is largely rational from a technical standpoint, prioritizing correction accuracy and system integration over universal compatibility.

## Advice

When considering purchasing the Neumann MA1, it is important to first verify your monitor environment. MA1 requires combination with Neumann KH series monitors such as KH 80 DSP, KH 120, KH 310, KH 420, or KH 750 DSP subwoofers, necessitating additional investment if these products are not owned. For those already using Neumann KH series monitors, MA1's phase correction functionality and v2.0 multi-channel expansion capabilities provide clear advantages not obtainable from other correction systems. Particularly for professional applications where accurate tonal reproduction and impulse response are important, there is investment value.

Conversely, for those seeking universal room correction systems, we strongly recommend considering alternative products such as Sonarworks SoundID Reference (249USD) or IK Multimedia ARC System 3 (300USD, microphone included). These systems can be used with any monitor, with SoundID Reference offering equivalent correction effects at the same price point but with broader compatibility.

For those with limited budgets or planning future changes to different brand monitors, investment in MA1 is not recommended. MA1's true value is realized only when used long-term in combination with Neumann KH series monitors and when multi-channel environment work is required. Before purchasing, careful consideration of current monitor environment and future expansion plans is important.
