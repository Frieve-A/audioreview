## Overview

The Neumann KH-120 II is a DSP-equipped active nearfield monitor speaker developed by Neumann, the venerable German audio manufacturer. It features a 5.25-inch woofer and 1-inch tweeter in a bi-amplified configuration with a total output of 245W (145W woofer, 100W tweeter). With a frequency response of 44Hz-21kHz (±3dB) and maximum SPL capability of 116.8dB, it incorporates a DSP-controlled high-precision crossover and Mathematically Modelled Dispersion (MMD) waveguide technology. Designed for professional studio use, it also offers optional room correction functionality using the MA 1 measurement microphone system.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The frequency response of 44Hz-21kHz (±3dB) is positioned at the boundary of the problematic level according to measurement result standards for the audible range. The transparent level requires a deviation within ±0.5dB, making this ±3dB specification a threshold where auditory effects begin to emerge. The maximum SPL of 116.8dB shows excellent performance for a 5-inch class nearfield monitor. The published THD+N specification is for maximum output (with limiter disabled), and the distortion rate at normal usage levels is significantly lower than this value. Detailed data for S/N ratio and crosstalk are not published, making it difficult to confirm transparent level achievement. The linear phase realization of 120Hz-16kHz (±45°) through DSP phase control is commendable, but overall measurement performance remains at the industry standard level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The DSP-controlled digital crossover and Mathematically Modelled Dispersion (MMD) waveguide technology represent modern and rational design approaches. They avoid phase distortion from analog filters and achieve precise acoustic control. The bi-amplified configuration with 145W/100W output distribution is also an appropriate design. However, the technologies employed are already established in the industry, and innovative elements uniquely developed by Neumann are limited. The DSP engine's room correction functionality can be evaluated as added value, but this is also a widely adopted technology in other manufacturers' products. While technical efforts contributing to measurement performance improvement are recognized, they do not reach industry-leading standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

For this evaluation, we compare the total system cost, including the implementation of the room correction feature. To perform room correction with this product, the MA 1 measurement system (approx. 41,580 JPY) is required in addition to the main unit (148,500 JPY). The system cost per speaker is approximately 169,290 JPY. In contrast, the competing Adam Audio A7V (91,300 JPY) can be integrated with Sonarworks' measurement system (approx. 61,160 JPY incl. mic), resulting in a system cost per speaker of about 121,880 JPY. The calculation is 121,880 JPY ÷ 169,290 JPY = 0.719..., which rounds to a score of 0.7. Even when considering room correction, competing products still have a cost advantage.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Neumann, founded in 1928, is a venerable German audio manufacturer that has built high reliability in the industry. A support system is established through authorized distributors, providing a 2-year standard warranty. As a professional equipment manufacturer, it has an abundant track record with adoption in many recording studios. Product failure rates are maintained below the industry average, and reliability for long-term use is highly rated. Firmware updates are also appropriately handled, providing necessary support as a DSP-equipped product. However, some professional features (e.g., automatic calibration via the MA 1) are sold as separate options, requiring additional investment for a complete system implementation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The adoption of DSP-controlled digital signal processing and an active crossover is an extremely rational approach in modern acoustic technology. The direction to avoid the phase distortion of analog filters and achieve more precise acoustic control is a scientifically sound judgment. The directivity control through MMD waveguide technology is also an appropriate acoustic design for nearfield monitors. The design, which achieves high output while maintaining low power consumption (17W idle, 0.3W standby), is also efficient. The incorporation of room correction functionality to mitigate the acoustic effects of the installation environment is also commendable. However, these technologies have already become industry standard, and innovative approaches toward achieving transparent-level sound quality are not observed. Further improvement in measurement performance remains a future challenge.

## Advice

While the KH-120 II is a technically solid product, it's difficult to find a clear advantage that justifies its price. Especially when considering the total cost to build a room correction system, competing products like the Adam Audio A7V can achieve similar functionality at a lower cost. For users who prioritize pure cost-performance, we strongly recommend considering other options, including the A7V. However, it can be a viable option for those who value the reliability of the Neumann brand or the seamless integration of a native room correction system with the MA 1. When making a purchase, be sure to fully compare these cost differences and functionalities.
