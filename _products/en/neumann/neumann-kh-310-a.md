## Overview

The Neumann KH-310-A is a 3-way tri-amplified active studio monitor developed by Neumann, the established German audio equipment manufacturer. It features an 8.25-inch woofer, a 3-inch midrange driver, and a 1-inch tweeter, powered by independent thermally protected Class AB amplifiers with a total rated output of 290W (150W for bass, 70W for mids, and 70W for treble). It achieves a frequency response of 34Hz-21kHz and a maximum SPL exceeding 116dB, designed for precision monitoring applications in professional studios. The sealed cabinet design prevents standing wave resonance, and the MMD (Mathematically Modeled Dispersion) waveguide technology realizes excellent directivity control.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measurement data demonstrates exceptionally excellent performance. The frequency response covers a wide range from 34Hz to 21kHz, achieving an extremely flat response within ±1.5dB in the primary listening band. Harmonic distortion is very low, remaining below 0.5% above 85Hz even at a high output of 95dB, meeting the transparent level in our policy's reference table. The maximum SPL reaches 116dB between 100Hz-6kHz, allowing for accurate reproduction of sources with large dynamics. Sound on Sound magazine's measurement review evaluated it as having "exceptional sound quality and performance" and "outstanding resolution, neutrality, and precision," clearly demonstrating scientifically audible improvement effects.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Advanced proprietary design technology has been invested. The MMD (Mathematically Modeled Dispersion) waveguide technology is an innovative approach that optimizes horizontal directivity through elliptical wavefront control, improving sound imaging accuracy. The 3-way tri-amplified configuration places independent amplifiers optimized for each driver, employing thermally protected Class AB amplifiers of 150W for the woofer, 70W for the midrange, and 70W for the tweeter (210W, 90W, and 90W peak, respectively). The sealed cabinet design provides excellent transient response, contributing to tight and accurate bass reproduction. These technologies exceed industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The current market price is approximately 2,500 USD per unit. As a point of comparison, Neumann's newer model, the KH 150 (approx. 1,750 USD), exists. In terms of raw performance, this unit has superior low-frequency extension (34Hz vs. 39Hz) compared to the KH 150. However, the KH 150, with its modern DSP control, exhibits distortion performance in the mid-to-high frequencies that can even surpass this unit. The most critical difference is the KH 150's automatic room correction capability. This feature makes it highly likely to achieve a flatter final acoustic response in many real-world environments. While this unit offers deeper bass, the KH 150 provides superior room correction and extremely low mid-high frequency distortion at a lower price. Considering this value trade-off, we rate the score at 0.7, based on the calculation "1,750 USD ÷ 2,500 USD = 0.7".

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Neumann is an established German audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1928, with a reputation for reliability for long-term use in professional studios worldwide. Each amplifier features independent thermal protection limiters that protect the woofer, midrange, and tweeter voice coils from overheating. The sealed cabinet is structurally robust, designed to withstand long-term use in professional applications. International support systems are established, with replacement parts supply and maintenance services available. Sound on Sound magazine evaluated it as "setting an exceptionally high standard as a compact 3-way reference monitor," confirming its track record in professional applications.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

It adopts an extremely scientific approach that prioritizes fidelity to the source. The MMD waveguide technology eliminates subjective "sound coloration" through mathematically modeled wavefront control, achieving accurate sound reproduction. The sealed cabinet design is a rational choice that prevents standing wave resonance and enables transparent low-frequency reproduction. The 3-way tri-amplified configuration places amplifiers optimized for each frequency band, minimizing mutual interference. The design philosophy, which invests technology in performance improvements that meet transparent levels in measurement criteria, such as frequency response flatness and low distortion, and pursues purely measurable sound quality improvements, is highly rational.

## Advice

For professionals who value deep low-frequency extension without a subwoofer and a pure analog signal path, this unit remains a top-tier choice. The midrange resolution, characteristic of a 3-way design, is also a significant attraction. On the other hand, for those seeking a state-of-the-art monitoring environment at a more affordable price, the KH 150 is an extremely strong contender. While the KH 150's bass extension concedes a step to this unit, its DSP-powered automatic room correction holds the potential to create a flatter listening environment than this unit alone in many studio settings. The choice depends on whether one prioritizes absolute low-frequency capability or the environmental adaptability offered by DSP—a difference in design philosophy.
