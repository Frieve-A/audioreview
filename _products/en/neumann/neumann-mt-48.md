## Overview

The Neumann MT-48 represents the renowned microphone manufacturer's first entry into the audio interface market, developed in partnership with Merging Technologies. This desktop 12-in/16-out USB-C interface features reference-class AD/DA conversion (AD dynamic range 136 dB), comprehensive DSP processing, and professional features including a touchscreen mixer and AES67 network audio. The platform is closely aligned with Merging’s converter technology and aims to deliver transparent performance consistent with Neumann’s microphones and monitors. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate performance that meets or exceeds transparent thresholds in key areas. Notable figures include: mic preamp + ADC THD+N < −110 dB (0.0003%), line inputs THD+N < −105 dB (0.0006%), instrument inputs THD+N < −112 dB (0.0003%), and headphone output dynamic range up to 122 dB-A (high-gain mode). AD converter dynamic range is specified at 136 dB-A. These values clear the 0.01% distortion and ~105 dB dynamic-range transparency targets used in our criteria. Independent third-party lab measurements remain limited, so this assessment is provisional pending broader verification. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The MT-48 brings several advanced capabilities to a compact desktop form factor: an intuitive touchscreen UI with four independent monitor mixes and talkback, on-board DSP (parametric EQ, dynamics, reverb), and Dual Output Technology that routes simultaneous pre-FX and post-FX signals to the driver for wet/dry recording and backup capture. Network audio is supported via RAVENNA/AES67, and from Q4 2024 the unit ships Dante Ready™; Dante operation requires installing Neumann’s Dante firmware (free) and purchasing an 8×8 or 64×64 channel license from Audinate. These features position the MT-48 as a technologically forward option for hybrid studio and AoIP workflows. [1][2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Market price for the MT-48 is **1,850 USD** (street). [3] For **USB-centric workflows (excluding AoIP)**, the **RME Babyface Pro FS** delivers equivalent core user functionality (2 mic pres, ADAT expansion to 12×12 I/O, comprehensive DSP mixing via TotalMix FX, mature drivers) at **999 USD**, with line-input SNR improvements to 116.3 dB (120 dBA) in the latest revision. [4][5] 

Accordingly, **CP = 999 USD ÷ 1,850 USD = 0.54 → 0.5**.  
Note: for integrated **AoIP** (AES67/Dante) with comparable quality and touchscreen workflow, the closest peer is **Merging Anubis Pro SPS** at **2,295 USD**, i.e., **more expensive** than MT-48; there is no cheaper like-for-like AoIP/touchscreen alternative with similar analog I/O. [6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This is Neumann’s first interface, but it benefits from the company’s professional support infrastructure and Merging’s proven platform. Neumann has continued active development: units shipping from Q4 2024 are Dante Ready™, and **registrations through 31 September 2025** qualify for a **free permanent license** for the Monitor Mission (enhanced monitor-control features). Long-term field data is still limited compared with incumbents such as RME, but early firmware and ecosystem updates suggest healthy product support. [1][2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design prioritizes measurable fidelity and workflow: high-headroom conversion, per-channel DSP, multi-cue monitoring, and network audio integration align with rational studio engineering needs. Pricing leans into brand and ecosystem value rather than purely spec-per-dollar considerations, which is a modest deviation from a strictly utilitarian positioning.

## Advice

The MT-48 is compelling for studios that value: (1) a **touchscreen mixer** with **wet/dry Dual Output** capture, (2) **AES67/Dante** integration, and (3) tight alignment with Neumann monitors/headphones. If you **don’t require AoIP**, the **RME Babyface Pro FS (999 USD)** offers similar core recording/mixing functionality and excellent drivers at a much lower price. For larger USB-based I/O on a budget, the **Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 (4th Gen)** provides 26×26 I/O with two independent headphone outs and modern safety features (Auto Gain, Clip Safe) at **749.99 USD**, though without AoIP or a touchscreen.
