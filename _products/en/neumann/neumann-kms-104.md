## Overview

The Neumann KMS-104 is a studio-grade handheld condenser microphone designed specifically for stage use. Building on Neumann's decades of studio microphone expertise, the KMS-104 combines the precision of a condenser capsule with the ruggedness required for live performance. The microphone features a cardioid pickup pattern, built-in pop protection, and a hardened steel grille, delivering Neumann's signature sound quality in a format suitable for demanding stage environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The KMS-104 demonstrates good performance against measurement criteria. Maximum SPL of 150 dB (0.5% THD) significantly exceeds the excellent level of 140 dB, providing exceptional capability for high sound pressure environments [1]. The S/N ratio of 76 dB approaches the transparent level of 80 dB for microphones, showing competent noise performance [1]. The equivalent noise level of 18 dB-A falls between the transparent level (10 dB-A or below) and problematic level (20 dB-A or above), representing intermediate performance [1]. Dynamic range of 132 dB exceeds the transparent level of 105 dB, demonstrating excellent performance [1]. The frequency response of 20 Hz - 20 kHz covers the full audible range [1]. The combination of excellent SPL capability and dynamic range with intermediate noise performance places the scientific validity above average.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The KMS-104 demonstrates significant technical sophistication through Neumann's proprietary technologies. The microphone incorporates specialized capsule design, frequency response trimming elements, and directional characteristic optimization [1]. The transformerless output stage represents in-house circuit topology that prevents RF and electromagnetic interference [1]. Hand assembly with over 100 quality control checkpoints and up to 50 different tests per capsule demonstrates manufacturing expertise [3]. Custom simulation software for acoustic optimization shows advanced engineering capabilities [3]. The precision condenser capsule technology and low 50-ohm output impedance enabling 300-meter cable runs without transmission losses represent meaningful technical achievements that competitors would find difficult to replicate quickly.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

CP = 304 USD รท 350 USD = 0.87

The Shure KSM9 at 304 USD provides equivalent-or-better functionality with handheld stage design, superior S/N ratio (80 dB vs 76 dB), comparable maximum SPL (139-149 dB vs 150 dB), and dual polar patterns (cardioid/supercardioid) [4]. Equipped with similar handheld form factor, stage durability requirements, and equivalent measured performance across key specifications, the KSM9 delivers functionally equivalent capabilities with additional pattern switching flexibility [4]. The KMS-104's current market price of 350 USD offers reasonable value compared to the cheapest equivalent handheld stage condenser, though the KSM9 remains available at lower cost with superior specifications.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Neumann provides standard 24-month warranty coverage with global manufacturer support infrastructure [5]. The hand assembly process with extensive quality control demonstrates robust construction methodology [5]. Service availability for all Neumann microphones manufactured since 1947 with archived production drawings shows exceptional long-term support commitment [5]. The hardened steel grille and thick-walled housing provide mechanical durability for stage use [1]. The transformerless circuit design provides good RF immunity for stage environments [1]. Professional repair services and the ability to remanufacture mechanical parts according to original specifications provide comprehensive support coverage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Neumann's approach emphasizes measurement-focused development with the goal of eliminating rather than merely reducing distortion, noise, and artifacts [6]. Custom simulation and calculation software for acoustic optimization demonstrates scientific methodology [6]. The precision manufacturing approach with hand assembly where automation proves insufficient shows practical engineering decisions [6]. Fixed low-cut filter compensation for proximity effect addresses specific stage use requirements rationally [1]. The focus on achieving transparent level specifications in maximum SPL and dynamic range shows rational performance optimization. The transformerless design addresses practical RF immunity concerns for stage environments [1]. While the conservative analog-only approach foregoes digital integration, the design philosophy demonstrates strong scientific rationality in pursuing measurable performance improvements for stage applications.

## Advice

The KMS-104 suits professional vocalists and sound engineers who require a handheld stage condenser with Neumann's established sound character and build quality. The excellent maximum SPL capability and dynamic range make it appropriate for high-energy performances and loud stage environments. The good cost-performance compared to equivalent handheld stage condensers makes it a reasonable choice in this specialized category. The Shure KSM9 offers superior noise specifications and dual polar patterns but costs 499 USD versus 350 USD for the KMS-104. Consider the KMS-104 when you need proven handheld stage condenser performance with good value compared to direct competitors, excellent long-term support, and Neumann's measurement-focused design approach for professional stage applications.
