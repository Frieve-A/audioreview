rating: [3.1, 0.8, 0.7, 0.1, 0.9, 0.6]
price: 3595
summary: "Industry-standard multi-pattern condenser with strong measured performance and mature engineering; outstanding service longevity. Design philosophy is scientific but conservative, and value is sharply limited by much cheaper, truly equivalent multi-pattern alternatives."

## Overview

The Neumann U 87 Ai is a multi-pattern large-diaphragm condenser microphone (omni/cardioid/figure-8) covering 20 Hz–20 kHz. It remains a studio staple for vocals and spoken word thanks to consistent polar patterns, a selectable low-cut, and a 10 dB pad [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Equivalent noise is 12 dB-A (cardioid), 15 dB-A (omni), 14 dB-A (figure-8) with signal-to-noise of 79–82 dB-A; THD stays below 0.5% up to 117 dB SPL (127 dB SPL with the pad). Frequency response is broadly flat with a mild presence rise, supporting transparent capture without harshness [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This is polished, time-tested engineering rather than bleeding-edge innovation. The U 87 Ai uses a pressure-gradient, dual-diaphragm capsule, three switchable patterns, low-cut, and a pad. Its head amplifier uses a minimal-path FET circuit with a **transformer-balanced** output and 200-ohm rated impedance—solid, industry-standard choices [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Cheapest equivalent-or-better: **sE Electronics sE2300**—a multi-pattern LDC with low-cut and pads; catalog specs show **lower self-noise (9 dB-A cardioid)** and **higher SPL handling (up to 146 dB with pad)**, meeting or exceeding key metrics [2].  
**Calculation (USA market):** 399 USD ÷ 3,595 USD = 0.111 → **0.1**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Robust construction and decades of professional use indicate high durability. Neumann offers a **global** service network and supports repairs for microphones produced **since 1947**, which is far beyond typical support horizons and strongly benefits long-term uptime [1][4].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The product philosophy is measurement-driven and free of non-scientific claims, and the integrated patterns/filters are practical. However, the approach is intentionally **conservative** rather than innovative, and pricing is not optimized for measurable performance gains versus cheaper equals; therefore the score is moderated.

## Advice

If you specifically need the U 87 Ai’s familiar tonality or client-driven brand requirements, it remains a safe studio standard. Otherwise, for transparent multi-pattern work, **sE2300** delivers equivalent core functionality and objectively competitive specs at a fraction of the price [2]. If you prefer a well-known alternative still below the Neumann’s price, **AKG C414 XLS** offers nine patterns and comprehensive utilities [3].
