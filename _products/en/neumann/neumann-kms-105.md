## Overview

The Neumann KMS 105 is a handheld condenser microphone designed specifically for live vocal applications, first introduced in 1999. Built around Neumann's K50-derived capsule technology, it combines studio-quality sound reproduction with the durability required for stage use. The microphone features a supercardioid polar pattern optimized for high gain-before-feedback, precision-manufactured 18mm diaphragm capsule, and multi-layer mesh pop protection system. With 150dB maximum SPL capability and 132dB dynamic range, it represents Neumann's approach to bringing their renowned studio microphone technology to live performance environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The KMS 105 demonstrates solid technical performance with several specifications reaching or approaching transparent levels. Maximum SPL capability of 150dB exceeds the transparent level for microphones (140dB+), enabling clean reproduction of very loud sources without distortion. Dynamic range of 132dB significantly surpasses the transparent level of 105dB for audio equipment. Self-noise measures 18dB-A, positioning it between problematic (20dB-A+) and transparent (<10dB-A) levels for microphones. The supercardioid polar pattern provides over 15dB rear rejection across the 20Hz-20kHz frequency range, contributing to feedback resistance. While frequency response covers the full audible range, specific deviation specifications are not publicly available for complete transparency assessment. The combination of excellent SPL handling and dynamic range with acceptable noise performance demonstrates meaningful acoustic capability for live vocal applications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The KMS 105 showcases sophisticated engineering in adapting studio condenser technology for stage use. The capsule design derives from Neumann's proven K50 capsule, modified to achieve a precise supercardioid pattern through acoustic engineering. The transformerless FET electronics utilize surface-mount components for reliability and consistent performance. The multi-layer mesh protection system employs three discrete levels of mesh filtration, including a removable nylon-mesh element that provides exceptional pop protection without compromising high-frequency response. Built-in signal processing includes fixed internal EQ compensating for proximity effect and an always-active high-pass filter at 120Hz. The 50-ohm output impedance enables cable runs up to 300 meters without signal degradation. While the underlying condenser technology represents mature rather than cutting-edge approaches, the precision engineering and robust adaptation for live applications demonstrates high technical execution.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

At 729 USD, the KMS 105 faces competition from the Audio-Technica AE5400 at 439 USD. The AE5400 provides equivalent-or-better core performance with superior self-noise (14dB SPL vs 18dB-A), higher signal-to-noise ratio (80dB vs 76dB), and equivalent dynamic range (133dB vs 132dB). While the AE5400 offers only cardioid pattern versus the KMS 105's supercardioid, its superior noise performance and equivalent frequency response (20Hz-20kHz) establish functional equivalence for most live vocal applications. CP = 439 USD รท 729 USD = 0.602. The AE5400 delivers equivalent core performance at significantly lower cost, indicating below-average cost-performance for the premium-priced KMS 105.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Neumann provides 24-month standard warranty with exceptional long-term support commitment, offering service for all microphones manufactured after 1947. The all-metal construction with precision capsule mounting demonstrates robust mechanical design suitable for stage environments. Global service network provides manufacturer-backed support with direct technical assistance. However, documented reliability issues include capsule connection screw loosening, which can cause intermittent signal dropout and requires professional service to resolve. While the underlying construction quality is high and long-term manufacturer support is exemplary, the known mechanical reliability concern impacts overall assessment for professional live applications requiring consistent performance.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Neumann's development approach demonstrates strong scientific rationality with measurement-focused engineering and precision manufacturing standards. Design decisions directly contribute to acoustic performance and mechanical durability rather than pursuing subjective enhancement claims. The adaptation of proven K50 capsule technology for stage applications represents rational engineering optimization, with modifications specifically targeting measurable improvements in feedback resistance and pop protection. Internal signal processing addresses scientifically verified acoustic phenomena (proximity effect, subsonic noise) through appropriate filter implementation. The emphasis on measurable acoustic parameters over marketing claims reflects sound engineering philosophy. Conservative refinement of established technology ensures reliability while achieving performance objectives, though the approach prioritizes proven solutions over innovative breakthroughs.

## Advice

The KMS 105 suits professional live vocal applications requiring studio-quality sound reproduction with stage durability. Its supercardioid pattern and high SPL capability make it effective for loud stage environments and demanding acoustic conditions. The fixed configuration eliminates user error while optimizing performance for vocal applications. However, consider the Audio-Technica AE5400 for equivalent core performance with superior noise characteristics at lower cost. For applications not requiring the specific acoustic characteristics of condenser technology, dynamic alternatives may provide better value and reliability. Ensure phantom power availability and factor potential capsule connection maintenance into long-term operational planning.
