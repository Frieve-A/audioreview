## Overview

Kefine Klean is a compact single-dynamic IEM featuring a 10 mm DLC diaphragm, dual-cavity housing, detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, and two interchangeable nozzles (silver/black) [1][2]. Street price sits at **49 USD** via major retailers [2]. While the feature set is solid, there are aggressive alternatives around **22.99 USD** (e.g., Moondrop **CHU II**) with abundant third-party measurements demonstrating low distortion and competent frequency response [3][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent lab datasets specifically for Klean (standardized FR curves, THD vs. SPL, isolation, channel-matching statistics) are not found at publication. We therefore rely on manufacturer/retailer specifications: 10 mm DLC DD, 32 Ω, 107 dB sensitivity, 20 Hz–20 kHz, interchangeable nozzles, detachable 2-pin cable [1][2]. Third-party data are available for comparators (e.g., CHU II FR & distortion on ASR; GATE measurements on Headphones.com) and used contextually in CP evaluation [4][7].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Conventional but competent implementation: single 10 mm DLC driver with dual-cavity acoustics, metal shells, detachable 2-pin cable, and screw-type interchangeable nozzles [1][2]. Retailer materials also mention N52 magnets and Daikoku CCAW voice coil (treated as manufacturer-origin claims) [8]. Overall, practical and modern rather than novel.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Comparator (equal-or-better rationale):** **Moondrop CHU II**—detachable cable and strong third-party measurements (FR/low distortion) at a much lower official price [3][4].  
**Prices:** CHU II **22.99 USD** [3]; Klean **49 USD** [2].  
**Calculation (USD):** **22.99 USD ÷ 49 USD = 0.469… → 0.5**.  
Result indicates significantly cheaper equivalent-or-better options exist.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Standard coverage from major distributor: **1-year IEM warranty / 3-month cable**; dealer-handled support and 30-day return for factory-sealed goods [2]. Metal shells and detachable cabling are positives, but long-term field reliability data for the brand remain limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Marketing and feature choices (DLC DD, detachable 2-pin, nozzle filters) are grounded and avoid extravagant claims. Absent extraordinary assertions, the approach aligns with measurable, user-visible benefits; however, it does not push state of the art [1][2][8].

## Advice

If you want a relaxed, gently bass-emphasized tuning with stable build and simple voicing options, Klean is a reasonable pick at **49 USD** [2]. For pure value and measurement-backed performance, consider **CHU II** (~**22.99 USD**) or **TRUTHEAR GATE** (~**20 USD** typical market) which have accessible third-party data and undercut Klean substantially [3][4][5][6][7]. Choose the silver nozzle for smoother treble; use the black nozzle only if you prefer more upper-mid/treble presence [2].
