## Overview

The SUPERTFZ KING KONG TYPE-C represents a dual dynamic driver in-ear earphone featuring USB Type-C connectivity, released in August 2024. The product utilizes a φ6mm + φ10mm driver configuration housed in zinc alloy and polycarbonate construction, with claimed frequency response extending to 40kHz. Priced at approximately 32 USD, it targets users seeking direct digital connection capabilities with detachable cable design. The earphones feature composite polymer diaphragms and what the manufacturer describes as "stage-grade tuning," though no independent measurement verification is available for performance claims.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. While manufacturer specifications claim 20Hz-40kHz frequency response, no deviation data (±dB) is provided, and critically important audio quality measurements including harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, and measured frequency response characteristics are unavailable from credible third-party sources. The company's product portfolio historically shows "strong low-frequency lift and uneven treble" that "deviates significantly from neutral audio targets" [1], suggesting tuning approaches that prioritize subjective preferences over measurement-driven transparency. According to evaluation framework guidelines, when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant detail, Scientific Validity is provisionally set to 0.5 pending future independent verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The KING KONG TYPE-C employs conventional dual dynamic driver technology without evidence of proprietary technical advancement. The φ6mm + φ10mm driver configuration represents mature technology widely available in the market, offering no competitive technical differentiation. Marketing descriptions reference "Tesla magnetic" motor designs and "beryllium-coated diaphragms" without substantive technical documentation or patent evidence supporting these claims. The analog-only signal path lacks advanced digital integration opportunities present in contemporary USB-C implementations. Construction materials including zinc alloy housing and silver-plated copper cabling follow established industry practices without innovation. While the detachable 2-pin 0.78mm cable system provides practical benefits, the overall technical approach represents standard OEM/ODM implementation rather than cutting-edge development.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Current market price is 32 USD. Comparison analysis identifies the Samsung AKG-Tuned USB-C earbuds at approximately 20 USD as equivalent-or-better alternative. Equipped with USB-C connectivity and in-line remote control functionality, with noise isolation design comparable to the SUPERTFZ product. Samsung AKG collaboration provides established audio tuning credentials with proven frequency response optimization for consumer applications. Cost-performance calculation: CP = 20 USD ÷ 32 USD = 0.625, rounded to 0.6. The SUPERTFZ product provides USB-C connectivity at moderate pricing, though established audio brands offer comparable functionality and measured performance with proven tuning expertise at lower cost points.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The KING KONG TYPE-C provides standard 1-year manufacturer warranty coverage, typical for this product category. The detachable cable design enables replacement of the most failure-prone component, though introduces additional connection points requiring proper maintenance. TFZ products have shown some minor design considerations including cable memory retention and non-recessed connector designs that may require attention to maintenance [2]. The zinc alloy and polycarbonate construction provides reasonable durability for the price point, though no special support infrastructure or extended warranty programs are evident. Overall construction approach follows industry standards for this price segment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates significant departure from measurement-driven audio development approaches. The company explicitly prioritizes "impactful bass and vivid presentation" over neutral sound reproduction, targeting subjective "fun" listening experiences rather than transparent audio quality [1]. Marketing emphasis on premium materials including zinc alloy housing and silver-plated copper cabling diverts resources from functional performance optimization. Technical claims including "Tesla magnetic" motor designs, "beryllium-coated diaphragms," and "stage-grade tuning" lack scientific substantiation or measurement verification. The conservative technical approach using established dual driver configurations shows no advancement toward achieving transparent measurement performance levels. This philosophy contradicts rational audio development principles that prioritize scientifically meaningful improvements in measurable parameters affecting human hearing.

## Advice

For users requiring USB Type-C earphones, the KING KONG TYPE-C provides basic functionality at moderate pricing. However, the Samsung AKG-Tuned USB-C earbuds offer superior value with equivalent USB-C connectivity and established AKG audio tuning credentials at approximately 20 USD lower cost. The absence of independent measurement data prevents verification of performance claims, making the purchase decision speculative regarding actual audio quality delivery. Users prioritizing measured performance should await third-party testing or consider alternatives with documented frequency response characteristics. The historical reliability concerns across the SuperTFZ product line suggest careful consideration of warranty terms and return policies. For general music listening, the marketing-focused tuning approach may appeal to users preferring enhanced bass response over neutral reproduction.
