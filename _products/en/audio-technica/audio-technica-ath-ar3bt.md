## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-AR3BT is a wireless on-ear headphone featuring 40mm dynamic drivers and Bluetooth connectivity [1][2]. Released by Audio-Technica, a company established in 1962 [4] with over 60 years of audio industry experience, this model targets the mid-range wireless headphone market at 119 USD [5]. The headphones offer Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity with aptX and AAC codec support, 30-hour battery life, and NFC pairing functionality [1][2]. The design features a collapsible frame with swiveling ear cups, synthetic leather padding, and a single sliding control for volume and playback functions [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. While basic specifications are available including frequency response range (5-35,000 Hz), impedance (41 ohms), and sensitivity (97 dB/mW) [1][5], critical measurement data required for audio quality assessment is missing. No measured frequency response deviation data, THD/THD+N measurements, S/N ratio measurements, or passive isolation measurements are available from credible third-party sources. The manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant measurement information necessary for scientific evaluation. According to evaluation framework guidelines for products with insufficient measurement data, this receives a neutral score of 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The technology implementation demonstrates moderate advancement with several considerations. Audio-Technica's in-house design approach provides some technological merit, and the company's 60+ years of audio expertise [4] contributes to technical credibility. However, the Bluetooth 4.1 implementation [1][2] was contemporary at release but is now outdated compared to current Bluetooth 5.x standards. The product uses standard licensed codecs (aptX, AAC) [1][2] without proprietary audio innovations. Technology integration is appropriate with standard Bluetooth functionality and multiple codec support, but lacks advanced features that would distinguish it competitively. The implementation shows no significant technical differentiation that competitors would find difficult to replicate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Current market price is 119 USD [5]. The Anker Soundcore Life Q30 is equipped with 40mm drivers and hybrid ANC, and battery life and Hi-res decoding support are equivalent-or-better [6]. The Anker Soundcore Life Q30 at 80 USD [6] provides equivalent or superior functionality including 40mm drivers, superior battery life (40-60 hours vs 30 hours), hybrid ANC feature not available in the ATH-AR3BT, and Hi-res decoding support. Cost-performance calculation: CP = 80 USD ÷ 119 USD = 0.672, rounded to 0.7. Multiple equivalent-or-better alternatives exist at lower price points, indicating moderate cost-performance value.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Audio-Technica provides a standard 2-year warranty in the US [3], consistent with industry averages. The company maintains a global manufacturer support system through Audio-Technica offices and authorized distributors. Construction features a metal frame with plastic exterior and foldable hinges [2], representing typical wireless headphone build quality. The 60+ year track record of Audio-Technica in the audio industry [4] contributes positively to reliability expectations. However, this product is no longer being manufactured according to retailer reports, which significantly affects long-term support availability and parts supply. The combination of established manufacturer reputation and standard warranty coverage is offset by confirmed product discontinuation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Audio-Technica's design philosophy demonstrates scientific rationality with their stated commitment to "high quality measuring equipment in development process" [4] and absence of occult audio claims. The company's "audio for all" accessibility philosophy [4] aligns with rational market approach. The mid-range pricing at 119 USD [5] appears reasonable for the feature set, with costs contributing to actual functions including Bluetooth connectivity, codec support, and 30-hour battery life [1][2]. Marketing approach avoids excessive claims about scientifically non-audible effects. The conservative implementation of Bluetooth technology and standard codecs represents appropriate rather than innovative approach. The product serves as legitimate dedicated audio equipment from an established audio company without evidence of meaningless expenditures relative to function and performance.

## Advice

Given that this product is no longer being manufactured, purchasing recommendations are significantly impacted by availability and support limitations. While the ATH-AR3BT previously offered solid basic functionality with Audio-Technica's established quality reputation [4], the discontinued status creates concerns for long-term support, warranty service, and replacement parts availability. Superior cost-performance alternatives exist and remain actively supported, notably the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 [6] which provides additional features like active noise cancellation and longer battery life at a lower price point. For current market purchases, prioritize actively manufactured alternatives that offer better value propositions and ongoing support. If this model is still available through remaining inventory, factor in the lack of future support when making purchasing decisions.
