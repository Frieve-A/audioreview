## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-CK100 was the brand’s flagship triple balanced-armature in-ear monitor with a 2-way 3-driver layout (two drivers for mids/highs, one for bass) in compact **titanium** shells. It launched at an MSRP of **649.99 USD** with rated **20 Hz–18 kHz** bandwidth, **113 dB/mW** sensitivity, and **23 Ω** impedance; at release it was advertised as the “world’s smallest” triple-driver IEM [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Published specs top out at **18 kHz** rather than 20 kHz [1]. Sensitivity (**113 dB/mW**) and impedance (**23 Ω**) are adequate for portable sources [1]. Because comprehensive third-party lab measurements for the CK100 itself (e.g., THD, channel balance, crosstalk) are not publicly available, we follow the rule to assign **0.5** when full measurement coverage is unknown [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

For its time, the CK100’s triple-BA execution, miniaturized packaging, and **titanium** housings were competent, though subsequent low-cost IEMs have matched or surpassed such engineering at far lower prices.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Comparator: **KZ EDC Pro** — chosen strictly on **measurement** grounds and **lowest price**.  
- **Measured data (RAA)**: professional report lists average **impedance ~27 Ω** and the **voltage for 90 dB SPL = −39.1 dBV**; this corresponds to ≈**113.4 dB SPL/mW**, i.e., not inferior to the CK100’s **113 dB/mW** spec [4]. The RAA report includes full-band FR plots.  
- **Official price**: **14.00 USD** on the KZ official store [3].

Using USD for parity with the CK100 MSRP, the value ratio is ≈**0.022**, which maps to **0.0** on our scale. CK100’s cost-performance is therefore **extremely poor** relative to the cheapest measurement-non-inferior alternative.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Audio-Technica U.S. warranty coverage is established; products must be delivered to service **prepaid** by the end user. Validated warranty repairs cover return shipping, parts, and labor [5]. As a discontinued model, parts availability is uncertain despite strong brand-level support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The CK100 reflects rational, audio-specific engineering (multi-BA with rigid housings), but its premium pricing was not tied to measurement-verified advantages that remain competitive today.

## Advice

**Not recommended** on value grounds. If you want baseline value with measurement backing, **KZ EDC Pro** is the lowest-price, non-inferior comparator used here [3][4]. Seek current IEMs with transparent, third-party measurements for better objective performance per dollar.
