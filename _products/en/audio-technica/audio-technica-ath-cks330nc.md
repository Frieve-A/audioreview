## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-CKS330NC is a 2024 model that adds active noise cancellation functionality to the company's popular USB-C earphones "ATH-CKS330C". It combines the heavy bass sound characteristic of the SOLID BASS series, which boasts cumulative sales of 5 million units, with latency-free digital audio transmission through direct USB-C connection. The feedforward ANC function can be toggled ON/OFF with an inline controller button, achieving the convenience of charging-free operation as a rare wired ANC earphone.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Measured specifications include a frequency response of 5-30kHz, sensitivity of 105dB/mW, and an impedance of 18Î©. Support for 96kHz/24bit digital audio enables high-resolution source playback, with signal processing through the built-in DAC also expected. However, detailed distortion characteristic data crucial for transparency evaluation, such as THD (ideally below 0.01%), S/N ratio (ideally above 105dB), and crosstalk (ideally below -70dB), are not publicly available, making verification of transparent-level audio quality impossible. The ANC performance also lacks specific noise reduction values (above 30dB is excellent), and there are technical limitations to the feedforward method. Due to the insufficient transparency of measurement data, the scientific validity receives a conservative evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The implementation of active noise cancellation in wired earphones via a USB-C connection is technically noteworthy. Since ANC functions typically require a power source, their inclusion in wired models is unusual and represents a rational design that utilizes the power supply from the USB-C port. Audio-Technica's acoustic technologies are deployed, including the SOLID BASS series' unique Pressure Relief structure and SOLID BASS HD drivers. However, feedforward ANC is a technically basic approach, and the technology level is moderate compared to the latest hybrid ANC technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Evaluated as wired earphones equipped with a USB-C connection, built-in DAC, and active noise cancellation functionality at a market price of 34 USD. Extensive market research revealed that while competing products with equivalent functions (USB-C, built-in DAC, ANC) exist, such as the Samsung AKG Type-C ANC version (estimated equivalent of 37 USD), they are all more expensive than this product. Therefore, as this product is one of the most affordable options with comparable features, its cost-performance is rated at 1.0. While cheaper USB-C earphones like the JBL Tune 310C (approx. 25 USD) are available, they are not considered comparable as they lack ANC functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio-Technica is an established audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1962, with a high reputation for reliability within the industry. Product warranty and after-sales support systems are well-established, and the SOLID BASS series is a mature product line with cumulative sales of 5 million units. However, as a relatively new model, long-term reliability data is limited, and the durability of the USB-C connection requires future verification. Overall, reliability above the industry average can be expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Latency-free digital audio transmission through a direct USB-C connection and ANC functionality without charging requirements represent a rational approach suited to the modern mobile device environment. With the phasing out of 3.5mm jacks, support for USB-C connections is an inevitable evolutionary direction. The adoption of feedforward ANC can be considered a realistic choice considering the power constraints in wired applications. However, there is room for adopting more advanced hybrid ANC technology, and the design philosophy, while solid, has conservative aspects. Functions are implemented based on scientific evidence, eliminating any occult elements.

## Advice

The ATH-CKS330NC is a rare product that meets the specific need for active noise cancellation while maintaining a wired connection. It is optimal for use with modern smartphones and laptops that only have USB-C ports, where users want to avoid Bluetooth latency and connection troubles. It is a valuable choice, particularly for users who prioritize audio synchronization in gaming or video viewing, and for those who want to use ANC functionality without worrying about battery depletion. However, in terms of sound quality, it is not exceptionally outstanding compared to other wired earphones in the same price range, so those prioritizing pure sound quality should consider other options. Purchase is recommended with the understanding that its ANC performance does not match that of the latest wireless models.
