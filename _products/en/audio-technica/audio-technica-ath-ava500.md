## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-AVA500 is an open-back dynamic headphone released in June 2015, featuring 53mm neodymium magnet drivers with CCAW voice coils. Positioned as an entry-level audiophile option, it offers basic specifications including 15-27,000 Hz frequency response, 96 dB/mW sensitivity, and 35Ω impedance. Despite using conventional technologies, the product demonstrates Audio-Technica's competent engineering approach to affordable open-back headphone design for home listening applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. While manufacturer specifications provide basic operational parameters (frequency response 15-27,000 Hz, sensitivity 96 dB/mW, impedance 35Ω), no credible third-party measurements for audio quality-relevant metrics (THD, S/N ratio, IMD, crosstalk) are available [1]. The frequency response specification without deviation tolerance provides insufficient information for quality assessment. Without measurable performance data from independent sources, this evaluation defaults to 0.5 as specified for products lacking sufficient measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ATH-AVA500 uses conventional dynamic driver technology with neodymium magnets and CCAW voice coils, representing mature implementations from 2015 without notable innovation. Technology evaluation reveals use of established approaches: competitive OEM/ODM-level product using outdated mature technology, standard dynamic driver implementation offering no technical differentiation, and analog/mechanical-only design without digital integration. While CCAW voice coils provide lightweight construction benefits, the overall technical approach lacks advancement that would distinguish it from contemporary alternatives.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price of 40 USD shows limited cost-performance opportunities due to insufficient measurement data for valid comparisons. While products like the Samson SR850 (approximately 35 USD) exist with similar specifications, the lack of credible third-party measurement data for both products prevents valid performance-based comparison [3]. When measured performance data is unavailable for review target and potential comparators, and no equivalent-or-better alternatives with confirmed measurement data can be identified, the review target is treated as the cheapest equivalent option available. CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Audio-Technica provides standard 2-year warranty with global manufacturer support infrastructure [2]. The simple dynamic driver construction is inherently robust with few failure points, benefiting from Audio-Technica's established track record since 1962. However, no specific long-term reliability data is available for this model, and support duration follows industry-standard periods. The straightforward mechanical design minimizes potential failure modes compared to complex electronic products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ATH-AVA500 represents a conventional approach to headphone design using mature technologies without significant innovation. Design philosophy lacks measurement-focused scientific improvement emphasis and technical documentation. Released in 2015, it represents iteration of existing designs without clear advancement, using only conventional analog technologies without digital integration or advanced features. While engineering is competent, the conservative approach following established design patterns indicates limited rational progression toward transparent performance levels.

## Advice

For budget-conscious users seeking entry-level open-back headphones, the ATH-AVA500 offers competent performance at current market prices around 40 USD. Due to limited third-party measurement data availability, direct performance comparisons with alternatives cannot be conclusively established. The Philips SHP9500 (approximately 75 USD) offers broader frequency response specifications but commands a significant price premium [4]. The ATH-AVA500 suits users prioritizing Audio-Technica brand reliability and established manufacturer support infrastructure. Recommended for users seeking proven brand quality with standard warranty coverage at entry-level pricing.
