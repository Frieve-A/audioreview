## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-P100M is an open-back dynamic headphone released in 2008, specifically designed for extended PC listening sessions. Featuring a lightweight 60-gram construction with 30mm drivers and 32-ohm impedance, this budget-oriented model targets users seeking basic open-back functionality at an accessible price point. Currently available in the US market for approximately 32 USD, the product represents Audio-Technica's approach to providing fundamental headphone functionality without premium features or advanced engineering.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. While manufacturer specifications provide basic information including 20-20,000Hz frequency response range, 93dB/mW sensitivity, and 32-ohm impedance, critical audio quality metrics remain unavailable. No credible third-party measurements were found for harmonic distortion (THD/THD+N), signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), dynamic range, frequency response deviation (±dB), intermodulation distortion (IMD), or crosstalk measurements. The open-back design inherently provides minimal sound isolation. Without verified measurement data demonstrating actual performance characteristics according to established evaluation standards, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 per framework guidelines for insufficient data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ATH-P100M employs conventional 30mm dynamic driver technology in a basic open-back configuration. Starting from base score 0.5, the technology receives deductions: -0.1 for using only outdated/mature technology from 2008 with no recent advancement, and -0.1 for pure analog/mechanical approach lacking modern digital integration or advanced materials science. While Audio-Technica demonstrates competent in-house design (+0.1) in achieving the lightweight 60-gram construction, the overall technology represents mature, widely-available approaches without distinctive innovation or competitive advantage that other companies would want to adopt. The result is a score of 0.4, reflecting basic engineering competence without technological sophistication.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

The ATH-P100M represents the world's cheapest over-ear open-back headphone with equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance at the current market price of 32 USD. With specifications of 20Hz-20kHz frequency response, 93dB/mW sensitivity, and 32-ohm impedance, no cheaper over-ear open-back headphone with equivalent-or-better performance was found. Comparison with clip-on headphones with significantly different wearing comfort is inappropriate, so only products with the same wearing form factor (over-ear) and equivalent-or-better performance were considered as comparison targets. CP = 1.0 (no cheaper equivalent-or-better alternatives exist).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio-Technica provides comprehensive global support including two-year standard warranty with validated repair coverage for parts, labor, and return shipping. The simple dynamic driver construction with minimal moving parts suggests inherent reliability advantages compared to more complex designs. Global manufacturer support infrastructure ensures direct repair services and replacement parts availability. Audio-Technica's established track record in professional and consumer audio markets demonstrates consistent reliability standards. The lightweight construction and basic component design reduce potential failure points, supporting long-term durability expectations for this price tier.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio-Technica's approach with the ATH-P100M demonstrates rational design prioritizing functional performance over marketing-driven features. The company's stated focus on natural, accurate sound reproduction based on measurement aligns with scientific validity principles. The "audio for all" philosophy is effectively implemented through efficient cost structure without sacrificing essential audio functionality. Design costs directly contribute to user-facing performance without excessive materials or luxury positioning. The basic technology approach avoids unnecessary complexity while maintaining appropriate functionality for intended PC listening applications. No occult audio claims or scientifically questionable marketing approaches are present.

## Advice

The ATH-P100M provides basic open-back functionality and represents the world's best cost-performance for over-ear open-back headphones. The lightweight design makes it suitable for extended PC listening sessions, and it is recommended for users with existing brand preference for Audio-Technica. As no cheaper over-ear open-back headphone with equivalent-or-better performance exists, it represents the optimal choice for users seeking over-ear open-back headphones. Clip-on headphones offer significantly different wearing comfort, so consideration of wearing form factor differences is important when making purchasing decisions.
