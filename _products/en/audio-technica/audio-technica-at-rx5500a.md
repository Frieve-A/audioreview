## Overview

The Audio-Technica AT-RX5500A is a premium "Rexat" series automotive RCA cable featuring 7N-Class D.U.C.C. ultra-high purity copper conductor (99.99999% purity) and 64 titanium alloy machined connectors. This made-to-order cable targets high-end automotive audio installations with specialized vibration isolation through silk braided sheathing and dual-layer aluminum-brass cable stabilizers. Released in 2017, the 5-meter version emphasizes premium materials and automotive-specific construction for car audio enthusiasts seeking luxury cable solutions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The AT-RX5500A lacks publicly available measurement data for key audio performance metrics including frequency response deviation, THD+N, SNR, and crosstalk specifications. Manufacturer specifications such as core wire resistance of 19mΩ/m and conductor cross-sectional area of 1.0mm²×2 fall within acceptable ranges for automotive RCA applications. Independent testing of similar RCA cables shows frequency response differences typically within ±0.04 dB across the audio band, below audibility [1]. Given the ultra-high price and claims implied by premium materials without ABX/blind evidence of audibility, the scientific validity is evaluated as 0.0 per measurement-first criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The technology employs mature approaches without significant innovation. The 7N-Class D.U.C.C. copper conductor represents specialized but established ultra-high purity technology, while titanium alloy connectors use premium materials in standard applications. The silk braided vibration dampening and press-fit assembly structure address automotive-specific requirements effectively. However, the analog-only approach lacks digital integration or cutting-edge manufacturing advances found in contemporary cable designs, representing traditional high-end construction rather than technological leadership.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The AT-RX5500A is available through Audio-Technica Japan as a made-to-order product with confirmed pricing over 2,700 USD for the 5-meter version. KnuKonceptz Krystal RCA cables offer equivalent automotive functionality with OFC conductors, multiple shielding layers, gold-plated connectors, and twisted pair construction optimized for car audio environments at 35 USD for comparable length [2]. Equipped with automotive-grade shielding and twisted pair geometry for noise rejection, gold-plated connectors for signal integrity, and sufficient conductor cross-section for automotive applications, the measured performance characteristics including frequency response and signal-to-noise ratio are equivalent-or-better than the review target specifications. CP = 35 USD ÷ 2,700 USD = 0.013.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Audio-Technica provides global manufacturer support through established service networks with lifetime warranty coverage on premium cables in select markets [3]. The made-to-order production model ensures quality control consistency, while simple cable construction with premium materials suggests high intrinsic reliability. Automotive environments present unique thermal and vibration challenges, though the press-fit assembly structure and dual-layer cable stabilizer address these concerns appropriately. Standard two-year warranty coverage applies in most markets with comprehensive repair service infrastructure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy emphasizes premium materials and subjective qualities over measurable performance improvements. Investment in 7N-class copper conductors and titanium connectors represents costly implementations without demonstrated audible benefits in typical automotive applications. The made-to-order production model increases costs while focusing on luxury positioning rather than performance optimization. While automotive-specific considerations like vibration isolation and thermal resistance are appropriate, the overall rationale is weak relative to measurable outcomes.

## Advice

The AT-RX5500A serves customers seeking ultra-premium automotive cables with luxury materials regardless of cost-performance considerations. At 2,700 USD for the 5-meter version, this made-to-order cable requires direct inquiry with Audio-Technica Japan. For practical automotive audio applications, equivalent functionality and performance are available through well-engineered alternatives at transparent, accessible prices. Consider KnuKonceptz Krystal or similar automotive-grade RCA cables offering gold-plated connectors, OFC conductors, and appropriate shielding for standard installations at approximately 98% cost savings. Reserve consideration of the AT-RX5500A for specialized applications where made-to-order exclusivity and premium materials justify the substantial cost premiums over functionally equivalent alternatives.
