## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-M20x is the entry model of the M-Series: closed-back, over-ear, 40 mm dynamic drivers (neodymium, CCAW), fixed 3.0 m cable. Official specs list **47 Ω impedance**, **96 dB sensitivity**, and **~190 g** weight (w/o cable). It targets budget buyers needing straightforward tracking cans.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Independent measurements broadly agree on a **neutral-leaning midrange** with **audible roll-off below ~70–100 Hz** and **treble irregularities around ~5–10 kHz**. Weighted total harmonic distortion is **~0.18% at 90–100 dB SPL** (generally inaudible). **Passive isolation is weak** overall—about **~12 dB average**, with little attenuation in bass and stronger attenuation in upper treble (≈ 25–35 dB near 8 kHz). These traits suit tracking/editing in quiet rooms but are sub-optimal for bass-critical work or loud environments.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Conventional 40 mm dynamic drivers in a basic closed-back shell. No detachable cable, no active circuitry, and no novel acoustic tech. Practical and simple rather than innovative.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Typical street price is **59 USD** (US) / **¥7,700** (JP). Among **equal-or-better closed-back studio** options widely available at retail, **AKG K92** is a credible reference point at **79 USD** (US) and **¥8,580** (JP). With comparable use-case and no cheaper validated alternative at this performance level, the ATH-M20x maximizes cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Lightweight plastics and a fixed long cable are the main wear points, but the design is simple and passive. Audio-Technica’s global support network covers basic parts and service.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The product prioritizes affordability and a safe tuning for general tracking. Trade-offs are **limited isolation** and **sub-bass extension**, which constrain use in noisy spaces or detail-critical bass work.

## Advice

If you require **strong isolation** or a **detachable cable**, step up within the M-Series or rival studio lines. If you work in quiet rooms and value price over features, the ATH-M20x is a sensible buy around **59 USD**.
