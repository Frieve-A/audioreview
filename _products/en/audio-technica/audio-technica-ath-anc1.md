## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-ANC1 QuietPoint is a discontinued on-ear active noise-canceling headphone originally released in 2009. It features an external ANC module design that eliminates up to 85% of ambient noise according to manufacturer claims, with 18dB maximum noise reduction [1]. The lightweight fold-up design includes 36mm drivers, 130-ohm impedance, and approximately 40-hour battery life from a single AAA battery. Despite its age, the headphones continue to function in passive mode when the battery dies, making them usable for basic audio playback.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The ATH-ANC1 lacks comprehensive third-party measurement data necessary for proper audio quality evaluation. Available manufacturer specifications include frequency response of 10-20,000 Hz, sensitivity of 105 dB/mW in active mode, and 18dB maximum noise cancellation performance [1]. Critical measurements such as THD+N, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, intermodulation distortion, and frequency response deviation are unavailable. The single measurable indicator—ANC performance of 18dB—falls between problematic and transparent levels for noise-canceling headphones. Due to insufficient measurement data, this receives a baseline evaluation reflecting the inability to assess scientific validity properly.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The ATH-ANC1 represents outdated technology from 2009, utilizing analog-only ANC circuitry housed in an external module attached to the cable [1]. This approach was already considered inferior when released, as competing manufacturers were integrating ANC directly into headphone housings. The product lacks any digital signal processing, software integration, or modern connectivity features. No proprietary patent technology or innovative design elements distinguish it from contemporary alternatives. The external module design demonstrates poor technological integration compared to current standards, and no manufacturer would adopt this approach today given superior alternatives available.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. At the current used market price of 109 USD including shipping costs [2], the ATH-ANC1 faces competition from superior alternatives. Comparison target OneOdio Focus A6 (69.99 USD) provides equivalent-or-better performance with superior noise reduction (~79% vs 85% claimed), equivalent 40-hour battery life, and advanced Bluetooth 6.0 connectivity with LDAC support [3]. CP = 69.99 USD ÷ 109 USD = 0.6. The OneOdio Focus A6 represents a significantly cheaper alternative with enhanced functionality and measured performance, demonstrating the ATH-ANC1's poor cost-performance despite its discontinued status.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Audio-Technica provided a two-year limited warranty from date of purchase covering defects in materials and workmanship, though warranty support for this discontinued model is no longer available [4]. The simple construction with minimal moving parts contributes to inherent reliability, and Audio-Technica maintains an established global support infrastructure with authorized service centers. However, as a discontinued product from 2009, parts availability and manufacturer support are no longer available. The company's decades-long track record in audio equipment manufacturing supports confidence in build quality, though the discontinued status and lack of ongoing support significantly reduce overall support value compared to contemporary products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ATH-ANC1 reflects Audio-Technica's conservative approach from the late 2000s, focusing on basic functionality rather than innovation. The external ANC module design demonstrates poor functional integration, as modern alternatives successfully incorporate noise-canceling circuitry directly into the headphone housing. The product lacks adoption of digital signal processing, software features, or connectivity advances that characterize rational modern audio product development. While Audio-Technica has since adopted more measurement-focused approaches in high-end models [5], this specific product predates their advanced scientific methodology. The design philosophy represents an outdated, non-innovative approach that prioritizes simplicity over performance optimization.

## Advice

The ATH-ANC1 offers poor value at current used market prices around 109 USD including shipping costs. While the external module design allows continued operation in passive mode when the ANC battery depletes, superior alternatives like the OneOdio Focus A6 at 69.99 USD offer significantly better noise cancellation performance, modern connectivity, and equivalent battery life at substantially lower cost. The ATH-ANC1's discontinued status means no warranty support or parts availability, further reducing its value proposition. Budget-conscious users should prioritize contemporary alternatives that provide superior functionality and performance at lower prices rather than this outdated model.
