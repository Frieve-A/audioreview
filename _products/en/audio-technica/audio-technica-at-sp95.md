## Overview

Audio-Technica AT-SP95 are compact, USB-powered 2.0 desktop speakers using 52 mm full-range drivers and an internal analog amplifier. They take 3.5 mm analog input, draw power from USB, and include a front volume knob with headphone output pass-through switching.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Manufacturer specs indicate **2 W + 2 W** output (4.0 W max), **52 mm** drivers, **sensitivity 82 dB/W**, and stated frequency response **100–20,000 Hz** [1]. No third-party acoustic measurements were found (on-axis response/THD/SN/max SPL). Given the small 5-cm full-range drivers, limited low-frequency extension (100 Hz floor), and modest output headroom, we adjust from the 0.5 baseline to **0.3** pending independent data [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Implementation is conventional: analog amplification, USB power, 3.5 mm input, and a front headphone jack. There is no DSP, wireless interface, or novel driver/acoustic architecture. This is competent but mature tech with minimal differentiation, resulting in **0.4**.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Review target price (denominator):** **34 USD**, converted from a widely available **4,950 円** street/online price using the Bank of Japan USD/JPY central rate for **2025-08-29** [1][2][6].

**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator (numerator):** *Creative Pebble (base 2.0 model)* at **29.92 USD** from a major US retailer [3][4]. It is a USB-powered 2.0 desktop speaker with manufacturer-stated FR **100–17,000 Hz**, SNR **86 dB**, and **4.4 W RMS** total output—functionally equivalent and (by power) slightly stronger than AT-SP95 [3].

**Calculation (display rule):**  
29.92 ÷ 34 = **0.88** → rounded to one decimal place → **0.9**.

Equivalence note: USB-powered 2.0 speakers with 3.5 mm input; FR and output power are equivalent-or-better on Pebble by spec [3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Category-typical **1-year warranty** is listed by retailers, and the simple analog design (few failure points) suggests average reliability; no broad failure data was found. Net assessment remains **0.5** (average) [5].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

AT-SP95’s straightforward design serves basic desktop use, but many rivals offer similar or better output and modern niceties (tilted baffles, DSP, BT) at lower prices. The product’s existence is reasonable but not strongly justified versus cheaper peers delivering comparable fidelity; thus **0.3**.

## Advice

If you specifically value the **front headphone jack** and a clean, compact look, the AT-SP95 is serviceable around 34 USD. For most buyers seeking the best value under ~40 USD, however, the **Creative Pebble** offers slightly higher continuous power and competitive specs at a lower US street price. Unless you need the AT’s jack or styling, prioritize the Pebble.
