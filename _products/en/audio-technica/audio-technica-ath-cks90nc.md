## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-CKS90NC is a wired active noise cancelling in-ear headphone released in April 2010 as part of Audio-Technica's SOLID BASS series. Based on the ATH-CKS90 model, it incorporates active noise cancellation with up to 22dB reduction and features Audio-Technica's proprietary dual chamber system for bass enhancement [1]. The earphones utilize 13mm dynamic drivers with dual position noise cancelling technology and operate on a single AAA battery providing approximately 50 hours of use. Originally priced at approximately 190 USD at launch, this discontinued model represents an early attempt at combining active noise cancellation with enhanced bass response in a wired earphone format.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be fully evaluated due to insufficient third-party measurement data. Available manufacturer specifications include 5-25,000Hz frequency response range, 106dB/mW output sound pressure level, and variable impedance of 90Ω with noise cancelling on or 16Ω when off [1]. The claimed 22dB noise cancelling performance falls between problematic (10dB) and excellent (30dB) levels according to measurement criteria for headphones. Critical measurements including THD, S/N ratio, and frequency response deviation are not publicly available from credible third-party sources, preventing comprehensive performance assessment. The conservative score reflects reliance on manufacturer specifications rather than independently verified measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ATH-CKS90NC featured innovative technology for 2010, incorporating Audio-Technica's proprietary dual chamber design and dual position noise cancelling systems backed by patents [2][3]. However, evaluated from current 2025 technology standards, this 15-year-old analog approach has been significantly surpassed by modern digital noise cancelling implementations. The technology lacks contemporary features such as adaptive ANC, smart connectivity, digital signal processing, or AI-enhanced audio processing. While the dual chamber bass enhancement system represented meaningful innovation in 2010, similar or superior bass response is now achievable through advanced DSP algorithms without additional mechanical complexity.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This evaluation is based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Current market price is approximately 190 USD. Comparison analysis identified the Phiaton PS 202 NC at 79.99 USD as an equivalent-or-better alternative [4]. Equipped with larger 14.3mm drivers, wider 10Hz-27kHz frequency response, and equivalent 95% noise reduction at 1kHz and below, meeting equivalent-or-better criteria. CP = 79.99 USD ÷ 190 USD = 0.4. The ATH-CKS90NC's premium pricing reflects brand positioning rather than performance advantages, with multiple wired ANC alternatives offering comparable or superior specifications at significantly lower prices.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio-Technica provides comprehensive two-year warranty coverage with repair, refund, or replacement remedies through their global support infrastructure [5]. The simple wired design with analog ANC circuitry should be inherently reliable with minimal electronic complexity and few potential failure points. Audio-Technica maintains established service centers and repair processes, with strong historical reputation for product reliability and manufacturer support. The 50-hour battery life on standard AAA batteries eliminates proprietary battery concerns common in modern wireless products. Construction quality benefits from Audio-Technica's decades of headphone manufacturing experience.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Audio-Technica demonstrates a measurement-focused scientific approach, emphasizing "sound quality, not just convenience" with technical implementations like the dual chamber system for bass enhancement [6]. The 2010-era analog approach to noise cancelling was scientifically rational for the timeframe, utilizing established analog filtering techniques rather than unproven digital processing. However, the design philosophy shows conservative tendencies, lacking adoption of cutting-edge technologies that could deliver superior performance or cost efficiency. The emphasis on mechanical bass enhancement through dual chambers represents engineering sophistication but results in increased manufacturing complexity without clear audible advantages over modern DSP approaches.

## Advice

The ATH-CKS90NC represents outdated technology that has been comprehensively surpassed by modern alternatives. As a discontinued 2010 product, it is no longer available through regular retail channels. Potential purchasers should consider that wired active noise cancelling earphones constitute an essentially obsolete product category by 2025, with the market having shifted to wireless ANC earbuds offering superior convenience, battery life, and often better performance. For users specifically requiring wired ANC earphones, current alternatives like the Phiaton PS 202 NC offer equivalent or better performance at 42% of the original launch price. This product would only be appropriate for collectors interested in Audio-Technica's historical ANC implementations or users seeking vintage audio equipment.
