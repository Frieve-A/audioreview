## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-AD500X is an open-back over-ear headphone featuring 53mm dynamic drivers with CCAW voice coils in an aluminum casing with magnesium frame construction. Part of Audio-Technica's Air Dynamic series, these headphones utilize the company's distinctive 3D Wing Support System for fit and comfort. With a frequency response range of 5-25,000 Hz, 48-ohm impedance, and 100 dB/mW sensitivity, the ATH-AD500X targets users seeking an affordable entry into open-back headphone listening. The lightweight 235-gram construction emphasizes comfort for extended listening sessions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurement data from Reference Audio Analyzer is available [3]. Measurement results show sensitivity of 118.3 dB/V SPL (average in 100Hz-10kHz band), 105.6 dB/mW SPL, and average impedance of 54.6Ω (average in 40Hz-15kHz band) [3]. Frequency response measurements were conducted on HDM-X stand, enabling comparison with Harman target curve [3]. Analysis of RAA frequency response graphs indicates deviation from the Harman target curve may exceed standard levels in some regions across the audible spectrum, potentially not meeting standard frequency response criteria for headphones. Manufacturer specifications indicate 5-25,000 Hz frequency response and 100 dB/mW sensitivity, but comprehensive distortion measurements including THD, S/N ratio, and IMD are not included in the RAA report. While frequency response may not meet standard levels, comprehensive distortion measurements are lacking, requiring conservative evaluation. The open-back design inherently provides minimal sound isolation, falling into the problematic performance category for headphones.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ATH-AD500X employs conventional dynamic driver technology with 53mm drivers utilizing CCAW (Copper-Clad Aluminum Wire) voice coils [4]. The aluminum casing and magnesium frame construction represent mature materials engineering without significant innovation. While Audio-Technica demonstrates competent in-house design capabilities, the technological implementation lacks cutting-edge features or proprietary patent technology that would distinguish it in the current market. The 3D Wing Support System represents a unique fitting approach, but this mechanical innovation does not contribute to audio performance improvements. The purely analog/mechanical design excludes modern digital signal processing or advanced integration technologies that characterize contemporary high-performance headphones. Overall technology level reflects established engineering practices without meaningful advancement beyond industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Current market price for the ATH-AD500X is 85 USD (third-party retailers) [1]. The Philips SHP9500 at 79 USD [2] offers equivalent-or-better functionality with superior frequency response range (12Hz-35kHz vs 5-25kHz), lower impedance (32Ω vs 48Ω) for easier amplification, and detachable cable functionality. Equipped with similar open-back design, and frequency response range and impedance characteristics are equivalent-or-better. CP = 79 USD ÷ 85 USD = 0.9.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Audio-Technica provides standard two-year warranty coverage with global support infrastructure [5]. However, the ATH-AD500X suffers from a documented structural weakness in its 3D Wing Support System, with multiple user reports of wing bracket failures affecting headphone fit and usability [6][7]. While replacement parts are available through Audio-Technica's parts department, the known vulnerability in a critical structural component impacts overall reliability assessment. The aluminum casing and magnesium frame construction provide adequate durability for typical usage, but the wing mechanism represents a significant failure point that undermines the product's long-term reliability. Audio-Technica's established support network and parts availability partially offset these concerns.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Audio-Technica's design approach for the ATH-AD500X demonstrates mixed scientific rationality. While the company references measurement-based goals such as achieving "flat response," their marketing emphasizes subjective concepts including "feeling attached" to music and "analogue" characteristics that lack scientific verification. The design philosophy combines legitimate technical objectives with non-scientific appeals to subjectivity and nostalgia. The conservative engineering approach relies on mature dynamic driver technology without significant cost optimization or functional innovation. The 3D Wing Support System, while unique, introduces a structural vulnerability without providing measurable audio performance benefits. The design represents conventional thinking rather than rational advancement toward transparent audio reproduction or cost-effective implementation of established performance standards.

## Advice

The ATH-AD500X may suit users seeking an affordable introduction to open-back headphones who prioritize comfort over ultimate performance. The lightweight design and distinctive fit system appeal to extended listening scenarios, despite known reliability concerns with the wing mechanism. However, prospective buyers should consider the documented wing failure issues and evaluate whether the structural vulnerability is acceptable given their usage patterns. The Philips SHP9500 offers superior specifications and build quality at lower cost, making it a more rational choice for most users seeking open-back functionality. For users requiring verified performance data or maximum reliability, other products with comprehensive measurement verification and proven structural integrity represent better choices. The ATH-AD500X serves adequately as an entry-level open-back option but faces strong competition from better-value alternatives.
