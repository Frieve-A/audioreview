## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-ADX5000 is the company's flagship open-back headphones. It features a 58mm tungsten-coated diaphragm, permendur magnetic circuit, and proprietary Core Mount Technology, with hand-assembled production in Japan. The lightweight 270g magnesium chassis aims to improve wearing comfort. Released in 2017, it represents the technical pinnacle of Audio-Technica's open-back headphone lineup. The price is 208,500 JPY.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Measurement data reveals multiple problems. Harmonic distortion rates reach 1.5% at 90dBA and 4.7% at 100dBA (20Hz), significantly exceeding the excellent standard of 0.05% for headphones and reaching problematic levels. The frequency response shows an unnatural characteristic described as "saddle-shaped response," with a midrange bump around 1.3kHz and absence of the 2-3kHz band necessary for clarity. Multiple resonances that impair transparency have been confirmed, presenting major challenges in terms of fidelity to the master source.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Technically, it incorporates many advanced elements including the 58mm tungsten-coated diaphragm, permendur magnetic circuit, and integrated baffle driver design. The originality and technical standards of the design, including the proprietary Core Mount Technology for airflow efficiency optimization and achievement of 270g lightweight construction, are at a high level in the industry. Including hand-assembled production quality control, this is a product that can be evaluated for its pure technical capabilities.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The HiFiMAN SUNDARA with equivalent or superior performance is available for 25,700 JPY, with the calculation being 25,700 JPY รท 208,500 JPY = 0.123. The SUNDARA achieves superior transparency compared to the ADX5000's saddle-shaped response and high distortion rates (1.5% at 90dBA, 4.7% at 100dBA) through excellent measurement performance including frequency response flatness (excellent flatness from 20Hz-600Hz), low distortion characteristics, and appropriate presence characteristics around 3kHz. No objective performance differences can be confirmed to justify the more than 8x price difference. The 208,500 JPY price setting is extremely irrational in the current high-performance headphone market.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As an established Japanese audio equipment manufacturer, Audio-Technica has a comprehensive support system. Domestic repair support and parts supply are stable, and the company's reliability is at a high level. While specific failure rate data cannot be confirmed, based on the company's track record with other products, quality standards above industry average can be expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While advanced technical elements have been invested, the problem is that the final measurement results do not achieve transparency. Technical investments such as tungsten coating and permendur magnetic circuits have not led to audibly meaningful improvements. Rather, considering the reality that more affordable products demonstrate superior measurement performance, there are questions about the direction of the technology. An irrational approach of high pricing through mass investment in scientifically unverifiable effects can be observed.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the ATH-ADX5000, we strongly recommend the HiFiMAN SUNDARA. Despite being priced at 25,700 JPY, less than one-eighth the cost, the SUNDARA achieves superior transparency compared to the ADX5000 in both measurement performance and frequency characteristics. Specifically, the SUNDARA's flat characteristics from 20Hz-600Hz, appropriate presence characteristics at 3kHz, and excellent low distortion performance significantly surpass the ADX5000's saddle-shaped response characteristics and high distortion rates. With a budget of 208,500 JPY, it would be possible to combine the SUNDARA with an excellent headphone amplifier and DAC, achieving far superior results as a total acoustic system. Even if you have preferences for the Audio-Technica brand or Japanese manufacturing, no objective basis exists to justify this price difference. For those seeking high-quality headphones, we recommend making rational choices based on measurement data.
