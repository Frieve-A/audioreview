summary: "Audio-Technica’s AT-UMX3 is a compact livestreaming USB audio mixer with 24-bit/192 kHz, loopback, +48 V phantom power and USB-C bus power. Officially stated frequency response (USB input → monitor out) is ±1.5 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, while other distortion/noise metrics are not published. Its core streaming functionality matches mainstream rivals but at a substantially lower typical price."

## Overview

The Audio-Technica AT-UMX3 is a USB audio mixer introduced in Japan in February 2024 at around **132 USD**. It targets livestreaming and podcast production with **24-bit/192 kHz** USB audio, **loopback**, **+48 V phantom power**, and **USB-C bus power (5 V / 500 mA)**. I/O is practical for creators: **XLR/TRS mic combo**, **Hi-Z 1/4" guitar input**, **stereo 1/4" keyboard inputs (L/MONO, R)**, **USB stereo in/out**, and a **3.5 mm headphone out**. The chassis is compact at **127 × 131 × 44 mm** and **334 g**, intended for desk-friendly setups. [1][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**Official measured frequency response (USB input → monitor output): ±1.5 dB (20 Hz–20 kHz)** under defined conditions (loopback ON, max USB input, medium monitor volume @1 kHz) [1]. This is outside a transparency-target of ±0.5 dB. No official THD+N, S/N, or dynamic-range plots are published. While the device supports **24-bit/192 kHz** conversion, the absence of comprehensive distortion/noise data limits quantitative assessment; therefore the score remains conservative.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The AT-UMX3 combines established elements—24-bit/192 kHz USB audio, USB-C bus power, loopback, and phantom power—without disclosed proprietary converter topologies or novel DSP. Implementation quality appears competent, but nothing suggests category-leading innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Comparison target (equal or better key functionality):** **Yamaha AG03MK2**—a mainstream streaming mixer/interface offering **24-bit/192 kHz**, **loopback**, **USB-C**, and **+48 V phantom**. The **official shop price is 199.99 USD** in the U.S. [2].  
**AT-UMX3 price reference:** launch price **132 USD** in Japan. [3]

With **matching core streaming functions** and general availability, AG03MK2 represents a fair benchmark; it is **significantly more expensive** than AT-UMX3. Within the scope of equal-function competitors verified here, AT-UMX3 achieves the top cost-performance rating.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Audio-Technica’s brand history supports baseline reliability. As the company’s **first** USB mixer, long-term firmware/driver cadence specific to this line isn’t yet established publicly. Warranty/support appear standard; nothing notably above the norm is confirmed.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The control layout and I/O map are aligned to streaming tasks: single-mic focus with Hi-Z and stereo line for instruments, **loopback** for program audio, and **USB-C bus power** for tidy setups. The compact 334 g body and 127 × 131 × 44 mm footprint promote portability. Publishing fuller measurement data (distortion/noise/linearity) would further validate the engineering choices, but the existing design is coherent for the intended creator workflow, warranting a slightly higher score.

## Advice

If your workflow needs **24/192**, **loopback**, **USB-C bus power**, and **phantom power** in a compact desk unit at minimal cost, the AT-UMX3 is compelling. If advanced, verified low-distortion metrics are a priority, watch for third-party measurements or consider interfaces with published full test data; otherwise, this mixer covers creator-oriented essentials at a notably low typical price.
