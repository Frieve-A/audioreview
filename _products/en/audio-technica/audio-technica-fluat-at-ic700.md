## Overview

The Audio-Technica FLUAT AT-IC700 is the flagship interconnect cable in the FLUAT series announced by the company in 2021. It features a triple hybrid structure combining three types of conductor materials: 6N-OFC, PCUHD, and HYPER OFC, along with the adoption of high-purity materials subjected to Heat Relief processing. The FLUAT name is said to be a combination of "Fluent (flowing smoothness)," its etymological root "flu (flow)," and Audio-Technica, expressing the concept of "signal flow as clear as a mountain stream."

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

In evaluating the scientific validity of cables, it is important to confirm measurable impacts on frequency response, crosstalk, and dynamic range. However, no published measurement data exists for the AT-IC700. Generally, in interconnect cables, frequency response changes in the audible range remain within ±0.1dB with proper design, making them difficult for human hearing to distinguish. Regarding crosstalk, achieving -60dB or below through appropriate shield design is not technically challenging. While fine improvements in resistance values can be expected from adopting high-purity conductor materials like 6N-OFC, no scientific evidence has been presented that these improvements provide sound quality enhancements exceeding audible thresholds. For cable lengths of 1-2m typical in audio applications, measurable performance differences compared to properly designed standard OFC cables are considered extremely limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The technical composition of the FLUAT AT-IC700 falls within industry average standards. The triple hybrid structure combining three conductor materials - 6N-OFC (99.9999% purity), PCUHD, and HYPER OFC - shows certain technical consideration from a materials engineering perspective. Heat Relief processing to remove internal stress is also understandable as part of general cable manufacturing techniques. However, these technologies are combinations of existing conductor materials and manufacturing processes, with no innovative proprietary technologies or patents confirmed. The shield structure and connector junction designs also show no notable technical advantages. Within current cable technology standards, equivalent technical levels are achievable by many manufacturers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The AT-IC700 pricing is extremely expensive at 323 USD for a 1.3m pair. As an alternative product with equivalent functionality and performance, the Amazon Basics RCA Audio Cable (approximately 8 USD/1.3m pair) exists. This alternative product adopts oxygen-free copper conductors, appropriate shield design, and gold-plated connectors, providing practically equivalent electrical characteristics. Following the review policy calculation formula with the review target product price as denominator: 8 USD ÷ 323 USD = 0.025, making the AT-IC700 approximately 40 times more expensive than the cheapest equivalent alternative. No scientific basis exists to justify this price difference through improvements in basic electrical characteristics of cables (resistance, capacitance, inductance). The performance required for audio applications can be sufficiently achieved with much lower-priced products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Audio-Technica, as an established Japanese audio equipment manufacturer, maintains general quality control systems. Standard product warranty is expected to apply to the FLUAT AT-IC700, though long-term durability data specific to cable products is not publicly available. Physical reliability aspects like corrosion resistance are presumed to be equivalent or superior to standard OFC cables due to high-purity conductor material adoption. However, information about special warranty systems or quality control systems commensurate with the price regarding connector contact reliability and aging characteristics is not confirmed. This falls within the range of general industry-standard reliability and support systems.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy of the FLUAT AT-IC700 aims to optimize signal transmission characteristics through combining high-purity conductor materials, but its scientific basis is limited. While the concept of utilizing characteristics of three different conductor materials is understandable, objective verification data regarding actual improvement effects in the audible range is insufficient. The direction of improving basic electrical characteristics of cables is rational, but the relationship between achieved improvement margins and pricing is irrational. Despite existing technologies that can achieve equivalent electrical characteristics at more rational costs, the design philosophy excessively emphasizes the significance of specialized audio equipment. Aspects prioritizing material rarity and manufacturing process complexity over objective performance evaluation based on measurement data are evident.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the FLUAT AT-IC700, we strongly recommend first comparing with alternative products having equivalent electrical performance. Products with sufficient quality like the Amazon Basics RCA Audio Cable are available at 1/40th the price or less. Only if unsatisfied with such products would considering more expensive options be rational. When expecting sound quality improvements through cables, we recommend first objectively analyzing bottlenecks in the overall system and prioritizing improvements to major components like amplifiers, DACs, and speakers. With a 323 USD budget, investment in other equipment providing measurable and certain sound quality improvements is possible. If insisting on high-end cables, conducting objective comparative listening through ABX testing to confirm actually discernible differences before purchase is important.
