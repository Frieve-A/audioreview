## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-M40x is a closed-back studio monitor headphone featuring 40mm drivers. Released in 2014, it is positioned as the mid-tier model in the M-X series. It features a frequency range of 15Hz-24kHz, 35Ω impedance, and detachable cables, designed for studio monitoring and music production applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

According to RTINGS measurement data, the ATH-M40x achieves moderate performance ratings. The frequency response shows a notable dip between 200Hz-1kHz, with left-right channel differences of 4dB confirmed in the 100Hz-400Hz region. Isolation performance is insufficient for closed-back headphones, with only 1/16th attenuation in the 6-8kHz band, providing minimal isolation from low-frequency engine noise. Sensitivity measures 114dBSPL with actual impedance of 38.5Ω.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The technical aspects receive limited evaluation. The 40mm dynamic driver and detachable cable mechanism represent standard design with no particular uniqueness or advancement visible. The 35Ω impedance requiring no amplification is practical but not a technical challenge. The 9-degree driver angle is part of basic acoustic design but remains at industry standard implementation level. Overall, it represents a combination of existing technologies with no recognized technical breakthroughs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A comparative evaluation is conducted against closed-back studio monitor headphones with equivalent functionality. Compared to the ATH-M40x's current price of 94 USD, a more affordable option exists from the same company: the Audio-Technica ATH-M30x at 54 USD. The ATH-M30x is comparable in basic acoustic performance and closed-back design, offering similar functionality at a lower price. The cost-performance is calculated based on the following formula:

`54 USD ÷ 94 USD = 0.57`

Rounding this value to the first decimal place yields a score of 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Audio-Technica has a long-standing track record as an established Japanese audio manufacturer with comprehensive product support. The ATH-M40x's detachable cables can reduce repair costs when cables break. However, the folding mechanism with many moving parts poses potential wear risks during long-term use. The warranty period is standard at one year, but information about parts supply duration is limited. Overall reliability evaluation is moderate.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design philosophy is partially rational. The aim for a flat frequency response suitable for studio monitoring is logical, but it does not reach modern transparency standards. The detachable cable is practical, but the overall design is a standard, cost-focused approach. The technical investment required to achieve high-performance audio reproduction is insufficient, and considering that a more affordable product with equivalent performance exists, the rationality of the design philosophy is limited.

## Advice

While the ATH-M40x is a competent studio monitor headphone, it is difficult to recommend for those prioritizing cost-performance. The company's own ATH-M30x, which is approximately 40 USD cheaper, offers nearly equivalent value in basic acoustic performance. The decision to choose the ATH-M40x hinges on whether one finds the convenience of its detachable cable and minor performance differences to be worth the price gap. For those who prioritize an objective price-to-performance ratio, considering the more affordable ATH-M30x would be a more rational choice.
