## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-ANC23 is a legacy wired active noise-cancelling in-ear headphone featuring the company's proprietary QuietPoint technology, originally released in 2011. Positioned as a budget-friendly solution for mobile listening, it combines 12.5mm dynamic drivers with feed-forward ANC circuitry housed in an inline control box. The design emphasizes simplicity and reliability, utilizing a single AAA battery for up to 60 hours of operation while maintaining passive functionality when power is depleted. **Note: This product has been officially discontinued by Audio-Technica. Original pricing was 99.95 USD MSRP with final discontinued price of 69.95 USD.**

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The ATH-ANC23 lacks comprehensive measurement data required for proper scientific validity assessment. Critical metrics such as THD, S/N ratio, frequency response deviation, and distortion measurements are not publicly available from third-party sources. Manufacturer specifications indicate a 20Hz-20kHz frequency response and 105dB sensitivity, but input levels and measurement conditions are not specified. ANC performance shows conflicting claims: Audioholics reports "up to 20dB" reduction [2], while both The Absolute Sound [1] and Audioholics [2] cite manufacturer claims of "up to 90% of outside noise eliminated." The percentage measurement cannot be directly compared to dB values without specific test conditions and frequency weighting. The 20dB figure falls between problematic (10dB) and excellent (30dB) levels according to headphone evaluation criteria. Without credible third-party measurements or detailed manufacturer test conditions, Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated and receives the default score for insufficient data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The ATH-ANC23 demonstrates competent technology implementation through Audio-Technica's proprietary QuietPoint ANC system and in-house design approach. The feed-forward noise cancellation topology represents appropriate contemporary technology, though it lacks the sophistication of hybrid ANC systems found in newer competitors. The inline control box design efficiently houses the ANC circuitry while maintaining wired connectivity reliability. However, the product shows conservative technological choices without advanced features like adaptive ANC, DSP-based sound tuning, or smartphone integration. While the QuietPoint technology provides technical differentiation, it does not represent cutting-edge innovation relative to current market standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. At 69.95 USD, the ATH-ANC23's cost-performance must be evaluated against products with equivalent user-facing functionality. The JLab Go Pop ANC (29.99 USD) provides equivalent-or-better user-facing functionality including active noise cancelling, 10mm dynamic driver, IP55 dust and water resistance, and Bluetooth multipoint connectivity. Both products feature ANC functionality and in-ear form factor as core user-facing functions, making them equivalent from a user perspective. CP = 29.99 USD รท 69.95 USD = 0.4, resulting in a cost-performance score of 0.4 for the ATH-ANC23.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ATH-ANC23 benefits from Audio-Technica's established global support infrastructure and the company's strong reliability track record since 1962. The simple wired construction with minimal moving parts contributes to inherent durability, while the AAA battery power system provides easily replaceable energy storage. The product includes standard manufacturer support with repair and replacement options through authorized service centers. However, the one-year limited warranty falls below the industry standard of two years, reducing the overall support value proposition. The robust design philosophy and proven company reliability partially offset the limited warranty coverage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Audio-Technica's approach to the ATH-ANC23 reflects a mixed design philosophy combining scientific and traditional audio perspectives. The company demonstrates measurement-focused principles through emphasis on flat response targets and stringent sensitivity matching standards, applying a 2dB maximum tolerance between left and right channels. However, the design philosophy also references "warmth of analogue listening" and emotional connection to music, suggesting subjective considerations alongside objective metrics. The conservative technological approach prioritizes proven ANC implementation over cutting-edge innovation, while the simple construction demonstrates some cost optimization efforts. The overall philosophy shows rational elements but lacks the fully scientific, measurement-driven approach that would maximize performance benefits.

## Advice

The ATH-ANC23 represents a legacy option for users with specific requirements for wired ANC functionality that cannot be met by modern true wireless alternatives. Consider this product if you specifically need wired connectivity with replaceable AAA battery power, passive operation capability when batteries fail, and Audio-Technica's established reputation. However, potential buyers should be aware that this product has been officially discontinued by Audio-Technica, which significantly affects purchasing options and long-term support availability. Given the lack of direct competitors in its specific functional category, the ATH-ANC23 offers strong cost-performance at its final 69.95 USD price point for its intended use case, but discontinued status makes it a specialist choice for specific legacy requirements rather than a mainstream recommendation. Most users would be better served by modern alternatives unless they have specific requirements that only wired ANC earphones can satisfy.
