## Overview

The Audio-Technica AT-HA2002 is a Class A solid-state headphone amplifier released as a Japan-market special to commemorate Audio-Technica’s 40th anniversary. It features MOS-FET output devices, dual 6.35 mm headphone outputs, and a wooden front panel finished with traditional Echizen urushi lacquer. Rated output is 1,200 mW ×2 into 32 Ω; frequency response is 5 Hz–200 kHz; S/N is 117 dB; THD is 0.006% at 100 mW/32 Ω; crosstalk is 62 dB (20 Hz–20 kHz/32 Ω). Original list price was ¥140,000 in 2001. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Manufacturer specs (FR 5 Hz–200 kHz, THD 0.006%, S/N 117 dB, crosstalk 62 dB) indicate potentially solid transparency, but there are **no credible third-party measurement reports** for an actual AT-HA2002 unit under standardized conditions. Without independent THD+N/SINAD, crosstalk, and noise floor data at defined loads and levels, transparent performance cannot be confirmed. The MOS-FET Class A topology and high open-loop bandwidth do not by themselves guarantee audible superiority over modern transparent amplifiers. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

For its era, the design is competent: discrete Class A MOS-FET output stage, dual headphone jacks, and an R-core transformer power supply. However, there is no evidence of technical innovation beyond established amplifier practices, and nothing indicates performance advantages over today’s transparent amps verified by modern lab testing. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

**Current market price (US)**: examples include a live Head-Fi listing at **850 USD** and an eBay listing at **1,407.60 USD** (both used). For a cheapest equal-or-better comparator, **JDS Labs Atom Amp 2** is broadly verified as audibly transparent with >2.6 W/ch and sells new for **129 USD**. Cost-performance calculation (using the AT-HA2002 price of 850 USD):  
**129 USD ÷ 850 USD = 0.152… → 0.2** (rounded to one decimal). Modern 100–200 USD transparent amps comprehensively undercut the HA2002 on price while meeting or exceeding measured fidelity. [2][3][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The product is long discontinued and Japan-market-only. Support and parts availability are uncertain; most units are traded on the used market without warranty. While a discrete Class A design can be serviceable, long-term maintenance depends on technician access and parts sourcing for a niche, vintage model. [1][6][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The HA2002 prioritizes materials and craftsmanship (Echizen urushi, wooden front, brass control) over measurable performance gains, and it lacks independent data showing superiority versus today’s transparent benchmarks. As such, the engineering choices favor aesthetics/collectability rather than cost-effective fidelity. [1]

## Advice

Buy only if you specifically value **collectability and craftsmanship**. For sound quality per dollar, modern transparent headphone amps (e.g., JDS Atom Amp 2) deliver dramatically better value with verified performance, far lower price, and available warranty. [2][3]
