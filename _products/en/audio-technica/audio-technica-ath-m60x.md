summary: "The ATH-M60X is an on-ear professional monitor headphone featuring the company's 45mm driver, but exhibits significant frequency response issues with a prominent peak around 2kHz and dips at 700Hz and 3kHz. At 169 USD, competing products with equivalent or superior performance are available at a lower price, resulting in a challenging cost-performance position."

## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-M60X is an on-ear professional monitor headphone that incorporates the same 45mm large-aperture driver as the popular ATH-M50X model. It features rare earth magnets and copper-clad aluminum wire voice coils, with specifications including a 15Hz-28kHz frequency range, 102dB/mW sensitivity, 38Ω impedance, and 218g weight. While the ATH-M50X uses an over-ear design, the ATH-M60X adopts a more portable on-ear configuration intended for use outside the studio environment. The package includes detachable cables, conversion plug adapters, and a carrying pouch, providing the basic equipment necessary for professional applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Analysis of the ATH-M60X measurement data reveals that while total harmonic distortion (THD) achieves "low THD across the entire frequency range" with predominantly second harmonics and no odd peaks, earning "excellent calibration performance" ratings, there are significant problems with frequency response. A prominent peak around 2kHz "adds harshness to most audio sources," and dips at 700Hz and 3kHz affect vocal and string instrument reproduction. When compared against measurement result reference standards, while THD clears transparency levels, the frequency response shows significant deviation beyond the problematic level of 20Hz-20kHz (±3.0dB), presenting scientifically audible issues regarding fidelity to master audio sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Technically, the ATH-M60X employs the same 45mm large-aperture driver, rare earth magnets, and copper-clad aluminum wire voice coils as the ATH-M50X, essentially utilizing proven driver technology from existing designs. The design change to an on-ear configuration for improved portability represents a rational approach, but fundamentally relies on combinations of existing technologies. The driver technology itself is industry-standard, with no confirmed implementation of proprietary technologies based on patents or research papers. Acoustic tuning for the on-ear design, judging from measurement results, does not appear to have been sufficiently optimized based on the latest acoustic engineering principles. The technology level remains at industry average standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ATH-M60X currently costs 169 USD, but the Sony MDR-7506, widely used as an industry standard with equivalent or superior functionality and measurement performance, is available for 116 USD. Despite having a 40mm driver, the MDR-7506 achieves a minimum frequency of 10Hz (superior to the ATH-M60X's 15Hz) and sound pressure level of 106dB/mW (superior to the ATH-M60X's 102dB/mW), with frequency response showing "less deviation from target curves." While there is approximately 5dB emphasis between 2500Hz-5000Hz, this is less problematic than the harsh peak around 2kHz in the ATH-M60X. The cost-performance calculation yields 116 USD ÷ 169 USD = 0.69, which rounds to 0.7. For professional applications, the MDR-7506 has been used as an "industry standard for decades," providing equivalent or superior functionality and performance at a lower price from a user perspective.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Audio-Technica, as an established Japanese audio manufacturer with decades of experience, maintains reliability and repair support standards above the industry average. The ATH-M60X is manufactured under the same quality control standards as other professional products from the company, with no reports of critical initial defects or design flaws. The company provides industry-standard one-year warranty coverage with established domestic repair support infrastructure. As a professional-use product, it possesses the necessary durability, and the detachable cable design helps control repair costs in case of disconnection. However, compared to emerging manufacturers, it does not offer particularly superior warranty conditions or innovative support services, maintaining levels slightly above the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ATH-M60X design philosophy of applying existing ATH-M50X technology to an on-ear configuration for improved portability is rationally sound in direction. However, examining actual acoustic tuning results reveals problems including a significant peak around 2kHz and dips across multiple frequency bands, deviating from the scientific goal of improving fidelity to master audio sources. As a professional monitor headphone, flatter frequency response would be expected, but measurement results do not meet these expectations. Additionally, considering the market situation where products with superior measurement performance are available at a lower price compared to the 169 USD price point, rational approaches toward price disruption or achieving transparency-level sound quality have not been implemented. While the design direction is understandable, the realized results lack scientific rationality.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the ATH-M60X, superior alternatives exist. For professional monitoring applications, the Sony MDR-7506 (116 USD), used as an industry standard for decades, offers flatter frequency response and superior measurement performance at a lower price. If Audio-Technica products are preferred, the ATH-M50X (130 USD) utilizes the same driver technology with more mature tuning and costs nearly 40 USD less. Unless on-ear portability is an essential requirement, no rational reason exists to choose the ATH-M60X. With a 169 USD budget, consider competing products with scientifically superior measurement performance such as the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO series or Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. For professional applications, prioritizing objective measurement performance over subjective preferences and selecting products with high fidelity to master audio sources is crucial.
