## Overview

The Audio-Technica AT-HA60 is a professional headphone amplifier with integrated DAC functionality, released in 2002 and originally priced at 389 USD. This unit features 5 independent headphone outputs with both standard and mini plug connections, making it suitable for tracking work and professional monitoring applications. The built-in 24-bit DAC supporting sampling rates up to 48kHz was relatively advanced for headphone amplifiers at the time of release. The product is currently discontinued and available only through used markets.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Measured performance data shows frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (-3dB) with 1,000mW maximum output per channel and SNR of 99dB or above [1]. The frequency response deviation exceeds the ±0.5dB transparent level but remains within reasonable bounds for professional use. The 99dB SNR falls between the 80dB problematic threshold and 105dB transparent level for headphone amplifiers. Critical specifications including THD, IMD, and crosstalk measurements are not publicly available from manufacturer documentation. The available specifications place the unit in the intermediate performance range, neither achieving transparent-level measurements nor falling to problematic levels. Conservative scoring applied due to reliance on manufacturer specifications without independent verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AT-HA60 represented advanced integration for 2002, combining multi-channel headphone amplification with built-in DAC functionality when such features were uncommon in dedicated headphone amplifiers [2]. Audio-Technica's in-house design demonstrates established expertise in professional audio equipment. However, the 23-year technology gap significantly impacts current relevance, with contemporary alternatives offering superior specifications and more advanced digital processing capabilities. The basic analog/digital architecture remains functional but lacks modern features such as high-resolution DSD support, advanced connectivity options, or software control interfaces.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market research reveals that no current products offer equivalent or better functionality and performance combining 5 headphone outputs (1,000mW per channel at 32Ω load) with built-in 24-bit DAC at a lower price than the AT-HA60's 389 USD. While separate component combinations were considered (e.g., 5-channel headphone amplifier + DAC), available products such as Fosi Audio PH05 provide inferior output performance (310mW/channel), failing to meet the AT-HA60's 1,000mW/channel specification. No equivalent products with matching output performance were identified in the current market. Therefore, the AT-HA60 represents the most cost-effective option among products with equivalent functionality and performance. CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AT-HA60 benefits from Audio-Technica's standard 2-year warranty coverage and demonstrated reliability through a 4.52/5 user rating [3]. The simple construction using established analog and digital technologies suggests inherent durability. However, discontinued status significantly impacts current support availability, with limited repair options and no firmware update support. Audio-Technica maintains a strong reliability track record across their product portfolio, but the lack of ongoing manufacturer support for this specific model reduces the overall evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Audio-Technica demonstrates rational design philosophy through measurement-based engineering approaches and scientific standards for product development [2]. The AT-HA60's integration of digital and analog technologies represented forward-thinking design for professional applications in 2002. However, the 23-year technology gap reveals limitations in the design approach, with the product lacking modern cost-optimization strategies and advanced functional integration seen in contemporary alternatives. While the company shows commitment to objective performance criteria, the specific AT-HA60 design has been superseded by more efficient approaches that achieve superior performance at lower costs through separate component optimization rather than integrated solutions.

## Advice

The AT-HA60 serves users requiring multi-channel headphone distribution with integrated digital conversion, particularly in professional studio environments where multiple headphone monitoring is essential. Its discontinued status makes acquisition dependent on used market availability, typically through Japanese sources. For users prioritizing current technology and support, modern alternatives are recommended. The separate component approach offers greater flexibility, upgradability, and access to current technology standards. Recommended only for users with specific vintage equipment preferences or existing studio integration requirements.
