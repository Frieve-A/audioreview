## Overview

The Audio-Technica ATH-BT04NC is a Bluetooth wireless stereo headset with active noise canceling technology from Audio-Technica's consumer lineup. Released during the early 2010s, this in-ear wireless headset claims to suppress up to 85% of surrounding noise while providing wireless music and call functionality via Bluetooth 2.1 +EDR connectivity. The product supports A2DP, HFP/HSP profiles and features SRS WOW HD audio enhancement technology. Audio-Technica, established in 1962, has built a reputation for transducer technology and audio equipment across professional and consumer markets.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. The ATH-BT04NC lacks critical audio quality measurements required for proper evaluation according to established measurement criteria. Available specifications include only basic frequency range (20-24,000 Hz) without deviation data, sensitivity figures (102 dB), and noise cancellation claims without proper dB measurements. Missing critical measurements include frequency response deviation in dB, S/N ratio, harmonic distortion THD, dynamic range, intermodulation distortion, crosstalk measurements, and actual ANC performance in dB. Without credible third-party measurements or comprehensive manufacturer specifications for audio-quality-relevant performance indicators, Scientific Validity cannot be properly assessed and is set to the default value.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The ATH-BT04NC demonstrates limited technological sophistication relative to contemporary standards. While Audio-Technica applied their transducer expertise to the physical design, the product relies on licensed SRS WOW HD audio enhancement technology rather than proprietary innovations. The Bluetooth 2.1 +EDR connectivity was already outdated by 2011 standards when current implementations used Bluetooth 4.0 and higher. The implementation shows minimal digital integration, following a mostly analog approach without advanced features like adaptive noise canceling, multiple codec support, or sophisticated signal processing. The technology lacks competitive advantages that other manufacturers would want to adopt, representing a conservative approach rather than cutting-edge development.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

Cost-performance is poor based on functional and performance comparison. The ATH-BT04NC is priced at 71 USD (converted from RM299.00 Malaysian market price) and provides wireless connectivity, active noise cancellation, in-ear design, and integrated microphone functionality. When compared with the TOZO HT2 at 39.99 USD, which is equipped with wireless connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3), active noise cancellation (21dB blocking), 40mm dynamic drivers, ultra-wide frequency response higher than 44.1kHz with Hi-Res Audio certification, and 60-hour battery life without ANC [5], the cost-performance calculation shows disadvantage. CP = 39.99 USD รท 71 USD = 0.563, rounded to 0.6. The comparison target provides significantly better technology including modern Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity versus the ATH-BT04NC's outdated Bluetooth 2.1, substantially longer battery life (60 vs ~10 hours), and equivalent ANC functionality, demonstrating that superior wireless headphone functionality can be obtained at significantly lower cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Audio-Technica provided standard 2-year warranty coverage when the product was available, consistent with industry averages [1]. The company maintains established global support infrastructure and demonstrates a good reliability track record across their product portfolio. The simple in-ear construction with few moving parts and robust build quality is inherently resistant to common failure modes. However, the product is now discontinued, limiting ongoing support availability and parts supply. During its active period, Audio-Technica offered reasonable repair and replacement support through their dealer network and direct manufacturer channels. The company's long-standing presence in the audio industry provides confidence in their support capabilities, though specific failure rate data for this model is not publicly available.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Audio-Technica's design philosophy for the ATH-BT04NC reflects a conservative, subjective-focused approach that prioritizes analog sensibilities over measurement-driven improvements. The company's "Always Analog" philosophy and human-centered approach emphasizes subjective experience and emotional connection to audio rather than pursuing measurable performance enhancements. Claims about "3D BASS effect" and SRS WOW HD enhancement lack scientific backing for audible improvements. The product development relied on licensed audio technology rather than investing in proprietary innovations that could advance measurement performance or provide meaningful technical differentiation. This conservative approach resulted in a product that failed to leverage cutting-edge digital signal processing, advanced Bluetooth implementations, or innovative noise canceling algorithms available during its development period.

## Advice

The Audio-Technica ATH-BT04NC is not recommended for purchase due to poor cost-performance and outdated technology. Current wireless earphone options provide significantly better functionality, sound quality, and noise canceling performance at much lower prices. For users seeking Audio-Technica products, consider their current headphone lineup which demonstrates better technological integration and competitive pricing. For wireless noise-canceling earphones specifically, modern alternatives offer superior Bluetooth connectivity, longer battery life, better noise canceling effectiveness, and advanced features like adaptive sound processing at fraction of the ATH-BT04NC's original price. The product's historical significance as an early wireless implementation may interest collectors, but functional users should pursue contemporary options that deliver measurably better performance and value.
