## Overview

The Audio-Technica AT-HA2 is a compact headphone amplifier released in November 2001, designed to enhance headphone performance while enabling shared listening experiences. This palm-sized device features dual 3.5mm headphone outputs, allowing simultaneous operation of two headphones with a single volume control. Key specifications include 300mW per channel output power at 32Ω, frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz, and support for headphone impedances up to 300Ω. The unit provides both RCA and 3.5mm stereo mini jack inputs/outputs, with flexible routing capabilities including through output for connecting active speakers. Despite its 24-year-old design, the AT-HA2 maintains market presence primarily due to its dual output functionality, which remains uncommon in modern budget amplifiers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The AT-HA2 demonstrates performance specifications that meet or exceed problematic thresholds according to current measurement standards, based solely on manufacturer specifications as credible third-party measurements are unavailable [1]. Frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (-3dB, manufacturer specification) sits precisely at the problematic level threshold (±3dB deviation), indicating significant deviation from ideal flat response. Signal-to-noise ratio of 85dB or higher (manufacturer specification) places performance between problematic (80dB) and transparent (105dB) levels, representing adequate but not exceptional noise performance. Total harmonic distortion specification of 0.1% or less (manufacturer specification) meets the problematic threshold exactly, indicating potential audibility of distortion artifacts. Since these values represent manufacturer specifications rather than independent third-party measurements, conservative evaluation principles apply per policy, resulting in a score adjustment toward the problematic range. Multiple key performance indicators cluster at or near problematic levels, preventing achievement of transparent audio reproduction by contemporary standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The AT-HA2 employs basic analog circuit technology characteristic of early 2000s design approaches. Core implementation utilizes an NJR 4556 operational amplifier with capacitor coupling via 470μF capacitors and single 7812 voltage regulator for power management. This purely analog architecture lacks modern technological integration such as digital signal processing, software control, or advanced circuit topologies that characterize contemporary amplifier designs. The 24-year-old technology stack demonstrates no proprietary innovations or patent applications that would differentiate it from readily available discrete component designs. Modern alternatives achieve dramatically superior measured performance using current-generation chips and circuit techniques at similar price points. The conservative analog-only approach represents outdated engineering philosophy that ignores advances in semiconductor technology, power management, and signal processing that could deliver measurable improvements in audio performance.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The AT-HA2 offers unique value through its dual 3.5mm headphone output capability, supporting simultaneous operation of two headphones with shared volume control. While officially discontinued (production completed status on manufacturer website [1]), the product remains available in secondary markets at approximately 50 USD. The Fosi Audio PH05, priced at 49.99 USD new, provides equivalent-or-better multi-channel headphone amplification with superior measured performance. Equipped with 5-channel amplification (exceeding AT-HA2's 2-channel capability) and independent volume control, the PH05 demonstrates superior specifications: power output (310mW vs 300mW), SNR (105dB vs 85dB), and THD (0.001% vs 0.1%) are equivalent-or-better. CP = 49.99 USD ÷ 50 USD = 1.0. Since the calculated CP value rounds to 1.0, the cost-performance score is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The AT-HA2 benefits from Audio-Technica's established global support infrastructure, providing 2-year manufacturer warranty coverage for products purchased from authorized dealers [6]. Simple analog circuit design with minimal component count inherently reduces potential failure points compared to complex digital alternatives. The basic operational amplifier architecture, single voltage regulator, and straightforward power supply design contribute to long-term reliability expectations. Audio-Technica maintains established parts supply chains and repair capabilities for legacy products, supported by the company's 60+ year history in audio equipment manufacturing. Customer service accessibility includes dedicated technical support lines with reasonable response times during business hours. The mature 2001 design has demonstrated operational longevity across diverse environmental conditions, while the uncomplicated construction facilitates cost-effective repairs when necessary.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The AT-HA2 represented a design philosophy typical of early 2000s consumer audio equipment, prioritizing practical functionality and cost-effective analog implementation over cutting-edge technology adoption. At its 2001 release, the dual headphone output capability addressed genuine user needs for shared listening experiences, while the basic analog circuit design using operational amplifiers and capacitor coupling reflected contemporary engineering approaches for budget amplifiers. The design philosophy demonstrated rational cost-performance considerations for its era, utilizing standard components and straightforward circuit topologies to achieve functional requirements within price constraints. However, the approach lacked measurement-focused optimization and scientific validation methods that characterize modern amplifier development. From today's perspective, the technology has shown no progression since 2001, and the purely analog approach has proven inferior to modern designs incorporating digital signal processing and advanced semiconductor integration. The design philosophy remains anchored in early 2000s engineering principles rather than contemporary measurement-based optimization approaches.

## Advice

For users specifically requiring dual headphone output functionality for shared listening, the AT-HA2 provides unique value that justifies its market position despite outdated performance specifications. Consider this amplifier when simultaneous operation of two headphones is essential and budget constraints prevent investment in higher-performance alternatives with similar functionality. However, users prioritizing audio quality should evaluate modern single-output amplifiers that deliver dramatically superior measured performance, then add external headphone splitters if dual output capability is needed. The 24-year-old specifications place all key performance indicators at or near problematic levels by current standards, making this suitable primarily for non-critical listening applications. Audio enthusiasts seeking transparent audio reproduction should consider contemporary alternatives that achieve significantly better frequency response, distortion, and noise specifications using modern circuit design approaches.
