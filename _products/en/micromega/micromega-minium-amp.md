## Overview

The Micromega Minium Amp is a late-1990s integrated amplifier positioned as an affordable entry into the brand’s sound. It provides multiple analog inputs including an MM phono stage and is rated at 40 W ×2 into 8 Ω. Key specifications (THD 0.1%, S/N 90 dB, FR 20 Hz–30 kHz) are drawn from the product manual and specification library [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Objectively, the Minium’s published performance is below modern transparency: THD is specified at 0.1% (transparent amplifiers typically target ≤0.01%), and S/N at 90 dB trails current ~105 dB norms. Lacking recent third-party bench tests, we rely on manufacturer/compendium values, which do not indicate transparency-level performance [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Conventional late-1990s Class-AB topology with a toroidal PSU and analog input switching is competent but dated. There’s no evidence of proprietary circuits or DSP that would materially advance fidelity or usability by today’s standards; modern compact Class-D designs deliver materially lower distortion/noise at far lower cost.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**Cheapest equivalent-or-better path today (bundle):**

- **AIYIMA A07 Max** power amplifier — **USD 70.00** [3]  
  *Key specs:* THD 0.007%, SNR ≥110 dB, FR 20 Hz–20 kHz (±1 dB).  
- **AIYIMA 36 V PSU** — **USD 33.99** [4].  
- **ART DJPRE II** MM phono preamp — **USD 74.99** (street) with **>90 dB hum/noise**, THD 0.01% (typ.) [5][6].  
- **4-in/1-out passive RCA selector** (to replicate multi-source switching) — **USD 21.59** [7].

**Equivalence note:** This bundle restores the Minium’s user-facing functions (stereo power amp, multiple line inputs, MM phono) while meeting or exceeding the Minium’s published THD/SNR figures (A07 Max 0.007% / ≥110 dB; ART phono >90 dB) [1][3][6].

**CP calculation (USD):**  
(70.00 + 33.99 + 74.99 + 21.59) ÷ 675 = **0.297** → **0.3** (rounded to one decimal).

> Reference single-box alternative (not used for CP because it isn’t the cheapest): **Yamaha A-S301**, integrated with MM phono, 60 W/8 Ω, THD 0.019%; current US market price around **USD 379.95** [8][9].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

As a discontinued 1990s model, manufacturer warranty is not applicable. The company remains active but lists no current support program for this legacy unit; typical service routes are third-party technicians. Aging electrolytics and mechanical controls (pots/switches) are common risk points with vintage integrateds. Absent aggregate failure data, we assign a conservative score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Minium pursued sensible, minimalist integrated-amp goals for its time—clean AB amplification and practical I/O—without overt audiophile mythos. However, by today’s measurement-first standards the design no longer represents a rational path to transparent fidelity per dollar.

## Advice

Choose the Minium for collection value or if you specifically want a vintage integrated with onboard MM phono and simple ergonomics. For objective fidelity and value, modern solutions are decisively superior: either the **A07 Max–based bundle** (cheapest functionally equivalent path) or a **single-box integrated** like Yamaha A-S301 (higher price than the bundle but simpler). Unless you need the Minium’s exact form factor, the measured-performance-per-dollar strongly favors the modern options.
