## Overview

Logitechfs Z120BW is a tiny 2.0 desktop set powered over USB with a 3.5 mm analog input and a single on-speaker volume/power knob. Logitech lists total power at 1.2W RMS and a two-year limited hardware warranty, underlining its simple, low-power design for nearfield use. Dimensions are 110 ~ 90 ~ 88 mm per satellite. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

There is no credible third-party lab data (THD/SNR/FR under controlled conditions) for Z120BW. Manufacturer information confirms only 1.2W RMS total power, implying very limited maximum SPL at a typical desktop distance. Publicly listed bandwidth figures for the regional Z120/Z120BW indicate roughly 140 Hz?18 kHz, which omits deep bass and some top-end extension for music. With no stated THD or SNR and small drivers, audible transparency is unlikely; thus a low score is warranted based on output and bandwidth constraints. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The product employs a conventional analog 3.5 mm input, bus-power over USB, and a basic plastic enclosure with no published DSP or acoustic correction. There is no evidence of unique transducer tech, patents, or advanced processing; this is a straightforward OEM-class implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Price basis (denominator):** 25 USD.  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** *Amazon Basics USB-Powered Computer Speakers*?USB-powered 2.0 with 3.5 mm input, claimed **2.4W RMS** total and **80 Hz?20 kHz** frequency range (both manufacturer-stated), meeting or exceeding Z120BWfs basic functions and published performance. Current market price observed at **15.61 USD**. Calculation: **15.61 USD  25 USD = 0.6244 ¨ 0.6** (rounded to one decimal place). [4][8]

Equivalence note (user perspective): both provide USB power + 3.5 mm input; the comparator claims higher power and wider bandwidth, so it is at least equal?and likely better?in core measurable aspects. [4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Logitech provides a **two-year limited hardware warranty** and standard documentation. No widespread reliability issues are evidenced for this simple design; support quality is consistent with large-brand budget peripherals. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Prioritizing USB power and tiny footprint is practical for travel or ultra-tight desks. However, the approach makes no measurable push toward transparency (limited power/bandwidth, no DSP). The philosophy is rational for minimal cost/size, not for high-fidelity reproduction.

## Advice

Use the Z120BW only when you need the smallest, simplest way to get system sounds or voice audio from a PC without an AC adapter. If you want audibly fuller output on a tight budget, the **Amazon Basics USB-Powered 2.0** option is cheaper while claiming higher power/bandwidth. If you can spend a bit more, **Creative Pebble** (4.4W RMS, passive radiators, angled drivers) is widely available and typically offers stronger performance for still-low cost. [4][6][8]
