## Overview

The Logitech Z4 is a discontinued 2.1 PC speaker system (two satellites + subwoofer, 40W RMS) originally released around 2005-2010 with an MSRP of approximately **100 USD**. The system is no longer manufactured and is only available through secondhand markets like eBay. Each satellite contains three drivers (two 2-inch pressure drivers and one 2-inch dome driver), while the subwoofer houses an 8-inch pressure driver with a perfect cube design.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. Manufacturer specifications list frequency response as **35Hz-20kHz** without deviation tolerance, signal-to-noise ratio **>92dB**, and total RMS power **40W** (23W subwoofer + 2×8.5W satellites). While the S/N ratio of >92dB meets sufficient levels for speakers (>80dB per criteria), critical measurements including frequency response deviation tolerance, THD, IMD, and crosstalk are missing. No credible third-party measurement data is available. Following framework guidelines for insufficient data, Scientific Validity is set to **0.5**. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Z4 uses appropriate contemporary technology but lacks proprietary innovations. The amplification is handled by an **STA540 (4×13W dual/quad power amplifier)** with supporting components including **TL074CN** and **JRC 45650** chips. The satellite speakers feature cast-metal stands and high-gloss black finish, representing solid but standard construction for its era. The analog-only design and conventional components provide no significant competitive technical advantage compared to modern alternatives with DSP integration and software-based enhancements. [3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

No equivalent-or-better products were identified at lower cost. Research of current 2.1 speaker systems found only inferior alternatives: **Logitech Z313** (25W RMS vs Z4's 40W RMS), **Cyber Acoustics CA-3090** (18W peak vs 40W RMS), and **Creative Pebble Plus** (8W RMS vs 40W RMS). All alternatives have significantly lower power output and lack the Z4's extended low-frequency response down to 35Hz. Cost-Performance = **1.0**.

**Z4 original MSRP:** **100 USD** when new.

Note: Z4 is discontinued and only available on secondhand market at variable pricing, typically **25-35 USD** for used systems.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Z4 benefits from simple, robust construction with few moving parts and cast-metal satellite stands that resist degradation. Original warranty was **2-year limited hardware**, meeting basic class norms. Logitech maintains global support infrastructure, though parts availability for discontinued products is limited. The analog design's simplicity contributes to inherent reliability, with fewer electronic components prone to failure compared to modern DSP-equipped alternatives. Common failure points include cable connections, particularly near the subwoofer plug as noted in repair guides. [1][4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design philosophy emphasizes marketing elements over fundamental acoustic performance, consistent with Logitech's historical approach of "designing products to price points rather than consumer needs." No comprehensive measurement data is disclosed, and frequency response claims lack scientific validation. The company relies on existing technologies rather than creating fundamental innovations, with development costs largely unrelated to measurable performance improvements. This conservative, marketing-focused approach lacks scientific rationality and measurement-based verification expected in modern audio product development. [5]

## Advice

Since the Z4 is discontinued, prospective buyers should consider current alternatives, though none match the Z4's 40W RMS power output at similar price points. Current budget alternatives like **Logitech Z313** (25W RMS) or **Creative Pebble Plus** (8W RMS) offer significantly less power. For those seeking used Z4 systems on secondhand markets, expect pricing around **25-35 USD** but verify all components (satellites, subwoofer, control pod, cables) are included and functional. If desk space allows and neutrality matters, consider entry-level studio monitors which typically offer flatter response and better measurement transparency than consumer 2.1 systems.
