## Overview

The Denafrips Ares II is a discrete R2R ladder DAC launched in 2020, positioning itself as an entry-level high-fidelity digital-to-analog converter. Using discrete resistor networks rather than integrated delta-sigma chips, the Ares II features 24-bit resolution with support for PCM up to 1536kHz and DSD1024 via USB. The 7.7-pound unit includes FIFO buffering, femto crystal clocking, and both balanced XLR and single-ended RCA outputs. The model is now discontinued; last known typical price was approximately USD 680–700 at launch time according to contemporaneous reviews [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Third-party measurements reveal generally good performance for R2R architecture. Audio Science Review found "pretty good" results with highest distortion products below −100 dB and concluded the Ares II "makes a good candidate" among R2R DACs [1]. However, GoldenSound measurements identified frequency-response anomalies during swept-sine tests ("strange rippling") and behavior changes implying extensive DSP processing; he also noted the AES17 dynamic-range test may be inflated by about 10 dB due to level-dependent THD+N/IMD behavior [2]. Performance is respectable within the R2R category but falls short of the transparent levels achieved by modern delta-sigma implementations.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The discrete R2R ladder architecture represents solid mid-level engineering with 0.01% precision resistors and 24-bit resolution. FIFO buffering with adaptive timing and femto crystal re-clocking demonstrate competent digital signal processing implementation. The linear power supply with toroidal transformer shows appropriate power delivery design. However, the technology level remains conventional for R2R implementations, lacking the innovation seen in leading delta-sigma designs or advanced R2R architectures from competitors like Holo Audio. The extensive DSP processing contradicts the "non-oversampling" marketing claims, indicating inconsistent technical philosophy.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Given a last-known price bracket of USD 680–700, the Ares II faces severe cost-performance challenges versus modern delta-sigma DACs with balanced outputs and higher measured transparency. A concrete comparator that does not concede functionality is the SMSL M300SE, which offers true balanced XLR/RCA outputs and state-of-the-art measured performance at USD 129.99 (general retail) [3]. Cost-performance calculation (using the upper bound for Ares II to be conservative): MIN(1.0, 129.99 ÷ 700) ≈ 0.19 → 0.2. Even allowing for the Ares II’s R2R appeal, the 5× price gap is not supported by objective performance. For further context, the SMSL DO100/DO100 PRO, widely measured to be transparent, also retail around USD 199–219 [4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Denafrips provides standard warranty coverage with established service networks in key markets. The heavy-gauge metal construction and linear power supply design suggest robust build quality typical of the price category. User reports indicate generally reliable operation without widespread failure patterns. However, the company's relatively recent establishment limits long-term reliability data compared to established manufacturers. Firmware update support exists for USB interface functionality, though not applicable to the analog R2R ladder section.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

From a high‑fidelity engineering standpoint, the Ares II design prioritizes an inherently costly R2R topology that delivers lower measured transparency than modern delta‑sigma DACs. GoldenSound’s findings further contradict the product’s “NOS” positioning by showing the so‑called NOS mode is in fact upsampled linear interpolation at 768/705.6 kHz with additional DSP, alongside sweep “rippling” and level‑dependent THD+N/IMD behavior [2]. Investing significant bill‑of‑materials and complexity into an architecture that measures worse—while marketing subjective “musicality”—is not a rational path for accurate reproduction. The cost penalty and inconsistent NOS messaging make the design philosophy scientifically weak relative to transparent, lower‑cost delta‑sigma alternatives.

## Advice

Avoid purchase unless you specifically seek R2R architecture for non-technical reasons. Modern delta-sigma DACs such as the SMSL M300SE (USD 129.99) or SMSL DO100 PRO (≈USD 219) deliver transparent performance, balanced outputs, and stable frequency response without the anomalies seen on Ares II [3][4]. If you have this budget, allocating more to transducers or room treatment will yield far larger audible gains. Consider R2R alternatives only if they demonstrate transparent-level performance without a major cost penalty.
