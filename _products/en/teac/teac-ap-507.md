## Overview

The TEAC AP-507 is a premium compact stereo power amplifier from TEAC's Reference 500 Series, featuring advanced Hypex NCOREx Class D technology. Scheduled for spring 2025 release at 2,199 USD, the AP-507 delivers 170W per channel into 4Ω with exceptional measured performance including 0.0015% THD and 113 dB S/N ratio. The amplifier incorporates premium Muses 8820E operational amplifiers, dual-mono power supply design, and supports stereo, bi-amp, and BTL mono operation modes in a compact 290×84.5×271mm enclosure.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The AP-507 achieves very low distortion and noise figures per the manufacturer’s specifications (THD 0.0015% @ 8Ω/1kHz/12.5W; S/N 113 dB), comfortably below common transparency thresholds [1]. Frequency response is rated 10Hz–50kHz (+0/–5 dB), with 170W/ch into 4Ω providing ample headroom [1]. **As of publication there are no independent third-party bench measurements available; this score reflects reliance on manufacturer data.**

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The AP-507 employs cutting-edge Hypex NCOREx technology, representing a 2× improvement in noise and THD versus the prior NCORE generation [2]. This is an OEM module integration rather than proprietary TEAC architecture. Premium Muses 8820E op-amps and a dual-mono power supply show careful implementation, but core differentiation stems from component selection rather than in-house innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a like-for-like benchmark, the **VTV Amplifier NCx500 Stereo** (Hypex NCOREx NCx500 based) delivers equivalent state-of-the-art measured performance for **939 USD** (factory buffer option) versus the AP-507’s **2,199 USD**, implying roughly a **2.3×** price premium for the TEAC [3][4]. That places value below market leaders, though still competitive among branded compact chassis designs.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Robust aluminum construction, fanless operation, and Class D topology aid reliability. In the U.S., standard coverage is **1 year**, but **Reference 500/700 models are extended to 3 years upon registration** [5][6]. Broader long-term field data are not yet available for this new model.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Adopting NCOREx aligns with a measurement-forward philosophy and yields objectively transparent performance. Pricing, however, emphasizes premium positioning over pure price-to-measurement optimization given the availability of NCx500-based equivalents at lower cost.

## Advice

Choose the AP-507 if you value TEAC’s industrial design, compact form factor, and ecosystem cohesion—and accept a **~2.3×** premium versus NCx500-based alternatives. If maximizing objective performance per dollar is the priority, the NCx500 stereo offerings present stronger value.
