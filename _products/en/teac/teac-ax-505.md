## Overview

The TEAC AX-505 is a 70W+70W (8Ω), 130W+130W (4Ω) integrated amplifier featuring Dutch Hypex Ncore power amplifier modules. It represents a combination of TEAC's audio technology accumulated since its founding in 1953 with modern Class D amplifier technology. The design features MUSES8920 operational amplifiers, XLR balanced inputs, passive cooling for silent operation, and various functions packed into a compact A4-size chassis.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Hypex Ncore modules are generally known to exhibit excellent measurement values. The product's nominal specifications show THD 0.002% (8Ω, 1kHz, 12.5W) and S/N ratio 110dB (8Ω, 1kHz, IHF-A). The MUSES8920 operational amplifier is also known for its low distortion characteristics. However, specific measurement data for this product has not been published, limiting evaluation to estimates based on catalog specifications and component characteristics. From Ncore module characteristics, performance approaching transparent levels of frequency response 20Hz-20kHz±0.5dB, THD+N below 0.01%, and SNR above 105dB can be expected, but verification with actual measurements is necessary. While the possibility of clearing transparent levels in measurement result standards is high, the lack of specific verification data results in a slightly above average evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The adopted Hypex Ncore module is an established high-performance technology, but not TEAC's proprietary design. The MUSES8920 operational amplifier is also a commercially available high-performance component, not particularly innovative technology. XLR balanced input and headphone amplifier implementation are standard functional implementations. The compact A4-size design is commendable, but silent operation of Class D amplifiers through passive cooling is common in modern times. Overall, this represents industry-average technology level, evaluated as a product combining existing technologies appropriately.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The TEAC AX-505's Japanese market price is approximately 950 USD (US market approximately 1,999 USD). Among competing products with equivalent or superior functionality and performance, the NAD C 389 (130W output, XLR balanced input, headphone amplifier, approximately 1,230 USD) exists. The NAD C 389 provides 130W output at 8Ω load, exceeding the TEAC AX-505's 70W (8Ω) performance. Among products with equivalent or superior functionality and performance, the TEAC AX-505 itself is the cheapest, resulting in a cost-performance score of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

TEAC is an established audio manufacturer founded in 1953, but in recent years has focused mainly on professional equipment, with limited support structure for consumer audio products. The warranty period is a standard one year, but information about long-term support such as repair services and firmware updates is insufficient. While the reliability of the Hypex Ncore module itself is high, the overall product support structure is judged to be below industry average. There is uncertainty at the level of emerging manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The adoption of Hypex Ncore modules is extremely rational from the perspective of improving measurement performance. High efficiency through Class D amplifiers and compact A4-size design are also modern and practical approaches. The adoption of MUSES8920 operational amplifiers is also scientifically effective in achieving low distortion. Achieving silent operation through passive cooling provides practical benefits for users who prioritize measurement environments and quietness. The design philosophy of appropriately combining existing high-performance technologies to achieve high performance in a compact chassis is a rational approach that aligns with the scientific goal of achieving transparent-level sound quality.

## Advice

The TEAC AX-505, as a product featuring Hypex Ncore modules with XLR balanced input and headphone amplifier, represents the most affordable option among competing products with equivalent or superior functionality and performance. Compared to the NAD C 389 (approximately 1,230 USD), it offers a price advantage of about 280 USD. In a compact A4-size chassis, it achieves 130W (4Ω) output and can be expected to deliver measurement performance scientifically approaching transparent levels. For users seeking Hypex Ncore technology and XLR balanced input in this price range, it represents a rational choice. However, for those requiring higher output, consideration of the NAD C 389 is also recommended.
