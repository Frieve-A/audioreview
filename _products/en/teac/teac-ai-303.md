## Overview

The TEAC AI-303 is a compact DAC-amplifier integrated unit released by the company in 2023. It features Hypex Ncore Class-D amplifier modules and ESS Sabre 32-bit DAC, pursuing multifunctionality for desktop audio applications. The unit provides diverse inputs including HDMI ARC/eARC, USB, and Bluetooth, with support for high-resolution audio sources including DSD256 and PCM 32bit/384kHz. It represents TEAC's approach to combining traditional acoustic technology with modern digital technology in a contemporary compact amplifier design.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

According to published specifications, the unit shows THD 0.008%, SNR 100dB, and frequency response 2Hz-70kHz. These figures fall within good ranges but do not reach transparent levels. The THD of 0.008% is below problematic levels but represents average performance when compared to the latest measurement results available in the current market. Evaluation is based on manufacturer specifications, though the adoption of Hypex Ncore modules suggests a certain level of audio quality can be expected. However, products with superior measurement results exist within the same price range, resulting in a good-level scientific validity rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The adoption of Hypex Ncore Class-D amplifier modules demonstrates high technical standards. The ESS Sabre ES9018K2M chip-based 32-bit DAC supports high-resolution formats including DSD256 and PCM 32bit/384kHz, providing modern digital source processing capabilities. Integration of HDMI ARC/eARC functionality offers practical value in contemporary desktop audio systems. Technical considerations in details such as 8mm thick aluminum panel electromagnetic shielding and ladder resistor volume control are evident. However, these technologies represent combinations of existing high-performance components, with limited development of proprietary technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Against the current market price of approximately 799 USD, the SMSL AO300 with equivalent or superior functionality and performance is available at 290 USD. The SMSL AO300 features HDMI ARC support, 32bit/768kHz DAC with DSD512, Bluetooth LDAC support, USB/optical/coaxial inputs, 150W@4ฮฉ output, and excellent measurement results including THD 0.003% and SNR 110dB. Calculation: 290 USD รท 799 USD = 0.36, resulting in a 0.4 rating after rounding. The AI-303 shows disadvantages in cost-performance compared to competing products with equivalent HDMI ARC/eARC functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

TEAC, established in 1953 as a veteran audio manufacturer, has established certain reliability within the industry. The company's support structure is at standard levels, with domestic repair response and after-service support expected. Product warranty periods comply with industry standards, with no significant design defects or quality issues reported. However, as the AI-303 is a relatively new product, long-term reliability data is limited. The use of proven components such as Hypex modules and ESS chips suggests basic reliability is secured, though innovative reliability improvement measures or notable support structures are not evident.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Rational design philosophy addressing contemporary desktop audio needs is evident. HDMI ARC/eARC support facilitates integration with PCs and TVs, while the diversity of USB, Bluetooth, and analog inputs is practical. Adoption of Hypex Ncore modules represents a modern approach balancing efficiency and sound quality. The design integrating multiple functions into a compact chassis shows rational consideration for use in limited desk space. DSD256 and high-resolution PCM support adapts to contemporary digital source trends. HDMI ARC/eARC functionality integration provides practical value where many competing products lack such support. However, as dedicated audio equipment, innovative elements demonstrating clear advantages over general-purpose equipment combinations are limited.

## Advice

The TEAC AI-303 meets good standards in technical quality and functionality, but shows disadvantages in cost-performance compared to the SMSL AO300 (290 USD) with equivalent or superior HDMI ARC functionality and performance. If HDMI ARC/eARC functionality is unnecessary, more affordable alternatives exist. For those considering purchase, we recommend making decisions after clarifying whether PC/TV integration is prioritized or pure audio performance is emphasized. The product suits those who value TEAC's domestic support structure and quality control, or those seeking multifunctional integration in desktop spaces. However, considering the availability of cheaper options with similar features, it may not occupy the most reasonable position in this price range.
