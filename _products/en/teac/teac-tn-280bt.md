## Overview

The TEAC TN-280BT is a manual belt-drive turntable for first-time vinyl users who need wireless output and a built-in phono stage. It includes a 30 cm aluminum die-cast platter, DC motor, straight tonearm with anti-skate and an **adjustable counterweight**, a **detachable headshell**, and 33⅓/45 RPM operation. A pre-mounted Audio-Technica AT3600L cartridge and switchable phono EQ are included. The integrated Bluetooth transmitter supports the **SBC codec**. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Manufacturer data state **wow & flutter: 0.2%**, **signal-to-noise: 67 dB (A-weighted)**, and **speed variation: ±2%**. These values are well below transparency by modern high-fidelity standards and will limit fidelity relative to digital playback. Multiple indicators (speed stability and S/N) underperform transparency, justifying this score. [1][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A conventional DC belt-drive with basic anti-skate and a straight tonearm is used. Convenience features include a **built-in phono preamp** and **Bluetooth transmitter (SBC only)**; there is no advanced servo speed control or higher-tier Bluetooth codec. The design is practical and mature rather than cutting-edge. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Market price reference:** **349 USD** (street). [3]

**Comparator rule (user-visible equivalence):** require **Bluetooth output**, **built-in phono EQ**, **adjustable counterweight + anti-skate**, **detachable headshell**, 33⅓/45 RPM, and **measured performance in the same class** (W&F ≈ 0.2% class, S/N ≥ 60 dB).

Audio-Technica **AT-LP3XBT** meets these conditions but is **not cheaper** (official US price **399 USD**). No cheaper model matching the same function/performance set was found. Therefore, by rule, **no cheaper equivalent exists → CP = 1.0**. [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Simple belt-drive mechanics and a pre-mounted MM cartridge aid reliability; TEAC’s warranty is standard for the class (1 year via authorized dealers). Nothing beyond the norm is offered.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The product prioritizes ease of setup (factory-mounted cartridge, phono EQ, Bluetooth) and basic adjustability over measurable fidelity. Given **0.2% W&F**, **±2% speed variation**, and **67 dB(A) S/N**, it does not target transparent playback, but rather approachable vinyl convenience. [1][3]

## Advice

If you value automation over adjustability, Sony’s **PS-LX310BT** is simpler and cheaper, but it forgoes upgrade-friendly arm adjustments and a detachable headshell. If you specifically need **Bluetooth + built-in EQ** **and** the **adjustable tonearm + detachable headshell** combo, the TN-280BT remains the lowest-cost path to that set; note the **SBC-only** wireless path.
