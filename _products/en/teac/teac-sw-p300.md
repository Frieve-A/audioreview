## Overview

The TEAC SW-P300 is a compact active subwoofer released in mid-2015, featuring a 200mm cone driver powered by an ICEpower 50ASX2-SE Class D amplifier delivering 91W maximum output [1][2]. The product includes adjustable crossover frequency (40Hz-200Hz), phase switching, and both line and speaker-level inputs with through output capability. Originally positioned as an affordable desktop subwoofer solution, the product has been discontinued [1] and is currently available only in limited quantities through third-party sellers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. No credible third-party measurements from recognized sources are publicly available for frequency response precision, harmonic distortion (THD), signal-to-noise ratio, or other audio-quality-relevant specifications required for speakers/subwoofers evaluation per the measurement criteria framework. While basic technical information indicates use of ICEpower 50ASX2-SE amplification delivering 91W maximum output, detailed performance specifications with measurement tolerances are not accessible through official sources. According to evaluation guidelines, when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and comprehensive manufacturer specifications cannot be verified, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 with explicit notation of evaluation limitations due to insufficient data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Technology level reflects conventional 2015-era subwoofer design without significant innovation. The SW-P300 employs standard ICEpower Class D amplifier technology widely adopted across the industry, conventional sealed cabinet construction using 21mm MDF, and basic analog crossover controls without proprietary patent technology. Released in 2015, the product represents outdated technology compared to current 2024 standards, lacking advanced features like DSP processing, room correction, app control, or sophisticated digital signal processing found in modern alternatives. The technology demonstrates no competitive advantages that other companies would want to adopt, with easy replication by new entrants using standard components and mature design approaches.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Cost-performance evaluation based on current used market pricing of approximately 265 USD [3]. The Emotiva BasX S8 [4] provides superior performance with better frequency response (28Hz-200Hz vs 40Hz-200Hz), higher power output (150W vs 91W), and equivalent connectivity at 199 USD retail price with full manufacturer warranty. The BasX S8 features superior low-frequency extension, higher amplification power, and modern Class D efficiency with current production support. CP = 199 USD ÷ 265 USD = 0.75, rounded to first decimal place yields 0.8. The cost-performance disadvantage reflects both higher used pricing and inferior specifications compared to current production alternatives with better measured performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Reliability and support are significantly limited by the product's discontinued status. No current manufacturer warranty or support infrastructure exists, with service limited to dealer-based support for discontinued products. While the sealed cabinet design with few moving parts and robust MDF construction provides inherent durability advantages, the lack of manufacturer support, parts availability, and warranty coverage substantially reduces practical reliability. TEAC maintains an established history since 1953, but consumer audio product support has mixed reputation compared to professional equipment lines. No specific failure rate data is available for this model, and the age of remaining units in the used market introduces additional reliability considerations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Design philosophy reflects conventional 2015-era approach without significant progression toward modern scientific advancements in subwoofer technology. The SW-P300 employs standard sealed cabinet design and commercially available ICEpower technology without proprietary enhancements, representing a rational but conservative approach for its release timeframe. While lacking advanced features that define contemporary subwoofer design rationality such as DSP processing, app-based control, or room correction algorithms, the basic design principles remain scientifically sound. The sealed cabinet design and Class D amplification represent rational choices for compact desktop applications, though the approach demonstrates limited progression possibilities as a discontinued product line compared to industry direction toward measurement-based optimization and software-enhanced functionality.

## Advice

The TEAC SW-P300 is not recommended for purchase consideration due to significant cost-performance disadvantage and discontinued status limitations. Prospective buyers seeking compact active subwoofers should prioritize current-production alternatives offering superior specifications, manufacturer support, and better value propositions. The Emotiva BasX S8 provides significantly superior performance with better frequency response (28Hz vs 40Hz lower extension) and higher power output (150W vs 91W) at 199 USD, while alternatives like the Edifier T5s (219 USD) also offer better value with current manufacturer support. For users requiring 8-inch driver solutions, modern alternatives offer measurable advantages in frequency response, amplification efficiency, and warranty coverage absent from the SW-P300. The used market premium for discontinued products contradicts rational cost-performance evaluation when superior alternatives remain readily available with full manufacturer support.
