## Overview

The TEAC AP-505 is a compact stereo power amplifier that employs a TEAC-tuned Hypex Ncore module. **Rated output**: 70W + 70W (8Ω, 1kHz, THD 0.8%) and 125W + 125W (4Ω, 1kHz, THD 0.8%). **Maximum (JEITA)**: 95W + 95W into 8Ω and 170W + 170W into 4Ω. In BTL it is specified at **230W (8Ω, THD 0.8%)** rated and **350W (8Ω, JEITA)** maximum. It supports Stereo, Bi-amp, and BTL modes, uses a fully-balanced circuit from input to output, and includes TEAC’s “Pin-Point” feet for vibration control [1][2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

We found **no independent lab measurements** for the AP-505. Manufacturer specs list **THD** 0.0015% (8Ω, 1kHz, 12.5W, JEITA), **S/N** 113 dB (8Ω, 1kHz, IHF-A), **frequency response** 10 Hz–50 kHz (+0/−5 dB @1 W), and **damping factor** ≥370 (JEITA) [1][2]. These numbers **suggest** transparency in normal use, but they are limited to 1 kHz and low power and are not third-party verified. Moreover, **sub-USD 100** amps have demonstrated similar “transparent-class” distortion/noise in third-party tests (e.g., **Fosi Audio V3** stereo: SINAD around ~90 dB at 5 W; **AIYIMA A07** TPA3255 also measures clean at typical listening levels) [4][5]. Given the reliance on manufacturer data and the availability of budget gear with solid lab results, we set scientific validity at **0.6** (baseline 0.5, +0.1 for detailed JEITA/IHF-A disclosures).

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AP-505 leverages proven Ncore technology in a fully balanced architecture with a toroidal PSU and compact chassis. However, it predates the latest **NCOREx/NCx** generation now used by rivals and does not push the current state of the art in distortion or power. Execution is solid but not cutting-edge [3][6].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Current store price shows **1,999 USD** regular (often on sale at ~1,499.88 USD) [7]. A finished **stereo** power amplifier with balanced inputs and **equal-or-better** published/measured performance that is **cheaper** is the **Buckeye Amps Hypex NCx500 (2-channel)** at **1,050 USD**; it offers vastly higher power (manufacturer: ~380 W/8Ω, 700 W/4Ω per channel at 1% THD) and extremely low distortion/noise typical of NCOREx modules [6].  
**CP calculation** (cheapest equal-or-better vs. target): **1,050 USD ÷ 1,999 USD = 0.53** → **0.5**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Standard warranty/support and a fanless design (no moving-part failures) are positives. No field reliability statistics or extended program are published. Overall, typical for the category [7].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A compact, fully balanced Ncore implementation aimed at transparency is coherent and practical. In 2025, however, newer NCx-based designs deliver more performance per dollar, so the approach is rational but no longer class-leading [1][3][6].

## Advice

If you value TEAC’s compact form factor, build, and styling, the AP-505 is a tidy way to get a balanced Ncore power stage. If your priority is **measured performance per dollar**, NCx-based stereo power amps (e.g., Buckeye NCx500) offer clearly superior on-paper performance at a much lower price [6][7]. For pure transparency at very low cost, budget class-D options like Fosi V3/A07 already measure cleanly at typical powers [4][5].
