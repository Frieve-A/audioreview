## Overview

The TEAC UD-701N is a high-end audio device that integrates a USB DAC, network player, preamplifier, and headphone amplifier into a single unit. It features the company's newly developed FPGA-based discrete ΔΣ (Delta Sigma) DAC, adopting a proprietary design that does not use generic DAC chips. Positioned as a core product in the 700 series, it employs a dual mono structure with independent toroidal core transformers for each channel. The TEAC-QVCS volume control system enables precise volume adjustment in 0.5dB increments. It supports playback up to DSD 22.5MHz and PCM 384kHz/32bit, and also incorporates an MQA decoder.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance shows excellent results that clear transparency levels. The THD of 0.002% is well below the transparency threshold of 0.01%, and the SNR of 110dB exceeds the transparency level of 105dB. The frequency response of 5Hz-80kHz (+1/-5dB) secures a bandwidth that greatly exceeds the audible range of 20Hz-20kHz. All measurement indicators are well above problematic levels, achieving acoustically meaningful performance. While the performance is solid, it does not significantly surpass other high-performance DACs that are available at a fraction of the cost.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The proprietary FPGA-based discrete ΔΣ DAC is an original design. The configuration using FPGAs with proprietary algorithms and discrete circuits, without relying on generic DAC chips, demonstrates technical originality. However, this approach does not necessarily translate into superior performance. In fact, many modern DACs using off-the-shelf high-performance chips can achieve better or equivalent measurement results at a much lower cost. While the effort is notable, the technology does not provide a tangible advantage over industry-standard solutions, placing it at an average level in terms of effective technological advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The UD-701N is priced at 4,299.99 USD. It is possible to achieve the same, or even superior, functionality and measured performance for a fraction of the price. For example, a combination of a network streamer like the WiiM Pro Plus (approx. 219 USD) and a high-performance DAC/headphone amplifier like the Topping DX5 Lite (approx. 349 USD) offers equivalent features including high-resolution streaming, a high-quality DAC, and a powerful headphone amplifier. The total cost of this combination is approximately 568 USD. The cost-performance calculation is 568 ÷ 4,299.99 = 0.132, which results in an extremely low score. There is no justification for the more than seven-fold price increase for the TEAC unit.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

TEAC is an established audio manufacturer with a long history, and its reliability in the industry is well-established. The product's warranty period and support system meet industry standard levels, with no reports of significant quality issues. However, it does not offer exceptionally superior support systems or extended warranties compared to innovative emerging manufacturers, remaining at industry-average levels. Long-term software support, such as firmware updates, shows no notable advantages.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The design philosophy of pursuing high performance through a proprietary discrete DAC is questionable in its rationality. While the all-in-one design is convenient, the decision to develop a costly in-house DAC that does not outperform more affordable, mass-produced chips is a significant flaw. It represents an investment in technology that does not yield a proportional improvement in sound quality for the end-user. The extremely high price of 4,300 USD for a dedicated audio device lacks necessity when compared to combinations of general-purpose devices that offer superior or equivalent performance for a fraction of the cost. The design demonstrates a disregard for price rationality.

## Advice

We do not recommend purchasing the TEAC UD-701N. While its measured performance is good, its price is unjustifiably high. For a fraction of the cost, you can achieve a system with equivalent or even better performance. We strongly recommend considering a combination of a network streamer like the WiiM Pro Plus (approx. 219 USD) and a high-performance DAC/headphone amplifier such as the Topping DX5 Lite (approx. 349 USD). This setup provides all the core functionalities of the UD-701N at less than one-seventh of the price. The massive price difference for the TEAC unit does not translate into any discernible improvement in the listening experience.
