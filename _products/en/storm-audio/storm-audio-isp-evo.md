## Overview

The Storm Audio ISP Evo is a fully digital immersive sound processor developed by French company Storm Audio. Based on ISP Elite MK3 technology with the slim design of ISP Core 16, it is a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree, featuring up to 32 channels of decoding/upmixing and Dirac Live Active Room Treatment. Equipped with professional digital interfaces like AES/EBU and AES67/Dante, it is designed for high-end home theater systems.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The ISP Evo employs fully digital processing to eliminate internal analog conversion stages, minimizing signal degradation. Even with digital inputs and outputs, it avoids potential noise and distortion from analog sections in traditional processors, but detailed measurements for the Evo are not published, preventing verification of transparency levels. The digital design is scientific, but concrete measurement confirmation is required.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Technologically, it combines external technologies like Dirac Live Active Room Treatment with HDMI 2.1 and AES67/Dante support. The fully digital processing is rational, but proprietary innovation is limited to industry standards. No standout measurement performance or clear advantages over competitors are confirmed, evaluating it at the level of existing design combinations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The ISP Evo is priced at approximately 20,000USD. Competitors for 32-channel support include Trinnov Altitude32 (approximately 40,000USD) and JBL Synthesis SDP-75 (approximately 31,000USD), which offer equivalent or better features but at higher costs. Calculation: 31,000USD รท 20,000USD = 1.55 (clamped to 1.0). For 32-channel needs, it provides excellent cost-performance as the lowest-priced option.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Storm Audio has a track record as a professional audio manufacturer, offering 5-year warranty and dealer support. Firmware updates are provided, but as a mid-sized company, long-term parts supply has slight concerns. Reliability is above emerging companies, rated above industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The fully digital processing approach is rational for digital cinema compatibility. 32-channel support is effective for specific uses, though potentially excessive for general home theaters. Measurement data disclosure is limited, but the design is consistent with scientific principles. The necessity as high-end dedicated equipment is justified for 32-channel demands.

## Advice

The Storm Audio ISP Evo is suitable for high-end home theater setups requiring 32-channel processing. Its fully digital design promises high fidelity, with superior cost-performance compared to competitors like Trinnov Altitude32 (approximately 40,000USD) and JBL Synthesis SDP-75 (approximately 31,000USD). It is effective when professional interfaces like AES/EBU or AES67/Dante are needed, but verify actual measurements beforehand to ensure fit for your application. Inquire with dealers for pricing.
