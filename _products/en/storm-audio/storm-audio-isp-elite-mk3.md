## Overview

The Storm Audio ISP Elite MK3 is a French-designed, modular high-end AV processor capable of up to 32-channel decoding and processing. It supports Dolby Atmos, DTS:X Pro, Auro-3D, IMAX Enhanced, and integrates Dirac Live Bass Control. With AES/EBU, AES67/AoIP networking, HDMI 2.1, and 8K video pass-through, it caters to both professional installations and high-end home theaters.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While MK3 measurement data is unpublished, the ISP 16 MK2 measured around 99dB SINAD (THD+N) in Audio Science Review, falling short of the 105dB transparent threshold. Assuming similar performance for MK3, its audible fidelity improvement is limited, warranting a 0.6 rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The proprietary modular platform allows expansion up to 32 channels and supports professional connection standards like AES/EBU and AES67/AoIP. Integrated Dirac Live Bass Control and Expert Bass Management add technical value. However, basic circuit design shows no clear superiority over chipset-based competitors, placing it at 0.7.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The 32-channel MK3 is priced at 25,999USD. A suitable comparison is the Trinnov Altitude32, featuring equivalent 32-channel processing, Dirac Live support, immersive format compatibility, and strong measured performance, with an MSRP of 42,000USD.  

Thus, the ISP Elite MK3 offers the best cost-performance currently available.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Founded in 2016, Storm Audio’s long-term reliability record is limited. While global service centers exist in France, the US, and Hong Kong, direct support in Japan is restricted. Warranty details and firmware update frequency are unclear, resulting in a 0.5 rating.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The “build without constraints” modular approach is rational, but 32-channel capability exceeds typical home theater needs, with limited direct benefits to sound quality. Overall, the price-to-benefit ratio is moderate, earning a 0.5.

## Advice

For a full 32-channel immersive system, the ISP Elite MK3 is currently the most cost-effective choice. If channel count requirements are lower, consider the Trinnov Altitude16 or other 16–24 channel processors to optimize budget and performance.
