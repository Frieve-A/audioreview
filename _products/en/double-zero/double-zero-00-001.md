## Overview

Double Zero 00-001 represents a collaboration between Grammy-winning DJ/producer Zedd and Japanese design team SF Inc., with acoustic engineering provided by Onkyo. Released in 2017 as models 00-001B (black) and 00-001W (white), these closed-back dynamic headphones feature a newly developed 40mm carbon paper driver unit with claimed 10Hz-80kHz frequency response and 32Ω impedance suitable for portable devices. The headphones target both home and portable use with lightweight 224g construction and detachable cable design.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data. While manufacturer specifications claim 10Hz-80kHz frequency response, 32Ω impedance, and 1000mW maximum input [1], no frequency response deviation data (±dB) is provided, nor are critical acoustic measurements such as THD, SNR, or sensitivity available from credible third-party sources. Limited measurement data from Korean audio site 0db.co.kr [3] noted "relatively modest high-frequency levels" but "excellent balance due to deep bass presence," however specific numerical data required for scientific evaluation was unavailable. As credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information necessary for assessment, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 and explicitly stated as unable to evaluate due to insufficient data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The technology implementation demonstrates limited advancement. The headphones utilize a "newly developed 40mm carbon paper driver unit" which was contemporary technology in 2017 but represents mature, easily replicable technology. While Onkyo contributes significant acoustic engineering expertise, the product lacks proprietary patent technology, cutting-edge digital integration, or significant technical differentiation that would prevent competitors from achieving similar results. The purely analog/mechanical design without DSP, software, or modern connectivity features represents conservative technology adoption compared to current standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Cost-performance analysis reveals significant disadvantage. The Sennheiser HD 200 Pro provides equivalent functions (closed-back design, 32Ω impedance, detachable cable) with equivalent-or-better measured performance including 20Hz-20kHz frequency response with THD <0.1% and 108 dB SPL maximum output [2]. These measured specifications establish superior transparency compared to the Double Zero's unverified 10Hz-80kHz claim lacking deviation data or distortion specifications. Current market pricing shows HD 200 Pro at 70 USD compared to the Double Zero 00-001's 199 USD price point. CP = 70 USD ÷ 199 USD = 0.352, which rounds to 0.4. The comparison target offers equivalent-or-better measured performance with documented THD and frequency response specifications, demonstrating that scientifically superior capabilities are available at substantially lower cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Reliability and support present concerns for long-term ownership. While the simple closed-back dynamic construction with few moving parts offers inherent robustness, the Double Zero brand appears to be a limited collaboration project with unclear long-term support infrastructure. Investigation results indicate availability of aftermarket earpad protection solutions, suggesting potential wear issues with original earpads. No evidence of global support systems or established repair networks was found, likely requiring third-party support only. The brand's limited track record since 2017 provides insufficient reliability data.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates mixed rationality. While leveraging Onkyo's measurement-based acoustic engineering expertise represents a scientific approach, significant cost appears unrelated to acoustic performance improvement, with equivalent-performing products available at much lower prices. The product uses traditional analog driver technology without digital, DSP, or modern software integration that could provide user benefits. The conservative approach using established carbon paper driver technology, combined with lack of active cost reduction relative to function and performance, suggests limited rationality in design direction toward scientifically meaningful improvements.

## Advice

The Double Zero 00-001 primarily serves as a celebrity-branded product rather than a performance-focused audio tool. Potential purchasers seeking optimal cost-performance should consider the Sennheiser HD 200 Pro or similar alternatives that provide equivalent functionality at significantly lower cost. Current market analysis shows equivalent-performing products available at approximately 35% of the Double Zero price point. The headphones may appeal to Zedd fans valuing brand association, but objective audio performance seekers will find better value elsewhere. The limited support infrastructure and unclear long-term brand commitment present additional considerations for long-term ownership.
