## Overview

The AZLA Smart DAC A100 is a compact USB-C to 3.5 mm dongle DAC aimed at upgrading smartphone and laptop audio. Official information from AZLA’s Japan distributor specifies PCM support **up to 24-bit/96 kHz** with UAC 1.0 compatibility and TRRS microphone passthrough, plus a bundled USB-A adapter for broader device support [1]. Some global launch coverage and retailer listings have claimed 32-bit/384 kHz, but those claims are inconsistent with the official Japan product page and domestic announcements that state 96 kHz/24-bit as the maximum [1][3]. We therefore treat 24-bit/96 kHz as the authoritative capability for this model. The ~7 cm cable uses silver-plated OFC wiring with a woven shield and strain relief; build quality is above typical “generic” adapters. In Japan, the regular price is approximately **15 USD** via the official store network, while AZLA’s own international store lists **USD 19.00** [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There is insufficient third-party measurement data for core audio performance (THD+N, SINAD, SNR, output power into load, FR linearity). Official pages list format support and usage scope (UAC 1.0, TRRS mic) but omit quantified audio metrics. In line with our conservative handling when independent data is unavailable, we assign **0.5** to reflect that real-world fidelity cannot be validated at this time. Where possible, readers should prefer devices with documented measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A100 follows a conventional USB codec-dongle architecture with UAC 1.0 for wide compatibility (including game consoles). Materials (silver-plated conductors, woven shield) emphasize durability and cosmetics rather than unique circuit innovation or proprietary algorithms. Absent evidence of special IP or advanced implementation, the design sits below average for technological distinctiveness.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**CP (USD):** CP = 14.99 / 19.00 = 0.789 → 0.8  
Reference device: **FiiO JA11** (mic input, UAC 1.0; usual price **USD 14.99**) [4].  
A100 at **USD 19.00** [2] is priced above the **lowest-priced non-inferior alternative** (mic passthrough, ≥24-bit/96 kHz, published specs). The result is below the class floor yet still competitive given the cable build and included USB-A adapter, hence **0.8**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Support and warranty terms appear to vary by channel. AZLA distribution in Japan (aiuto) handles sales, while some retailers list differing warranty periods; Sound House indicates a short warranty window and positions the A100 as a lightweight cable-type accessory [5]. The integrated cable design can be more failure-prone than rigid-body dongles under repeated bending. Combined with limited clarity on warranty duration for cable-class accessories, we assess reliability/support below average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

AZLA’s broader catalog often emphasizes empirically grounded ergonomics (eartip lineups). For A100, the choice of UAC 1.0, TRRS mic, and short cable targets real compatibility needs. However, premium conductor materials have little proven audible benefit at the dongle’s power/SNR class versus basic robust construction. The result is a sensible, usability-first product with some marketing-driven material choices.

## Advice

If you need **USB-C to 3.5 mm with headset mic support** and plug-and-play behavior on phones/consoles, A100 is simple and affordable at **USD 19.00**. If you value **documented audio specifications and the absolute lowest price**, **FiiO JA11** offers similar functionality at a **lower official USD price** and with widely published specs; consider it first if availability is good in your region [4]. If you don’t require mic passthrough, a broader field of measured-performance dongles (often without mic) may deliver stronger objective results at similar cost.
