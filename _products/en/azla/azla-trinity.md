## Overview

The AZLA Trinity is a super-entry concept model jointly developed by AZLA and Ayuto. It features an 8mm driver, a 3-layer PU+PEEK composite diaphragm (46μm), a 10Hz–40kHz response, and Hi-Res Audio certification for analog playback. Two versions are available—standard 3.5 mm and USB‑C with an integrated DAC—both at the same price. SednaEarfit T ear tips (four sizes) and an aluminum housing are included. The USB‑C version supports up to 48 kHz/16‑bit.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Assessment is constrained by limited measurement disclosure. Nominal specifications list sensitivity at 104 dB SPL/mW, impedance at 16 Ω, and frequency range at 10 Hz–40 kHz, yet third‑party comprehensive measurements (frequency response, THD+N, SNR, crosstalk) are not confirmed. Subjective reviews are excluded from consideration. We apply the baseline 0.5 for unknown measurement cases.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The 3‑layer diaphragm structure based on ARD (Advanced Research Driver) seeks to suppress breakup modes. This is within the scope of established practice; we could not confirm patents or technical papers that substantiate unique advances. The USB‑C DAC (UAC 1.0, up to 48 kHz/16‑bit) is conventional. Price is excluded from this metric; we rate technology level at 0.4.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

For equivalent functions and measured performance, we use Moondrop CHU II as the comparison baseline due to widely published measurements. Using market prices converted to USD as of the review date, CHU II is USD 18.7 and Trinity is USD 14.7; CP = 18.7 USD ÷ 14.7 USD = 1.27, which is clamped to 1.0 by definition. Therefore cost‑performance is rated 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

AZLA is established, yet Trinity is a new model with limited long‑term reliability data. A standard warranty is provided and appears industry‑average. As an entry‑class wired earphone, specific long‑term support needs and firmware updates are not applicable.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design philosophy prioritizes delivering core functions efficiently without non‑scientific claims, which is rational. Limited measurement disclosure leaves room for improvement, but the target and implementation are appropriate for the entry segment.

## Advice

AZLA Trinity offers high value for its price point: Hi‑Res certification for analog playback, an aluminum housing, and SednaEarfit T tips are clear advantages. It is a viable option for first‑time buyers or price‑driven selections.

However, those prioritizing objective validation should note the limited measurements. For stronger measurement backing, consider Moondrop CHU II (+USD 4.0). For a more V‑shaped tuning, KZ ZSN Pro X (+USD 8.7) can be considered.

For users prioritizing cost above all and accepting some degree of risk, AZLA Trinity represents an attractive choice. However, it is strongly recommended to confirm return/exchange policies before purchase and seek opportunities for personal audition.
