## Overview

The Yamaha NS-SW300 is a front-firing 10-inch (25 cm) powered subwoofer using a PWM digital-drive high-efficiency (Class D) amplifier with a dual-feedback circuit. It features Yamaha’s Twisted Flare Port and Advanced YST II. Dimensions are approximately 13-3/4″ × 14-3/8″ × 16-1/2″ and weight is 39.7 lb. The official frequency response is 20–160 Hz, standby power is 0.3 W[1][2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Public data are mostly manufacturer specs: 20–160 Hz frequency response and 250 W output. A retailer/manufacturer spec listing clarifies the power rating as **250 W at 100 Hz, 5 Ω, 10% THD**[6][JA]. No independent CEA-2010 burst/output data or tolerance (±dB) are published for NS-SW300, so deep-bass distortion and maximum clean SPL below ~30 Hz remain unverified. This section is therefore provisional pending third-party measurements[1][3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Useful engineering touches include the Class-D PWM digital-drive amp with dual feedback and the Twisted Flare Port[2]. However, there’s no advanced DSP/app control or room EQ typical of newer designs. Driver and cabinet construction are conventional for the class.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Current U.S. shop price is **499.95 USD**[4]. The cheapest **equal-or-better** alternative with credible third-party measurements is the **RSL Speedwoofer 10E** at **339 USD** with independently verified ±3 dB to 26–200 Hz (anechoic) and published CEA-2010 output data, indicating comparable or better practical extension/output for a 10-inch sub[5][6].  
**Calculation:** 339 USD ÷ 499.95 USD = 0.678 → **0.7** (rounded to one decimal).

*(Equivalence note: both are single-box active 10″ subs with similar basic controls/connectivity; the 10E adds published measurement evidence and competitive extension/output[6]. NS-SW300 lacks equivalent third-party data.)*

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

U.S. listings state a **limited 2-year manufacturer warranty** for the NS-SW300[7]. Yamaha maintains a broad service network and general warranty information portal[8]. Being an analog (non-networked) design, there’s no expectation of firmware upgrades.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design prioritizes compact size and cost over maximum low-frequency headroom and objective transparency. Port shaping and feedback are rational choices, but absent measurement-backed claims or advanced DSP/room integration, the approach is functionally conservative.

## Advice

If you value compact footprint and brand support, the NS-SW300 remains serviceable for small/medium rooms. If **measured performance per dollar** is your priority, the RSL Speedwoofer 10E (339 USD) currently offers stronger value with published data[5][6]. If you require app control or a sealed alignment, consider options like SVS SB-1000 Pro (higher price)[9].
