rating: [3.2, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 0.6, 0.6]
price: 710
summary: "A solid, conventional 3-way floorstander. The lack of independent measurements keeps scientific validity conservative; features and build are competent for the price."

## Overview
The NS-F350 is a 3-way, bass-reflex floorstander with dual 6.5-inch woofers, a 5-inch midrange, and a 1-inch aluminum dome tweeter. It crosses at 1.4/3.8kHz, measures 220×1,157×339mm, and weighs 25.9kg per unit. Japan MSRP is 55,000円 per unit [1][2].

## Scientific Validity
$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$
No full third-party anechoic data set (on-axis/ER/DI, THD/IMD, polars) was found. Manufacturer figures include 35Hz–45kHz bandwidth (noted as **-10dB** in the owner’s manual), 88dB sensitivity, 6Ω nominal impedance, and 100W/200W power ratings; absent independent lab confirmation, we keep the score neutral [2][8].

## Technology Level
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$
A dedicated midrange in a 3-way network, curved cabinet, PMD cone diaphragms, and an aluminum dome tweeter are sensible, mainstream choices. We did not find evidence of novel engineering with published technical materials demonstrating measurable superiority over peers; thus, a moderate score [2].

## Cost-Performance
$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$
**Computed in USD for alignment.** Review target price basis: **710 USD/pair** (converted from Japan MSRP 55,000円 each). Cheapest equal-or-better comparator: **ELAC Debut 2.0 F5.2** (passive 3-way tower; catalog performance comparable) at **319 USD each = 638 USD/pair** [1][3].  
**Computation:** 638 USD ÷ 710 USD = 0.898 … → **0.9**.

## Reliability & Support
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$
No model-specific failure-rate statistics are published. Region-dependent warranty applies; Yamaha USA’s documentation includes a **2-year term for speaker systems** purchased from authorized dealers [5][6]. Standard support portals are available [7].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$
The design avoids non-scientific claims and follows established engineering practices (appropriate band-splitting, cabinet control). However, we see limited evidence of a measurement-first posture (e.g., comprehensive public measurements or polar-control focus), so we keep a mid-level score.

## Advice
If you want a steady, full-range tower for mixed movie/music use and have room to place them properly, the NS-F350 remains viable. Cross-shop **ELAC Debut 2.0 F5.2** (319 USD each) and audition in your own space; with little public third-party data, in-room validation is especially important [3].
