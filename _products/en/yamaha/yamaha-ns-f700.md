## Overview

The Yamaha NS-F700 is a three-way, bass-reflex floorstanding loudspeaker using a 16 cm woofer and 13 cm midrange with A-PMD cones plus a 3 cm aluminum-dome DC-Diaphragm tweeter. Its trapezoidal cabinet and rounded top aim to reduce standing waves, and a Piano Black finish matching Yamaha grand pianos’ appearance is available. The model is discontinued and mainly found on the used market [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs list 45 Hz–50 kHz (−10 dB) bandwidth, 6 ohm nominal impedance, 89 dB/2.83 V/m sensitivity, and 700 Hz/4 kHz crossover points [1][2]. However, no independent full measurement set (anechoic FR/THD/directivity) has been published for this model. Following the rule for unknown measured performance, we assign 0.5 pending third-party data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A-PMD cones, DC-Diaphragm tweeter, and cabinet geometry are rational choices. Still, compared with state-of-the-art waveguide/directivity optimization verified by modern measurements, the novelty is limited. Overall, this aligns with an earlier design generation rather than current best-in-class [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Reviewed item’s market price used: **811 USD/pair** (converted from 120,000円).  
**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better)**: **JBL Stage A170**, a passive 2.5-way tower with 6 ohm impedance, 89 dB sensitivity, and independently verified performance including a largely flat midband and a low-frequency **−6 dB point at 44 Hz** [3]. New units are available at **265 USD each → 530 USD/pair** [4].  
Equivalence note: user-visible functions match (passive floorstander); third-party measurements confirm neutrality/extension meeting or exceeding the NS-F700’s spec envelope [3].

Computation (USD basis):  
**530 ÷ 811 = 0.65 → 0.7 (rounded to one decimal place).**  
Used listings in Japan commonly span roughly 70,000–120,000円 per pair depending on condition [5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The model is **discontinued** and no longer covered by new-product warranty. Documentation remains online, but parts/service depend on availability via Yamaha’s service channels. Each speaker weighs 25 kg, so shipping/handling risks are non-trivial [1][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design consistently addresses known acoustic issues (cone stiffness/mass, wideband tweeter, cabinet-mode control) and is technically coherent [1][2]. Absent independent verification of transparent-level results, we keep this at a neutral 0.5.

## Advice

- Choose the NS-F700 if you value **finish/build** and want a classic three-way passive tower from Yamaha.  
- If you prioritize **measurement-backed neutrality and lower cost**, the **JBL Stage A170 (530 USD/pair, new)** is a strong alternative [3][4].  
- For larger rooms or more bass, consider a subwoofer and optimize placement/toe-in.  
- Use an amplifier comfortable with **6 ohm loads** and with adequate headroom (sensitivity 89 dB/2.83 V/m) [1].
