## Overview

The HS5 is Yamaha's entry-level powered studio monitor, featuring a 5-inch woofer and 1-inch tweeter in bi-amplified configuration with 70W total power. Released in November 2013 as part of the HS Series succeeding the legendary NS-10, it targets home studios and nearfield monitoring applications. Currently priced at 199.99 USD per unit with balanced XLR connectivity.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurements from Audio Science Review show 5.4dB cool tilt in frequency response, indicating problematic linearity [1]. THD remains below 1% in midrange with rising distortion below 100Hz, demonstrating acceptable distortion control [2]. Overall measured performance is moderate due to frequency response limitations.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The HS5 employs proprietary Advanced Magnetic Field Design and noise reduction technology achieving 6dB port noise reduction [3]. Bi-amplified design uses dedicated 45W/25W amplifiers with newly designed transducers. However, these 2013-era technologies are now established rather than cutting-edge, limiting advancement scoring.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

CP = 149 USD ÷ 199.99 USD = 0.7

Using only user-facing functions and measured performance as equivalence criteria, the JBL 305P MkII powered monitor was identified as the cheapest product with balanced professional inputs and equal-or-better measured performance. Erin's Audio Corner measurements report approximately 3.3dB frequency response deviation in the 300Hz–5kHz range and lower distortion figures than the HS5 while maintaining comparable output capability [5]. With a typical street price of about 149 USD per unit versus 199.99 USD for the HS5, the calculated cost-performance score becomes 149 USD ÷ 199.99 USD ≈ 0.7 after rounding to one decimal place.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Yamaha provides standard warranty through authorized dealers. User reports document power supply failures, amplifier circuit issues, and connection noise problems. The active two-way architecture with integrated amplifiers and MDF cabinet construction is typical for this price range, and actual reliability is determined more by quality control of electronic components and thermal design than by the bi-amplified topology itself. Parts availability exists through dealers and third-party suppliers [7].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Design emphasizes measurement-focused accuracy over subjective coloration with costs allocated toward functional improvements rather than premium materials [3]. Evolution from HS50M shows measurable improvements. However, claimed "flat response" contradicts measured midrange elevation, indicating partial marketing overstatement.

## Advice

For home studios requiring affordable professional monitoring, the HS5 represents the most cost-effective option with essential professional features. The 5.4dB frequency response deviation may compromise critical mixing accuracy. Users should implement acoustic treatment and consider room correction. For professional applications requiring highest accuracy, budget allocation toward more linear monitors may provide better value.
