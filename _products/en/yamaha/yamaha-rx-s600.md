summary: "Discontinued 2014 slim AV receiver; solid basic measurements but dated platform. No cheaper new receiver matches or beats it at this used-market price, so CP=1.0."

## Overview

The Yamaha RX-S600 is a 5.1-channel slim network AV receiver released in 2014 and now discontinued. It targets space-constrained setups with a 111 mm-tall chassis, network features (including AirPlay), and five HDMI inputs. **Manufacturer specs** list 60 W per channel into 6 ohms (20 Hz–20 kHz, 2ch, 0.09% THD) and 95 W into 6 ohms (1 kHz, 1ch, 0.9% THD), plus dynamic power of 90 W into 8 ohms [2]. Third-party bench data confirms low distortion and good crosstalk for its era [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Measured data (third-party):** THD+N < 0.026% at 1 kHz driving 2.83 V into 8 ohms; crosstalk −95.39 dB (L→R) / −98.42 dB (R→L) at 1 kHz; A-weighted SNR −106.13 dBrA (10 Hz–24 kHz) [1]. **Manufacturer specs:** frequency response 10 Hz–100 kHz (+0/−3 dB) [2]. Distortion and SNR approach or reach transparent territory, while modest power reserves limit headroom with insensitive speakers. Overall, measurements support audibly clean operation at typical listening levels, with caveats on maximum SPL.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Conventional Class-AB amplification and Burr-Brown 192 kHz/24-bit DACs were standard in 2014. HDMI and streaming capabilities are dated relative to current 4K/8K, eARC, and modern app ecosystems. YPAO room correction is basic by today’s standards. No notable innovations beyond the thin chassis and then-typical network feature set. 

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Price basis (denominator):** 250 USD (current used-market asking for this discontinued model).  
**Cheapest equal-or-better new product identified:** Pioneer VSX-534 (5.2ch, **manufacturer specs** 80 W/ch @ 8 ohms, 20 Hz–20 kHz, 2ch, 0.08% THD; modern 4K HDR HDMI), available at 279 USD from an authorized retailer on Amazon [3][4]. Despite the Pioneer’s more modern HDMI feature set and higher 8-ohm rated power, it is **not cheaper** than the RX-S600’s 250 USD market price. **No cheaper new receiver with equal-or-better functions and published performance could be confirmed**, so CP = 1.0.

*(Conditions differ: RX-S600 power is specified at 6 ohms; the VSX-534 at 8 ohms.)* [2][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The model is discontinued; official firmware development and warranty coverage have ended. Long-term parts availability and compatibility with current HDMI ecosystems are uncertain. For buyers needing ongoing updates or service, a current-production receiver is the safer choice.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The thin chassis solves real installation constraints, but prioritizing compactness limits thermal and power headroom. Absent advances in room correction or signal processing, the approach does not push toward today’s transparent-level performance metrics or modern connectivity.

## Advice

Avoid purchasing the RX-S600 unless the compact 111 mm height is essential and you accept end-of-life trade-offs. If you only need a basic 5.x HDMI AVR and want current support, a new entry model like the Pioneer VSX-534 provides up-to-date connectivity and at-least-comparable rated performance (though at a higher price). If you specifically require a slim AVR with current HDMI features, be aware that modern slim units (e.g., Marantz slim series) tend to be significantly more expensive than the RX-S600’s used-market price.
