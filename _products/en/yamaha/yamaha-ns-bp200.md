## Overview

The Yamaha NS-BP200 is a 2-way bass reflex bookshelf speaker developed by Yamaha. It features a 12cm cone woofer and 3cm soft dome tweeter, with 55Hz-28kHz (-10dB) frequency response and 85dB sensitivity in a compact design. The piano black high-gloss cabinet finish adopts a design approach conscious of living room installation. This product is positioned as an application of acoustic technology cultivated through Yamaha's musical instrument manufacturing to consumer speakers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The measured performance of the NS-BP200 reveals several issues when viewed against modern transparency level standards. The 85dB sensitivity is classified as low sensitivity by current standards, requiring significant amplifier output to achieve adequate sound pressure levels. The 55Hz-28kHz (-10dB) frequency response has limitations in low-frequency reproduction below 55Hz, restricting full-range playback capability. While the 6Ω design is common, it cannot be considered optimized for amplifier matching. Due to lack of published detailed measurement data for crosstalk, S/N ratio, and harmonic distortion, questions remain regarding achieving transparency-level sound quality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Technically, this adopts industry-standard approaches. The 2-way configuration and bass reflex design are established technologies with limited uniqueness or innovation. The 4.5kHz crossover frequency setting is within reasonable range, but no notable technical innovations are evident for modern speaker design. In cabinet design, volume securing through deep proportions is rational, but investment of latest technologies in resonance suppression or internal loss is not confirmed. The driver units also have generic configurations, and Yamaha's unique technological advantages are not clear.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Against the current market price of 81 USD, comparison with equivalent passive bookshelf speakers shows no cheaper alternatives with equivalent or superior measured performance. Therefore, the review target is positioned as the most affordable option in the same category. While price advantages are highly recognized, evaluation considers absolute measured performance as limited.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Basic reliability as a Yamaha brand product is secured, with repair support systems established domestically and internationally. The warranty period is industry-standard one year with no notable long-term warranty. While specific failure rate data is not published, no major quality issues have been confirmed for Yamaha consumer audio products. However, due to the passive speaker product characteristics, continuous support such as firmware updates is not applicable. This represents average support levels for consumer products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design approach is conservative, based on established acoustic engineering methods. Bass reflex design for low-frequency extension and 2-way configuration for cost reduction and compactness are rational. However, the 85dB low sensitivity design is not necessarily optimal considering modern amplifier circumstances. Additionally, non-disclosure of detailed measurement data is insufficient for modern product design emphasizing scientific approaches. While living room compatibility in design aspects is appreciated, clear approaches to achieving scientific transparency levels in sound quality are not confirmed. Non-magnetic shielding design is also common in modern times and cannot be considered special consideration.

## Advice

The NS-BP200 is positioned as an option when seeking Yamaha brand bookshelf speakers within limited budgets. However, expectations regarding sound quality need to be appropriately set. Due to 85dB low sensitivity, amplifier output of 50W or more is recommended to achieve sufficient volume. Since frequencies below 55Hz are not reproduced, considering combination with a subwoofer is important. For applications without high sound quality requirements such as background music playback in living rooms, it provides acceptable performance. However, it is not suitable for critical listening or music production purposes. When seeking higher performance products in the same price range, strong consideration including overseas manufacturer products is highly recommended.
