summary: "Professional passive PA speaker with a straightforward 2-way design and solid build. Lacks third-party measurements and DSP conveniences but remains cost-effective when no cheaper equivalent-or-better passive 15-inch option exists."

## Overview

The Yamaha CBR15 is a passive 2-way, bass-reflex 15-inch loudspeaker intended for FOH, DJ, and install use. It pairs a 15" LF driver (2.5" voice coil) with a compression driver using a 1.4" voice coil on a 90°×60° horn; the network crosses at 2.0 kHz. Manufacturer specs state frequency range (−10 dB) 46 Hz–20 kHz, sensitivity 96 dB (1 W/1 m), and peak (calculated) SPL 126 dB. The cabinet is plastic, 39.0 lb, with NL4 speakON and 1/4" inputs and a 50° wedge angle for floor monitoring. All figures in this paragraph are manufacturer specifications. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent third-party acoustic measurements (e.g., full on/off-axis FR traces, THD vs. level) for CBR15 are not readily available. We therefore rely on the maker’s stated data: 46 Hz–20 kHz (−10 dB), 96 dB sensitivity (1 W/1 m), nominal coverage 90°×60°, and peak (calculated) SPL 126 dB. Lacking verifiable third-party test conditions, this remains a provisional, mid-score assessment pending independent lab data. [1][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This is a conventional, no-DSP passive 2-way. The components and topology (ferrite LF, compression HF, 2.0 kHz crossover, constant-directivity horn, HF protection) are standard for the class and do not exhibit novel acoustic or materials engineering beyond typical implementation. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market price at review: **375.99 USD** (street). Among passive 15" two-way speakers with **equivalent-or-better user-visible functions** and **spec-level performance**, the lowest-priced candidate we could confirm is JBL’s JRX215; however its current US price is **399 USD**, i.e., higher than the CBR15. Therefore, as of this writing, we did not find a cheaper product meeting equivalence; CP is set to **1.0**. (Equivalence note: JRX215 matches the function set and lists sensitivity 99 dB, maximum SPL 129 dB, and 41–18 kHz (−10 dB), satisfying the “equal-or-better” threshold on key axes by catalog spec.) [4][5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Yamaha specifies a **3-year warranty** in the US/Canada for CBR-series passive loudspeakers. The ABS enclosure, steel grille, and HF protection circuit are practical reliability choices; passive architecture also removes common powered-box failure points (amplifier module/PSU). Global service coverage is mature, but the plastic enclosure and mid-tier build place long-term robustness at a solid—yet not exceptional—level. [1][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product is utilitarian: money goes to drivers, a sensible horn, and a cabinet that supports main/monitor duties (50° wedge), with no marketing-heavy adornments. The trade-off is reliance on outboard amplification/DSP. Overall it’s a rational, purpose-driven design rather than an ambition to push state-of-the-art. [1][2]

## Advice

Choose the CBR15 when you specifically need **passive** mains/monitors and already own appropriate amplifiers/DSP. If you want simpler rigs or features like built-in limiting/EQ, consider powered alternatives. For purely price-driven passive 15" choices, note that commonly cited competitors with comparable spec performance in the US (e.g., JBL JRX215) are **not** cheaper at the time of review; in that scenario, the CBR15 is an efficient buy.
