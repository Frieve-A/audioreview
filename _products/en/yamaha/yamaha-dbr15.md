## Overview

Yamaha DBR15 is a bi-amped 15-inch powered PA designed for output and portability. Manufacturer specs state **132 dB peak SPL**, **50 Hz–20 kHz (-10 dB)** bandwidth, **FIR-X 2.1 kHz** crossover, and **90°×60°** coverage, with D-CONTOUR/HPF and a basic 2-in mixer for FOH or monitor use [1][2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent full-range lab FR/THD data are scarce; therefore we lean on clearly documented **manufacturer specifications** (SPL, bandwidth, crossover, coverage) and a reputable review noting clean behavior at high levels. Provisional until third-party data appear; specs are internally consistent across Yamaha materials [1][3][4].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Solid, industry-standard implementation: Class-D bi-amp with FIR-X linear-phase filtering and sensible protection/limiters; no networked control or app. Competent rather than cutting-edge [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Target price: **549 USD** [5]. We searched for **equal-or-better** 15-inch powered tops (user-visible functions comparable, **≥132 dB peak SPL**). Examples: **EV ELX200-15P** (132 dB) and **Turbosound iQ15** (132 dB) meet the performance bar but are **costlier** in current market listings [8][9][10]. **JBL EON715** adds Bluetooth/app yet is **128 dB**, thus not equivalent in output [7]. Since **no cheaper equivalent** exists, CP is clamped to **1.0** per the rule. Short equivalence note: *bi-amped Class-D, comparable DSP, and manufacturer-rated 132 dB peak SPL* [7][8][10].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

North America offers a **long 7-year warranty** on Yamaha Professional Audio loudspeakers and broad service coverage—strong indicators for long-term support [6].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Design prioritizes high usable SPL, straightforward deployment (D-CONTOUR/HPF), and portability over expanded feature sets. Choices are coherent for gigging FOH or wedge roles [1][2].

## Advice

If you require **Bluetooth/app control**, consider **JBL EON715** (but lower max SPL at 128 dB) [7]. If you want **similar SPL with deeper onboard DSP**, look at **EV ELX200-15P** or **Turbosound iQ15**—both meet 132 dB but typically cost more [8][9][10].
