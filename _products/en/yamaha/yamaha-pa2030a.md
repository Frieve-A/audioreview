## Overview

The Yamaha PA2030A is a compact 1U half-rack Class-D installation power amplifier aimed at retail, education, and public facilities. It can operate either as 30W × 2 into low-impedance loads (3Ω/4Ω/8Ω) or as a single-channel 60W constant-voltage amplifier for 70V/100V distributed systems, and includes multiple protection functions for continuous duty. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer-published measurements indicate THD+N ≤0.1% at 1kHz, 15W into 3/4Ω (Lo-Z) and ≤0.2% at 1kHz, 30W in 70V/100V mode. Frequency response is 50Hz–20kHz (−3/+1dB, 1W, 3/4Ω) and 90Hz–20kHz (−3/+1dB, 1W, 70V/100V). Crosstalk is specified at ≤−70dB. No SNR spec is published and credible third-party bench data were not found at review time, so results remain based on manufacturer data. These figures are adequate for BGM/paging; the 70V high-pass and modest power keep it below transparent hi-fi thresholds. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PA2030A employs a conventional Class-D output stage with switch-mode PSU and practical install features (Lo-Z/Hi-Z switchability, speaker EQ/filters for Yamaha VXC/VXS lines, and layered protection). The design is competent but not novel—no advanced proprietary amplification or integrated networked DSP that would move it beyond industry standard practice. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**US market price:** 339.99 USD (typical street/MAP). [2][3]  
We searched for the **cheapest equal-or-better** product (user-visible functions: 60W 70V/100V constant-voltage output suitable for distributed systems; measured performance at least comparable on THD+N and frequency response).

- **Crown 160MA (60W 70V/100V mixer-amp):** FR 50Hz–20kHz, THD+N <0.5% at rated power (0.1% @5W). Typically priced above PA2030A. *Measured distortion is worse at rated power*, so not equal-or-better. [4]
- **AtlasIED PA60G (60W 70V/100V power amp):** FR 50Hz–20kHz, THD+N ≤0.5% @1kHz; common street price ~472.99 USD—**more expensive and higher THD**. [5]
- **JBL VMA/CSMA 60-W class:** 70V/100V FR typically 80Hz–15kHz or 20kHz with THD <0.5%; street prices generally higher than PA2030A—**not cheaper and not lower THD**. [6]

Cheaper PA mixer-amps like **Pyle PCM30A** exist, but they are **not equivalent**: FR 50Hz–15kHz and THD <1%, plus lower output and different functional profile; thus they cannot be used as the CP comparator. [7][8]

Given the absence of any cheaper product with **equal-or-better** user-visible functions and specs, **CP = 1.0** by definition (the review target is the cheapest among equal-or-better options). Do not present a numeric division when CP=1.0. [Section rules]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Yamaha offers broad global service coverage and warranty support for commercial audio. The PA2030A lists thermal/overcurrent/DC/protection layers and conventional convection cooling, which is appropriate for quiet, enclosed installs. Specific MTBF data is not published, but Yamaha’s pro install track record supports an above-average reliability expectation. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The product’s direction is rational for real-world installs: efficient Class-D topology, Lo-Z/Hi-Z flexibility, compact fanless chassis, and protective limiters aligned with continuous BGM/paging. It avoids marketing-driven “audiophile” claims and focuses on measurable, installation-relevant traits. Pricing aligns competitively with peers that meet or exceed its published performance. [1][2][4][5]

## Advice

Choose the PA2030A when you need a compact, quiet, **Lo-Z/Hi-Z switchable** amp with credible published distortion/response figures and dependable support. For pure 70V/100V use, alternatives exist, but those found to be cheaper generally carry higher THD or narrower bandwidth; equal-spec peers tend to cost more. If your application demands wider low-frequency bandwidth at 70V or integrated networked DSP, consider stepping up to higher-tier commercial amps and budget accordingly. [4][5][6]
