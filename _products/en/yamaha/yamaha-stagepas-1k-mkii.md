## Overview

The Yamaha StagePas 1K MkII is an all-in-one portable column PA comprising a 12-inch subwoofer and a 10×1.5-inch slim line array reaching 2,000 mm assembled height. It uses Class-D amplification rated at 1100 W, is specified at **125 dB SPL (peak, 1 m)** with **170° (H) × 30° (V)** coverage, a **240 Hz** crossover, and **37 Hz–20 kHz (−10 dB)** frequency range[1]. The integrated **5-channel digital mixer** adds SPX reverbs, one-knob EQ, a master MODE compressor, and Bluetooth audio input[1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, lab-style measurements (e.g., THD vs SPL, gated on-axis FR with ±dB tolerance, S/N) remain scarce; assessment relies mainly on manufacturer specifications (125 dB SPL, 37 Hz–20 kHz, 240 Hz crossover)[1]. A third-party review notes **audible strain past ~105 dB** as a listening observation without controlled test details[2]. Given the limited reproducible data, we assign **0.5** pending future third-party measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A J-curve 10-driver array over a 12-inch sub with onboard DSP (1-knob EQ, MODE, SPX reverbs) is competent contemporary engineering for uniform coverage and quick setup[1]. No measurement-driven breakthrough is evident, so we keep a mid-tier score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

We standardize CP in **USD**. The cheapest **equivalent-or-better** alternative is **RCF EVOX J8** (column/sub, **128 dB max SPL**), normalized with a **Yamaha MG10XU** mixer to match mic inputs and FX[4][5][6]. Typical US pricing: EVOX J8 **999 USD** and MG10XU **289.99 USD**; StagePas 1K MkII typical market price **1,449.99 USD** (ignoring temporary promotions)[5][6][7][8].  
**CP = (999 + 289.99) ÷ 1,449.99 = 0.889… ≈ 0.9.**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Yamaha provides official support channels and warranty information; however, objective durability statistics (e.g., MTBF) are not published[1]. We keep a neutral 0.5.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This model is **purpose-built for small/medium venues**, emphasizing **fast setup and error-resistant operation** via an integrated mixer, **one-knob EQ/SPX/Ducker**, and **remote app control**[1]. The **170°×30° coverage** targets consistent audience experience with minimal gear; the MKII iteration adds **higher SPL and improved remote functionality** over the prior version[2]. The design is cohesive for its use case, warranting a slightly-above-neutral score.

## Advice

Choose StagePas 1K MkII if you value **setup speed** and **integrated mixing/DSP** with predictable coverage. If you need **more headroom per dollar**, consider **RCF EVOX J8 + Yamaha MG10XU**: combined **1,288.99 USD** versus **1,449.99 USD** for the StagePas, with higher stated max SPL[4][5][6][7][8]. The trade-off is extra cabling and a separate mixer.
