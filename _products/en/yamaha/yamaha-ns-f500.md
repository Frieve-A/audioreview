## Overview

The Yamaha NS-F500 is a 3-way, bass-reflex floorstanding speaker first announced on August 26, 2010 and released in early October 2010 in Japan. Yamaha lists it as a completed item on the current Japanese site, with original MSRP noted there; the model is no longer in production. Key design elements include a DC-Diaphragm™ 3 cm aluminum tweeter (voice coil wound directly on the diaphragm), A-PMD cones for the 13 cm mid and 16 cm woofer, aluminum die-cast baskets, square woofer voice coil, and a Soavo-style cabinet with three-way mitered joints and extensive internal bracing.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Official specifications (per unit, passive): frequency response 40 Hz–50 kHz, sensitivity 88 dB (2.83 V/1 m), impedance 6 Ω, nominal input 40 W / max 160 W, crossover 580 Hz and 4.1 kHz, 19.1 kg. We did not find credible third-party Klippel/anechoic datasets for this model; therefore audible fidelity beyond catalog specs remains unverified and provisionally evaluated.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This section evaluates **technology itself**, not data disclosure. The NS-F500 implements several concrete engineering choices:

- **DC-Diaphragm™ tweeter:** the voice coil is directly wound on an aluminum-magnesium diaphragm, reducing adhesive interfaces and potential mechanical losses, aiming at extended HF and fine detail retrieval.
- **A-PMD cones and solid rubber surrounds** for mid/woofer: a light but stiff cone recipe targeting controlled breakup and stable pistonic behavior.
- **Square woofer voice coil** for increased surface area and space factor versus round coils, improving motor efficiency at a given gap size.
- **Aluminum die-cast baskets** for the 13 cm mid and 16 cm woofer to maintain motor/basket rigidity under load.
- **Soavo-inspired cabinet** using three-way mitered joints, slanted partitions, and ladder bracing to suppress panel resonance; supplied with tuned spikes.

These are legitimate, mainstream acoustic engineering measures for a passive 3-way tower. There is no DSP, waveguide-controlled directivity, or cardioid/active bass system, but within a conventional architecture the implementation is technically coherent and moderately sophisticated.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Reviewed price (current used market, pair):** **USD 600**.

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (pair):** **Sony SS-CS3**—a current 3-way passive tower with comparable user-facing functions (3-way, similar sensitivity/impedance) and publicly available Klippel NFS data indicating competent linearity. Typical new street pricing is **USD 137.99 each** at a major US retailer (**USD 275.98 per pair**).

**Equivalence note (user perspective):** both are passive 3-way towers with similar basic catalog specs; SS-CS3 additionally has independent NFS data indicating controlled FR deviation, so it is judged **equal-or-better** for CP purposes.

**CP calculation:** **275.98 USD ÷ 600 USD = 0.46 → score 0.5** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Evaluation focuses on **warranty/repair systems and typical serviceability** for a passive loudspeaker. As a passive design there is no firmware/software domain. Yamaha provides manuals and product pages remain accessible; repair pathways generally rely on part availability via Yamaha’s service channels or third-party parts/repair for legacy models. No field-wide systemic failure pattern is documented in reliable sources. In the absence of RMA/MTBF data, we assign a neutral, average-level score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independently of measured outcomes, the **development direction** is rational for a conventional passive tower: reducing moving-system losses (DC-Diaphragm), increasing motor efficiency (square voice coil), stiffening the mechanical structure (die-cast baskets, braced/mitered cabinet), and controlling resonance. These choices plausibly contribute to measurable improvements (FR smoothness, breakup control, lower parasitic resonances) without resorting to non-scientific claims.

## Advice

If you want a **current, inexpensive tower with documented measurements**, the **Sony SS-CS3** is a strong baseline. If you prefer a **current Yamaha tower with active support** (2-way), **NS-F150** is the brand-consistent option. For higher confidence in neutrality and directivity control, prioritize models with complete spin data or equivalent anechoic measurement sets.
