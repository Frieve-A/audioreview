## Overview

The Yamaha NS-B330 is a 2-way bass-reflex passive bookshelf speaker using a 13 cm cone woofer and 3 cm aluminum-dome tweeter with a small waveguide. Yamaha advertises 55 Hz–45 kHz bandwidth and 87 dB sensitivity at 6 ohms (manufacturer specs) and highlights a tweeter waveguide and “Hi-Res” compatibility [1][2]. Independent lab measurements (spinorama, distortion, compression) for this exact model could not be found from credible sources, so the review below is provisional and grounded in manufacturer documentation plus comparisons to measured alternatives.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are no credible third-party measurements (CTA-2034/SPIN, on-axis FR, harmonic distortion) for NS-B330. Only catalog specs are available: frequency response 55 Hz–45 kHz, sensitivity 87 dB/2.83 V/1 m, impedance 6 ohms (manufacturer) [1]. The advertised 45 kHz (–10 dB) ultrasonic extension is inaudible to humans and does not evidence audible fidelity gains [1][2]. In line with our policy for “measurement unknown,” the baseline score is set to 0.5 pending reliable lab data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Design is conventional for this category: 2-way, bass-reflex, a small tweeter waveguide, polymer cone woofer and aluminum dome tweeter. Yamaha cites a waveguide to manage tweeter directivity, but provides no engineering details (e.g., directivity indexes, crossover topology with slopes) and there are no linked white papers or patents for this model [1][2]. Absent demonstrated innovations or validated performance gains, sophistication appears modest.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Using market pricing for equivalence: NS-B330 at roughly **350 USD/pair** (converted from the Japan MSRP **50,600 円/pair**) [3]. The **cheapest equal-or-better alternative with verified measurements** we could confirm is **Emotiva Airmotiv B1+** at **229 USD/pair** on Emotiva’s catalog page [5], with independent Klippel NFS/SPIN data from Erin’s Audio Corner [4].  
**CP calculation:** 229 USD ÷ 350 USD = **0.65** → rounded to **0.7**.  
*Equivalence note:* both are passive 2-way bookshelf speakers; B1+ has published response/directivity and distortion data [4], satisfying “equal-or-better measured performance” relative to the unmeasured NS-B330.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Yamaha provides mature global support. However, the **NS-B330 is marked “Discontinued”** on Yamaha’s regional site, which may limit future new-stock availability and some parts access [2]. Being a passive design, there is no software lifecycle to consider. Net: slightly above average thanks to Yamaha’s network, tempered by the discontinuation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product messaging emphasizes ultrasonic extension to 45 kHz (–10 dB) and “Hi-Res” compatibility [1][2]. These do not translate into proven audible benefits; rational improvements would target demonstrably audible domains (20 Hz–20 kHz linearity, controlled directivity, low distortion, consistent QC). Given the marketing focus versus the absence of evidence for audible-range optimizations, we assign a low score.

## Advice

If you value **measured transparency**, choose models with published CTA-2034/SPIN and distortion/compression data. The **Emotiva Airmotiv B1+ (229 USD/pair)** is well-documented and cheaper [4][5]. If you want a larger cone area with similarly documented data, the **ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2** is widely measured; a representative current US street price is about **329 USD/pair** [6][7]. With NS-B330 discontinued and lacking third-party data, these measured alternatives are easier to recommend.
