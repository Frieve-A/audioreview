## Overview

The Yamaha NS-SW050 is an 8-inch powered subwoofer featuring Advanced YST II and a Twisted Flare Port. It is specified at **28–200 Hz** with **50 W continuous output** (Yamaha lists **100 Hz, 5 Ω, 10% THD** conditions) and **100 W peak-equivalent**［**1**］. The feature set (YST II / Twisted Flare Port) is documented on Yamaha’s official overview page［**2**］. A representative US market price is **199.95 USD**［**3**］.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Public, third-party measurements (max SPL, –3 dB extension, distortion vs. output) are not readily available. Based on manufacturer specs—**28–200 Hz** bandwidth and **50 W continuous** with a **10% THD rating condition** at the power spec［**1**］—clean headroom is likely limited in larger rooms. With key metrics unverified by independent tests, the score remains at the baseline **0.5**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A conventional discrete amplifier and ported enclosure augmented by YST II and a flared port are sensible but not cutting-edge versus modern DSP-driven subs［**1**］［**2**］. For its class the design is solid, yet technological novelty is modest.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Using **199.95 USD** as the NS-SW050’s representative price［**3**］, the **cheapest equal-or-better** comparator now is **Sony SA-CS9** (10", **28–200 Hz** spec)［**5**］ at **119.99 USD** on Sony’s store as of today［**6**］.  
**CP = 119.99 USD ÷ 199.95 USD = 0.60 → 0.6**.  
The SA-CS9 matches the claimed low-frequency extension (28 Hz) and adds a larger driver and higher power on paper, thus qualifying as **equal-or-better** in key aspects at a lower price［**5**］［**6**］.

> Note: A previously cited Monoprice 8" alternative is currently **199 USD** and publishes a higher low-end cutoff, so it is neither cheaper nor superior by spec［**4**］.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Expect average reliability for a mass-market model from a major brand. A US retailer lists a **limited 2-year manufacturer warranty** for this unit［**3**］, and Yamaha provides product support and warranty information pages［**1**］.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design aims for “easy, rich bass” using YST II and a low-noise port—reasonable choices for entry-level use［**2**］. However, the **50 W continuous** rating and the **10% THD** condition tied to the power spec［**1**］indicate compromises that prioritize affordability and compactness over high output and ultra-low distortion.

## Advice

For **small to medium rooms** and first-time subwoofer buyers, the NS-SW050 is easy to place and integrates smoothly for basic bass fill. If you want the **best value at this price**, the **Sony SA-CS9** presently undercuts it while matching or exceeding the headline specs, and is worth shortlisting［**5**］［**6**］.
