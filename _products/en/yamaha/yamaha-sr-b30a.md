summary: "The YAMAHA SR-B30A is an entry-class soundbar offering Dolby Atmos support for 24,389 yen. Priced approximately 4,600 yen below its competitor, the DENON DHT-S218 (around 29,000 yen), it boasts the highest cost-performance for a product with this feature. Its spatial representation via angled upward-firing speakers is also excellent, proving particularly effective for movie viewing. However, its mid-high frequency resolution for music reproduction shows limitations inherent to its price point."

## Overview

The YAMAHA SR-B30A is an entry-class Dolby Atmos-compatible soundbar released in 2023. It features a total 120W output configuration with 4.6cm cones×4, 2.5cm domes×2, and 7.5cm subwoofers×2, adopting distinctive angled upward speaker arrangement. At 24,389 yen, it achieves Dolby Atmos virtual surround with four sound modes (Stereo, Standard, Movie, Game) and Clear Voice functionality. Equalizer adjustment via app is also possible, providing practical features despite its entry-class positioning.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The SR-B30A's scientific validity is good. Measurements using calibration software and dummy head microphones recorded excellent results with spatial volume variance of left-right 1.9dB, up-down 2.3dB, front-back 1.88dB, averaging 2.03dB. This objectively demonstrates superior performance in spatial representation uniformity. The angled upward speaker arrangement represents rational design for directing sound toward user's ears even when installation position is low. Dolby Atmos virtual surround implementation is also at appropriate levels for this price range. However, limitations compared to physical ceiling speakers remain.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Technical sophistication is moderate. The angled upward speaker arrangement shows ingenuity in YAMAHA's acoustic design approach. Total 120W output distribution (60W front, 60W subwoofer) is appropriate for soundbars of this size. Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital Plus support represents technically correct implementation. App-based equalizer adjustment and Clear Voice functionality are also practical. However, this essentially represents combination of industry-standard technologies without innovative proprietary technology. While sufficient technical standards for entry-class, constraints exist compared to higher-end classes.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Cost-performance is rated highest. The SR-B30A's price of 24,389 yen makes it one of the most affordable options on the market for a Dolby Atmos-compatible soundbar. Considering its competitor, the DENON DHT-S218, sells for around 29,000 yen, the SR-B30A has a clear price advantage of about 4,600 yen. It does not fall short in spatial representation capabilities based on measurement data or in low-frequency performance for movies, and it offers basic features at a comparable level, making its value in this price range outstanding.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Reliability and support systems are high-standard. YAMAHA, with over 135 years of history as musical instrument and audio equipment manufacturer, has established reputation for product quality control. In the soundbar market, it's steadily expanding market share with well-organized technical support systems. Despite lightweight design at 3.9kg, user reviews show few reports of operational stability issues. Firmware updates via dedicated app are supported, enabling expectations for long-term support. However, warranty period remains at standard 1-year duration.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The rationality of the design philosophy is somewhat low. While the angled upward speaker arrangement shows some effectiveness, it fundamentally represents a technical workaround to compensate for the physical limitations of a one-body configuration. Dolby Atmos virtual surround processing is also a compromise that cannot achieve a true three-dimensional soundstage. While the price constraints for an entry-class model are understandable, a system configuration that allows for the separate purchase of rear speakers or a subwoofer may ultimately be superior in terms of both sound quality improvement and cost-performance. It relies heavily on software functions like app control, with limited fundamental approaches to sound quality improvement on the hardware side.

## Advice

When considering the purchase of the SR-B30A, it is important to clarify its primary use. If you prioritize powerful bass for movies and games, it is a cost-effective choice, being about 4,600 yen cheaper than the competing DENON DHT-S218 while providing equivalent or better effects. However, if you emphasize clarity in music reproduction and mid-high frequency resolution, the DHT-S218 may be more suitable. As an entry-class soundbar, it offers sufficient performance for users seeking a clear upgrade from their TV's built-in speakers. If you are considering expanding to a full home theater system in the future, it is recommended to consider a separate-type system from the beginning. While high ratings on Price.com are a good reference, actual listening tests in your own environment should be prioritized if possible.
