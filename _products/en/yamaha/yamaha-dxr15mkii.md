## Overview

The Yamaha DXR15MKII is a 15-inch, bi-amped powered loudspeaker aimed at portable PA and stage-monitor duties. It delivers **134 dB** peak SPL (1 m, on-axis), covers **49 Hz–20 kHz** (-10 dB), and uses a **48-bit DSP** platform with Yamaha's **FIR-X** linear-phase crossover and **D-Contour** multiband dynamics. The enclosure provides **90°×60°** coverage, integrated pole mount (0°/7°), and weighs **21.8 kg**. All figures above are manufacturer specifications. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, lab-grade measurements for THD/IMD, on-axis FR deviation, directivity index, and long-term power compression were not found at the time of review. As such, we rely on manufacturer data: **134 dB** peak SPL, **49 Hz–20 kHz** range (-10 dB), **1100 W** dynamic power split **950 W LF / 150 W HF**, and **90°×60°** nominal directivity. These suggest competent performance for its class, but without third-party verification we keep the score at the policy default and will revise if credible measurements emerge. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

DXR15MKII implements **linear-phase FIR-X** crossovering (time-alignment and phase management), **48-bit DSP**, and **D-Contour** program-dependent dynamics to preserve tonal balance with output level changes. The bi-amped Class-D module (1100 W dynamic) and enclosure/mounting options reflect mature but still modern PA engineering. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Cheapest equal-or-better alternative found: **JBL PRX815W**—a 15" powered PA with **137 dB** max SPL and Wi-Fi app control (PRX800W series). Street price observed at **899.99 USD** new. [3][4]  
Review target price: **995.99 USD**. [2]

**Calculation:** 899.99 USD ÷ 995.99 USD = 0.9036 → **0.9** (rounded to one decimal per policy).

*Equivalence note:* PRX815W matches core functionality (powered 15", onboard DSP, pro I/O) and is **equal-or-better** on claimed max SPL (137 dB ≥ 134 dB). [1][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Yamaha maintains extensive global pro-audio service networks. The DXR enclosure (molded ABS), integrated mounting, and conservative protection/DSP design align with portable/touring use. Warranty terms vary by region; typical coverage is around two years for powered speakers (confirm locally). Given Yamaha's track record and parts availability, long-term support prospects are good. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The engineering prioritizes measurable outcomes—phase-coherent crossover behavior (**FIR-X**), program-adaptive dynamics (**D-Contour**), and controlled directivity (**90°×60°**). These choices are technically sound for maximizing intelligibility and maintaining tonal balance at high output without resorting to subjective voicing. [1]

## Advice

DXR15MKII suits users who need high output, reliable protection/DSP, and straightforward analog I/O with minimal setup. If you value wireless/system-level app control and the highest claimed SPL per dollar, shortlist **JBL PRX815W** as a strong price/performance foil. If you prefer Yamaha's ecosystem and consistent voicing with DXS subs, the DXR15MKII remains a safe, field-proven pick. [1][3][4]
