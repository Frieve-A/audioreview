## Overview

The Yamaha THR10II is a 20-watt stereo desktop guitar amplifier that uses Yamaha's Virtual Circuitry Modeling (VCM) and adds Bluetooth audio/control plus a USB audio interface. It drives two 3.1-inch (8 cm) full-range speakers and measures 368 × 183 × 140 mm at 3.0 kg. This non-wireless model does **not** include a built-in battery; wireless/battery capability is reserved for the THR10II Wireless variant. Connections include 1/4" input, stereo mini AUX/PHONES, DC in, and USB (USB Audio Class 2.0). [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There is no published third-party suite of bench measurements (THD+N, SNR, linearity, FR vs. level) for the THR10II, so we start from the policy default and adjust conservatively. What we can verify: rated output 20 W (10 W + 10 W), two 3.1" drivers, 24-bit A/D (+3-bit floating) and 24-bit D/A with **48 kHz** sampling over USB, and Bluetooth **4.2** (A2DP, SBC). These are competent, modern specs for a compact modeling amp/interface but do not demonstrate transparent playback to a master. Accordingly, the scientific validity remains average pending comprehensive independent measurements. [1][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

THR10II integrates VCM amp/cab/effect modeling (15 guitar models plus acoustic/bass/flat voicings), Bluetooth audio/MIDI control via the THR Remote app, five on-unit user memories, and Yamaha's "Extended Stereo" processing for wider sound from a small enclosure. USB class-compliant I/O simplifies computer connectivity. Overall execution is solid and refined rather than bleeding-edge. [1][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Representative street price for THR10II in the U.S. is **369.99 USD**. [4][5]  
The cheapest **equivalent-or-better** alternative we could verify is the **Positive Grid Spark 40**, which offers modeling with deep app control, Bluetooth audio, and a built-in USB recording interface (with higher 40 W output) at **249 USD**. [6][7]  
Using these verified prices yields a cost-performance score of **0.7** for the THR10II.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Yamaha's build quality and service network are strong for this category, and the THR line has a long track record. In the U.S., THR guitar amplifiers carry a **1-year** limited warranty (regional terms may vary). [8]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The "third-amp" concept is coherent: desktop-friendly power, stereo playback, and integrated modeling/effects for practice and home recording. Extended Stereo enhances perceived width for both guitar and streamed audio. Trade-offs include intentionally colored response (it's an instrument amp) and the absence of a line-out on the non-wireless model. [1][3]

## Advice

If you want a compact, great-sounding practice/recording rig that doubles as a Bluetooth speaker and simple USB interface, the THR10II delivers with minimal setup. If budget takes priority and you want more power and app-centric features, the Spark 40 is the value pick at a substantially lower verified price. [6][7]
