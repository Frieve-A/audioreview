## Overview

The Yamaha RX-A4A is a 7.2-channel AV receiver from the AVENTAGE series. It features an ESS SABRE ES9007S Premier Audio DAC and is equipped with 7 inputs and 3 outputs of 8K/4K120Hz compatible HDMI 2.1 terminals. It delivers 110W per channel (8ฮฉ, 20Hz-20kHz, 2-channel driven, 0.06% THD) and supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. The unit incorporates 64-bit high-precision processing with Qualcomm QCS407 and automatic sound field correction via YPAO R.S.C., while also enabling multi-room playback through MusicCast compatibility.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The RX-A4A achieves a high standard in measurement performance. Its THD of 0.06% is close to the transparent level (0.01% or below) and is an excellent value, far below the problematic level (0.1% or above). In third-party measurements, it records a SINAD (Signal-to-Noise and Distortion Ratio) of around 98dB, demonstrating excellent performance on par with major competitors. The 120dB dynamic range from the ESS SABRE ES9007S DAC exceeds the transparent level (105dB or above), and the signal-to-noise ratio is also sufficiently high. Distortion and noise within the audible range are practically a non-issue. However, it does not reach the industry's highest measurement performance, thus not receiving a perfect score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ESS SABRE ES9007S Premier Audio DAC is a high-performance chip that surpasses industry standards. The 64-bit high-precision processing by Qualcomm QCS407 provides ample computational power, and the 3D multi-point measurement of YPAO R.S.C. is advanced compared to the correction features found in competing products in the same price range. The Anti-Resonance Technology (A.R.T.) Wedge also contributes to improved measurement results. However, similar component technologies are adopted by other manufacturers, so they cannot be considered uniquely innovative to Yamaha. While above the industry average, it does not reach the level of top-tier proprietary design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Against the RX-A4A's current price of 137,500 JPY, competing products with equivalent measurement performance and basic features are available at a significantly lower price. For example, the Denon AVR-S760H is available for a market price of 66,000 JPY. The AVR-S760H offers 7.2 channels, 8K support, Dolby Atmos/DTS:X, and has comparable core measurement performance. While the RX-A4A has advantages in features like sound field correction, the AVR-S760H fulfills the essential user functions. The cost-performance calculation is: 66,000 JPY รท 137,500 JPY = 0.48, which rounds to a score of 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Yamaha has a long history as a manufacturer of audio equipment and has established a solid position in the AV receiver market. Its product failure rates are below the industry average, and its domestic support system is well-established. The 3-year product warranty is more generous than the industry standard, and repair services are prompt. Firmware updates are provided regularly, with appropriate new features and bug fixes. However, since some manufacturers offer industry-leading support (e.g., 5-year warranties), it does not receive a perfect score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design of the RX-A4A adopts a scientifically rational approach. The use of an ESS SABRE DAC achieves measurable performance improvements, and the objective sound field correction by YPAO R.S.C. directly leads to audible enhancements. The full implementation of 8K-compatible HDMI 2.1 is a rational decision for future-proofing. However, its necessity as a dedicated AV device remains questionable. Equivalent measurement performance can be achieved with a PC and a high-performance DAC setup or with lower-priced AV equipment from other manufacturers, and the unique value proposition to justify the significant price difference is insufficient.

## Advice

While the RX-A4A is an excellent AV receiver in terms of measurement performance and technical specifications, we do not recommend its purchase from a cost-performance perspective. The Denon AVR-S760H, which has comparable core measurement performance and basic features, is available for about 70,000 JPY less. The RX-A4A should only be considered if you have a strong preference for the Yamaha brand or find the advanced YPAO R.S.C. sound field correction to be worth the price difference. For general use, more affordable competing products provide perfectly adequate performance. We strongly recommend carefully judging whether the price difference is justified before making a purchase.
