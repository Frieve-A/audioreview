## Overview

The Yamaha NS-SW700 is a powered subwoofer with a 25 cm (10-inch) downward-firing cone in a bass-reflex enclosure. It uses Advanced YST II with ANIC, QD-Bass (down-firing layout), a linear port, and BASS (Movie/Music) mode. Manufacturer specifications list 300 W dynamic power, 20 Hz–160 Hz frequency response, 406 × 445 × 406 mm dimensions, and 21 kg weight [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are no credible third-party measurement reports for the NS-SW700. Only catalog values are available (20 Hz–160 Hz response, 300 W dynamic power; test conditions not disclosed) [1][2]. Without independent data for frequency response linearity, maximum output (CEA-2010), or distortion, its audible performance cannot be verified. The downward-firing design and servo scheme (Advanced YST II) may be beneficial, but the magnitude of any effect is unquantified absent measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The NS-SW700 reflects a conventional architecture from its era: servo-assisted bass-reflex design with mode switching and a 300 W amplifier (dynamic rating) [1][2]. It lacks contemporary conveniences like DSP app control, user PEQ, or published room-gain compensation profiles seen in newer models. While functional, the implementation does not demonstrate notable advances compared with current DSP-centric subwoofers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Using the required formula, CP is the ratio of the **cheapest equal-or-better** alternative to the review target’s price. RSL’s Speedwoofer 10S MKII (port-tuned 10-inch) is widely available at 501 USD [5] and has published third-party CEA-2010 data (2 m RMS) showing >107 dB at 40 Hz and ~102 dB at 25 Hz, with anechoic response of 22–200 Hz ±3 dB [6]. Given the NS-SW700’s performance is supported only by catalog specs, the RSL represents equal-or-better **user-facing** capability (documented output and extension) at a lower price.  
**Calculation:** 501 USD ÷ 780 USD = 0.642 → **0.6** (rounded to one decimal).  
For context, SVS SB-1000 Pro is 599 USD with 20–270 Hz ±3 dB, app control, and independent measurements [3][4]; however, it is not the cheapest equal-or-better option and is therefore not used in the CP numerator.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Yamaha’s service network and documentation are well established. The NS-SW700 is an older design with no firmware/app layer, so ongoing feature updates are not applicable. Warranty and service availability via authorized channels are typical for the brand; specific failure-rate data is not published [1][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Servo assistance (Advanced YST II) and a tuned port are rational approaches, but Yamaha does not publish transparent, third-party-verifiable data to substantiate audible benefits versus simpler modern DSP solutions. In today’s market, similarly sized subwoofers offer documented output, tuning controls, and app PEQ at lower prices [4][6], reducing the rationale for this model at its asking price.

## Advice

Unless you need exact model matching or find the NS-SW700 at a steep discount, favor modern subs with verified measurements. The RSL Speedwoofer 10S MKII offers documented output and strong value [5][6]. If you prefer sealed designs and app control, the SVS SB-1000 Pro adds a well-supported app and published measurements at a still-lower price than the Yamaha [3][4].
