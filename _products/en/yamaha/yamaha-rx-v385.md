## Overview

The RX-V385 is a 5.1-channel receiver introduced in 2018. Yamaha specifies 70 W per channel into 8Ω (20Hz–20kHz, 0.09% THD, two channels driven) with 4K/60p (4:4:4) HDR passthrough, YPAO auto calibration, and Bluetooth playback. Yamaha’s product page also details **eARC** support provided via firmware[1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comprehensive third-party bench tests specific to this model are not widely published. Per “unknown measurement” policy we anchor at 0.5 and document manufacturer figures: 70 W/8Ω (20Hz–20kHz, 0.09% THD, 2ch) and JEITA 145 W/6Ω (1kHz, 10% THD, 1ch)[1]. These are reasonable catalog specs; the score will be revised if reliable independent measurements emerge.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design is competent for its era: discrete amplification, Burr-Brown 32-bit/384 kHz DACs, YPAO, and modern HDR passthrough. It omits Atmos/DTS:X and the broader HDMI 2.1 feature set, but **adds eARC via firmware** for high-bandwidth TV app audio return[1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Cheapest equal-or-better comparator: **Denon AVR-S570BT** (5.2ch, eARC, 4K/120 & 8K/60 passthrough)[4]. Using current US market prices, **399.00 ÷ 399.95 = 0.997**, which rounds to 1.0 at one decimal.  
- Equivalence note: adds dual sub outs and newer HDMI features while maintaining comparable 5-channel power/class functions for typical 5.1 use[4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

In the US, Yamaha lists a **2-year** parts and labor warranty (confirmed by major retailer pages)[3]. Firmware updates have continued in recent years[7]. As an entry model without network streaming modules, long-term complexity is modest, but extensibility is limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A conservative, function-focused package: practical I/O, auto calibration, and now eARC address core living-room needs. The trade-off is limited forward-looking features versus similarly priced rivals that include newer HDMI gaming features or extra channels.

## Advice

For a compact, straightforward 5.1 setup—especially when relying on TV streaming apps via eARC—the RX-V385 remains a sensible choice. If you value 4K/120 gaming paths or dual subwoofer outs, **Denon AVR-S570BT** is a strong alternative at essentially the same US street price[4].
