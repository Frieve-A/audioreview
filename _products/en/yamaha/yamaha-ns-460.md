summary: "A 2-way bass reflex speaker released in the early 1980s featuring a 20cm woofer and 5cm radial tweeter with titanium dome structure. Without actual measurement data, objective performance evaluation remains inconclusive, though the basic acoustic design principles appear sound. Cost-performance evaluation is complicated by unverified vintage market pricing and methodological challenges in comparing 40-year-old equipment with modern alternatives requiring different usage considerations."

## Overview

The YAMAHA NS-460 is a 2-way bass reflex bookshelf speaker released around 1981. It features a 20cm cone woofer with spruce cone and a 5cm radial tweeter for high frequencies. The tweeter utilized an innovative radial design with a 25μm acoustic titanium center dome and surrounding cone paper arranged in a roll configuration, representing advanced technology for its era. The enclosure featured a black pecan finish, providing a premium appearance for its price range. Stereo Sound magazine praised it as "a masterpiece that appeals to general audiences while satisfying audiophile ears."

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Based on available specifications, the NS-460 features a 2-way design with 20cm woofer and 5cm radial tweeter using 25μm acoustic titanium center dome. Without access to actual measurement data for frequency response, THD, or SNR values, objective evaluation of scientific validity cannot be conclusively determined. The radial tweeter design and titanium dome construction represent legitimate engineering approaches for their era. Modern speaker designs benefit from advanced materials and measurement techniques, but the NS-460's basic acoustic principles remain sound. Evaluation requires actual measurement data rather than assumptions based solely on manufacturing era.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The NS-460 employed advanced technology for the 1980s. The radial tweeter with 25μm acoustic titanium center dome and roll-configured cone paper composite dome cone represented innovative design for its time. However, from current technological standards, these technologies have become obsolete. Modern tweeter designs utilize more efficient materials and design methodologies, making NS-460's technology unattractive today. Compared to latest digital signal processing technology, high-performance DAC chips, and low-distortion amplifier technology, the analog-era physical constraints significantly place its technical level below industry averages.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Cost-performance evaluation for vintage speakers requires verified current market pricing and appropriate comparisons. Current market research indicates Polk Audio T15 passive bookshelf speakers are available for approximately 147 USD per pair on major retail platforms. These provide similar 2-way passive configuration requiring external amplification. However, comparing 40-year-old vintage speakers with modern products presents methodological challenges, as usage requirements, reliability expectations, and performance standards differ significantly. Without verified current market pricing for NS-460 and considering the inherent risks of vintage audio equipment (parts availability, reliability concerns), a moderate cost-performance rating reflects both potential value and associated uncertainties.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The NS-460 is a discontinued product from over 40 years ago. Official support from Yamaha cannot be expected, and repair parts are difficult to obtain. Units circulating in the used market show aging deterioration including woofer edge degradation, tweeter performance decline, and internal wiring deterioration. Repairs require specialist service, with repair costs likely exceeding product value. Even original durability may not meet current quality standards given 1980s manufacturing technology.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The NS-460's design philosophy reflected sound acoustic engineering principles for passive speakers. The radial tweeter design and titanium dome technology represented rational approaches to achieving better dispersion and reduced distortion within the constraints of passive speaker design. While modern active speakers with built-in amplification and DSP offer different advantages, passive speakers remain a legitimate design approach with distinct benefits including flexibility in amplifier selection and potentially longer service life due to simpler electronics. The design philosophy focused on acoustic optimization rather than electronic processing, which remains a valid engineering approach. However, some design elements may not align with current best practices in driver materials and crossover design.

## Advice

The YAMAHA NS-460 presents a complex evaluation scenario as a vintage speaker requiring careful consideration of multiple factors. Without verified current market pricing or actual performance measurements, purchase decisions should be approached cautiously. Modern passive speakers like the Polk Audio T15 offer known performance characteristics, manufacturer support, and reliability at comparable price points. For those specifically interested in vintage audio equipment, the NS-460's titanium dome tweeter technology represents legitimate engineering merit, but buyers must accept inherent risks including unknown condition, lack of support, and potential repair costs. Consider modern alternatives unless vintage aesthetics or specific acoustic characteristics justify the additional uncertainties associated with 40-year-old equipment.
