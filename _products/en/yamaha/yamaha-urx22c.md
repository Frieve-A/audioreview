## Overview

The Yamaha URX22C represents Yamaha's latest entry in the professional audio interface market, offering a comprehensive 2-in/2-out USB-C solution for recording and streaming applications. Featuring Yamaha's renowned D-PRE mic preamps and an extensive DSP effects suite powered by the custom SSP3 chip, this compact metal-housed interface targets professional musicians, content creators, and audio engineers. The URX22C delivers 32-bit/192 kHz audio resolution with zero-latency monitoring capabilities, positioning itself as a versatile tool for modern digital audio production workflows.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The URX22C significantly exceeds transparent-level performance across multiple measurement criteria. Frequency response of +0.0/-0.4 dB (20 Hz to 22 kHz) [1] substantially exceeds the transparent requirement of ±0.5 dB with extended range beyond 20 kHz. Total harmonic distortion measures 0.003% at 1 kHz [1], significantly exceeding transparent level requirements of 0.01% or below by more than 3x margin. Dynamic range performance shows 102 dB for inputs (approaching transparent level of 105 dB) and 105 dB for outputs (meeting transparent criteria exactly) [1]. The 54 dB gain range provides adequate professional headroom for diverse microphone applications. These measurements demonstrate the interface delivers excellent transparent audio reproduction with particularly outstanding distortion and frequency response performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Yamaha demonstrates strong proprietary technology integration through D-PRE preamps utilizing discrete class-A inverted Darlington circuits and custom SSP3 DSP processing [2][3]. The D-PRE design employs cascaded transistor pairs providing enhanced power delivery with lower impedance, representing industry-recognized preamp technology. Custom SSP3 DSP enables zero-latency monitoring with comprehensive effects processing including PitchFix, Sweet Spot Morphing Channel Strip, and Guitar Amp Classics [2]. Modern 32-bit/192 kHz conversion represents contemporary industry standards while USB-C connectivity provides future-forward interfacing. Yamaha's decades of audio technology development and established market position demonstrate significant technical expertise and competitive advantage duration in professional audio applications.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Current market pricing shows the URX22C at 220 USD, competing against equivalent-or-better products with similar functionality and measured performance. The Steinberg UR22C provides equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance at 157 USD [6]. Equipped with 32-bit/192kHz resolution, D-PRE mic preamps, built-in DSP effects (REV-X reverb, channel strip, guitar amp), and MIDI I/O, the UR22C matches URX22C's feature set. Measured performance shows THD+N of 0.003% (1 kHz, 22 Hz/22 kHz BPF), 102 dB(A) dynamic range, and frequency response of +0.0/–0.4 dB (20 Hz–22 kHz) [6], equivalent to URX22C specifications. CP = 157 ÷ 220 = 0.71, rounded to 0.7. The UR22C delivers equivalent functionality and measured performance at lower cost, resulting in moderate cost-performance evaluation for URX22C.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The URX22C features robust metal housing construction with simple interface design minimizing failure-prone components. Yamaha provides limited 1-year manufacturer warranty [4], below the industry standard 2-year coverage, requiring authorized dealer purchases for warranty validity. Global Yamaha support infrastructure operates through established dealer networks with defined RMA processes for warranty claims. Yamaha's extensive track record in professional audio equipment demonstrates strong reliability history and manufacturer stability. The combination of robust construction and established support systems provides above-average reliability assurance despite shorter warranty period.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Yamaha's "Natural Sound" philosophy emphasizes transparency and measurement-focused audio reproduction without subjective or occult claims [5]. The approach prioritizes preserving artistic quality through transparent signal paths rather than colored sound characteristics. DSP functionality directly contributes to recording capability by eliminating external processing hardware requirements while maintaining zero-latency monitoring. Modern 32-bit/192 kHz specifications and USB-C connectivity represent functional evolution addressing contemporary production needs. Advanced DSP integration provides practical workflow benefits through comprehensive effects processing and flexible routing options. This scientifically rational approach aligns with measurement-based audio principles while delivering genuine functional value to users.

## Advice

The Yamaha URX22C suits professional users requiring transparent audio performance with comprehensive DSP capabilities for recording and streaming applications. The interface excels for musicians and content creators needing zero-latency monitoring with high-quality effects processing and MIDI connectivity. Consider this option if D-PRE preamp quality, MIDI I/O, advanced DSP effects, and Yamaha's established support ecosystem provide value for your specific workflow requirements. However, the Steinberg UR22C (157 USD) offers equivalent functionality and measured performance at lower cost, making careful assessment of feature requirements essential for budget-conscious buyers seeking optimal cost-performance.
