## Overview

The XUELIN iHiFi 990 is a portable digital audio player positioned as the company's flagship model, featuring dual WM8740 DAC chips and aluminum CNC construction. Released circa 2016-2017, it targets audiophiles seeking high-resolution audio playback with native DSD support. XUELIN, established in 2002 by Dr. Shi Xuelin from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has positioned itself as a provider of affordable alternatives to premium portable players. The device offers comprehensive format support including DSD/DFF/ISO playback, multiple output modes (headphone, line, and coaxial digital), and MicroSD expansion up to 200GB. Current pricing stands at 245 USD based on available retailer listings.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate promising measured performance with THD below 0.003%, representing excellent distortion control significantly exceeding typical portable player capabilities. S/N ratio exceeding 106dB demonstrates high noise performance meeting professional audio standards. Frequency response spanning 20Hz-20kHz with -1dB deviation approaches high-fidelity requirements, though not achieving the precision of reference-grade equipment. However, these values rely entirely on manufacturer specifications without independent third-party verification from credible measurement sources. No measurements were found from Audio Science Review, Reference Audio Analyzer, or other established testing facilities despite comprehensive searches. Conservative evaluation applied due to unverified nature of performance claims, as actual measured values may differ from published specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The iHiFi 990 employs entirely conventional component selection without proprietary innovation or technical differentiation. Core technology centers on dual WM8740 DACs, now-discontinued legacy chips from Wolfson Microelectronics that were respected but represent aging technology following the company's acquisition by Cirrus Logic. Supporting components include standard licensed parts: AD8610 operational amplifiers, AD8397 headphone amplification, JZ4760B ARM processor, and PGA2311A digital volume control. All components are readily available to competitors with no technical barriers to replication. No evidence of patents, proprietary design elements, or unique engineering approaches beyond conventional dual-DAC stereo implementation. The design philosophy reflects conservative assembly of proven components rather than innovative development, offering no competitive advantage duration as identical configurations can be easily reproduced by other manufacturers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Following policy guidelines for cross-category comparison, the iHiFi 990 was evaluated against general-purpose equipment combinations that achieve equivalent user-facing functions and measured performance. The review target at 245 USD provides DSD playback, headphone output, line output, coaxial digital output, and manufacturer specifications of THD below 0.003% and S/N ratio exceeding 106dB.

An equivalent-or-better combination consists of: budget smartphone with USB audio support (approximately 80 USD), FiiO JA11 dongle DAC (39 USD, THD below 0.003% at 300 ohm, SNR 115dB or above, DSD128 support with 10-band parametric EQ) [1], and HiBy UC10 USB-C to coaxial S/PDIF converter (29 USD) [2]. This combination provides headphone output via JA11, coaxial digital output via UC10, and measured performance equivalent-or-better than the review target. Total combination price is approximately 148 USD.

CP = 148 USD / 245 USD = 0.6

This evaluation follows the policy principle that dedicated audio equipment existence is not justified when general-purpose equipment combinations can achieve equivalent functions and measured performance at lower cost. Users already owning smartphones would require only the DAC and converter accessories (approximately 68 USD), further diminishing the value proposition of the dedicated DAP.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Support infrastructure appears poorly developed with significant limitations affecting long-term ownership experience. No official warranty period documentation found across manufacturer sources or major retailer listings, creating uncertainty about coverage duration and terms. User reports indicate communication difficulties with XUELIN customer service, suggesting inadequate support channels for problem resolution. No documented official service center network or repair infrastructure, likely requiring third-party service arrangements with uncertain parts availability. Firmware update support remains unclear despite the device requiring software maintenance as a digital player, with only community-modified firmware available through enthusiast forums. Build quality receives generally positive feedback with stable aluminum construction and no documented manufacturing defects, though long-term users report potential navigation wheel mechanism wear requiring workarounds. Limited information about failure rates or longevity data compounds uncertainty about reliability expectations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The iHiFi 990 employs standard delta-sigma DAC technology (WM8740) rather than scientifically questionable approaches such as vacuum tubes or R2R ladder DACs marketed for subjective "warmth." However, several factors reduce the rationality score. Marketing emphasizes subjective characteristics like "smooth and warm tuning" without scientific verification of audible benefits, representing claims of non-audible effects. Technology adoption reflects conservative implementation using aging OEM components (discontinued WM8740) without DSP, software-based signal processing, or other modern technologies that could improve functionality and reduce costs. The product lacks justification for existence as dedicated equipment when general-purpose combinations (smartphone plus external DAC) achieve equivalent or superior measured performance at lower cost. Innovation attitude is conservative with no evidence of proprietary development or technical advancement. Cost allocation includes aluminum CNC construction which provides durability benefits but does not directly improve measured audio performance. While not representing extreme irrationality such as occult audio products, the design philosophy prioritizes conventional approaches over measurement-driven optimization.

## Advice

The iHiFi 990 faces significant competition from general-purpose equipment combinations. Users seeking portable DSD playback with coaxial digital output can achieve equivalent-or-better measured performance using a smartphone paired with modern dongle DACs and digital converters at substantially lower total cost. The combination of FiiO JA11 and HiBy UC10 provides superior measured specifications (115dB SNR versus 106dB) with additional benefits including parametric EQ functionality absent from the iHiFi 990. Poor support infrastructure presents significant risk for long-term ownership, particularly given the device's age and unclear parts availability. Users already owning smartphones should strongly consider accessory-based solutions. Only users specifically requiring offline standalone operation without smartphone dependency may find value in the dedicated DAP format, though even this advantage diminishes against the substantial cost savings achievable through combination approaches.
