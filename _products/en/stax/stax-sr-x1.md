## Overview

The STAX SR-X1 is an entry-level electrostatic earspeaker that revives the classic circular form with modernized mechanics and cabling. It targets first-time electrostatic buyers and is listed at 535 USD on the official store [1]. In Japan, the MSRP is 66,000円 [3]. A bundle with the SRM-270S energizer (SRS-X1000) is also available [4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent third-party measurements (FR deviation, THD vs SPL, unit variance) are not yet widely published. Manufacturer specifications list 7–41,000 Hz reproduction band, sensitivity 101 dB/100 V rms at 1 kHz, impedance 145 kΩ at 10 kHz (including 2.5 m cable), weight 234 g, and DC 580 V bias [1][3]. Pending lab-grade data (or controlled ABX), the score remains at the 0.5 baseline.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

SR-X1 employs a push-pull electrostatic circular driver with etched electrodes, an open-back slit structure to smooth airflow, a more rigid metal arc assembly, and a low-capacitance OFC “wide” cable [1][3]. These are sensible refinements for an entry model, yet evolutionary rather than category-advancing; hence 0.6.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Comparator (cross-category, chosen by function & published specs):** **Sennheiser HD 560S** — open-back, wired over-ear headphone with **published THD < 0.05% (1 kHz / 90 dB)** and FR **6 Hz – 38 kHz**; both are at least on-paper equal or superior along audibility-relevant axes vs the SR-X1 whose THD is not published [5][6]. Current new price **199.95 USD** (official US store) [5].  

**Calculation (explicit):** 199.95 USD ÷ 535 USD = **0.3737… → 0.4** (rounded to one decimal).  
*Note:* Within electrostatics specifically, SR-X1 remains the lowest-priced new over-ear option; however CP is evaluated across categories and strictly by user-visible function and published performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Electrostatic drivers are mechanically simple (few moving parts). STAX has long product continuity (+0.1). Warranty is standard (JP: 1 year) [3]. Support is dealer-centric (±0). The official SR-X1 + SRM-270S bundle indicates parts/system continuity [4]. Net 0.7.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Requiring a dedicated energizer and bias voltage limits amplifier flexibility and portability. Without verified transparency-level measurements yet, the approach trades convenience for a specific transducer principle; rational for niche use, but not broadly optimal per dollar → 0.3.

## Advice

SR-X1 suits listeners intentionally entering the STAX ecosystem at the lowest new-market price for an over-ear electrostatic. Budget for a compatible energizer and evaluate fit/comfort. If your priority is neutral tuning with strong published/third-party metrics at lower system cost, well-measured open-backs like the HD 560S merit consideration [5][6].
