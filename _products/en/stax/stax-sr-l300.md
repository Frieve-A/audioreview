## Overview

The STAX SR-L300 is an entry-level electrostatic headphone manufactured by STAX, a Japanese specialist manufacturer of electrostatic headphones. Founded in 1938, the company is known as a pioneer in electrostatic driver technology, and the SR-L300 occupies the most affordable price segment in their product lineup. It employs push-pull electrostatic design, elliptical sound elements, and rear open-air type enclosure, achieving wide-band reproduction from 7-41,000Hz and THD below 0.01%. However, due to the nature of electrostatic technology, a dedicated voltage amplifier (energizer) is mandatory, making the actual introduction cost significantly exceed the headphone unit price alone.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The SR-L300's measured performance shows excellent figures for an electrostatic headphone. THD below 0.01% meets transparency level standards, and the 7-41,000Hz frequency response achieves wide-band reproduction. The 101dB/100Vr.m.s sensitivity and 112dB maximum SPL are also at practical levels. However, there is significant attenuation in the sub-bass region, creating constraints for low-frequency reproduction in electronic music and movies. Due to the physical characteristics of electrostatic type, while it falls short of dynamic types in low-frequency quantity, it maintains measurable advantages in mid-high frequency resolution and transparency. The S/N ratio of the entire system when combined with dedicated amplifiers also maintains high standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While STAX is a specialist manufacturer with over 80 years of accumulated electrostatic driver technology, the SR-L300 shows technical compromises as the company's entry model. Basic designs such as push-pull electrostatic structure and low-capacitance OFC cable are solid, but cost reductions are evident in areas like thin ear pads and resin housing compared to higher-end models. The 580V DC bias voltage design is appropriate, but the 145kΩ impedance characteristic creates the constraint of requiring dedicated amplifiers. From a modern perspective, there are more efficient approaches (high-performance planar types) to achieve equivalent sound quality, raising questions about the rationality of the technology choice.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

While the SR-L300 unit price is 455 USD, the total cost rises significantly when including the essential dedicated amplifier. Combined with the SRM-D10 II, it totals 1,400 USD (945 USD + 455 USD). For fair system-to-system comparison, planar headphones that provide equivalent or superior sound quality exist, such as the HiFiMan Ananda (700 USD) which requires a suitable headphone amplifier such as the Schiit Magni/Modi stack (approximately 300 USD), totaling 1,000 USD for the complete system. In cost-performance calculation, comparing complete systems yields 1,000 USD ÷ 1,400 USD = 0.71, which rounds to 0.7. Even considering the unique sonic advantages of electrostatic type, there exists approximately a 40% price difference when comparing complete listening systems.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While STAX has certain reliability as an established manufacturer, the nature of electrostatic headphones presents maintenance challenges. Electrostatic drivers are sensitive to humidity and static electricity, and repair costs tend to be expensive when failures occur. The warranty period is standard, but domestic authorized dealer support systems are well-established. However, since the premise is combination with dedicated amplifiers, the failure risk of the entire system becomes higher than single products. The integrated cable design also presents a negative reliability factor, as cable damage requires major repairs.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

While electrostatic technology itself has theoretically superior sound quality characteristics, there are irrational aspects to the design philosophy from a modern perspective. The constraint of requiring dedicated amplifiers significantly increases user convenience and introduction costs. Currently, high-performance planar drivers can achieve equivalent performance with general-purpose amplifiers, so the significance of electrostatic type has relatively declined. The complete impossibility of portable use also doesn't suit modern lifestyles. However, the unique advantages of electrostatic type in mid-high frequency transparency and resolution are recognized, and there is value for specific applications (classical music, etc.). While there is significance from the perspective of preserving traditional technology, rationality is questionable in the modern era that emphasizes practicality.

## Advice

When considering purchasing the SR-L300, it's important to first accurately understand the total introduction cost. In addition to the headphone unit price of 455 USD, an additional investment of 945 USD (SRM-D10 II) for the dedicated amplifier is necessary, bringing the total system cost to 1,400 USD. For those who feel strong attraction to the unique transparency and resolution of electrostatic type and primarily enjoy classical music or acoustic music in quiet environments, there is value. However, if you prioritize cost-performance, we recommend first considering planar headphones such as the HiFiMan Ananda (700 USD) with a suitable amplifier (approximately 300 USD), totaling around 1,000 USD for a complete system. These can be driven by general-purpose amplifiers and provide balanced sound quality including low-frequency reproduction. Even if you have strong interest in electrostatic type, we recommend first trying them in the used market. Note that the SR-L300 has been announced as the final production lot, so if you decide to purchase, early decision-making is necessary.
