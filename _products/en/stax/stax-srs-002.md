## Overview

The Stax SRS-002 is a battery-operated portable electrostatic in-ear system combining the SR-002 electrostatic earspeakers with the SRM-002 driver unit. As the successor to earlier Stax portable models, this system represents the company's attempt to bring electrostatic technology to portable in-ear applications. The system features a redesigned ear canal structure with a 1.5-micron diaphragm that is 15% lighter than previous models, along with switchable power modes for battery optimization.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate frequency response of 20Hz-1kHz ±2dB and 1kHz-20kHz ±4dB [5], placing performance at transparent level borderline according to measurement criteria for headphones (±3dB standard). THD specification of maximum 0.1% at 1kHz [2] meets excellent thresholds for headphones. However, critical measurements including S/N ratio, dynamic range, IMD, crosstalk, and passive isolation data are unavailable from credible third-party sources. Conservative evaluation applied by moving score 0.1 toward 0.5 due to reliance solely on manufacturer specifications without independent verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Stax demonstrates high technical competency through proprietary electrostatic transducer technology developed since 1959, extensive patent portfolio, and specialized manufacturing expertise accumulated over 65+ years. The 1.5-micron diaphragm represents meaningful engineering advancement with 15% mass reduction compared to previous models. Design ownership and competitive advantage duration justify strong technology scoring, though the purely analog approach without modern digital integration prevents maximum scoring.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Cost-performance evaluation requires comparison with products providing equivalent or better user-facing functionality and measured performance, regardless of internal transducer technology differences. The Moondrop Aria (79 USD) [3] provides equivalent in-ear monitoring functionality with superior measured performance: frequency response 5Hz-36kHz effective range [4], 122dB/Vrms sensitivity, and 32Ω impedance. Equipped with essential in-ear functions, and frequency response range and sensitivity are equivalent-or-better. While the SRS-002 utilizes electrostatic transducer technology, from a user perspective both products deliver in-ear audio reproduction with the Aria achieving broader frequency response and higher sensitivity. CP = 79 USD ÷ 700 USD = 0.1.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The system includes standard 1-year warranty coverage and dealer-based support through authorized retailers. Stax's 65-year manufacturing experience provides institutional knowledge for long-term support. However, electrostatic drivers exhibit known sensitivities to dust infiltration, humidity exposure, and potential channel imbalance over extended periods. Operating conditions must remain within 0-35°C with maximum 90% humidity without condensation [5]. These environmental constraints and inherent electrostatic technology vulnerabilities create reliability concerns that require careful handling and storage protocols.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Stax's design philosophy centers on "Quiet Soul" (静魂) principles emphasizing "colorless and transparent without adding color or flavor to the impression of sound" [6]. The company's measurement-focused scientific approach prioritizes objective performance metrics over subjective preferences, demonstrated through patent technology development and iterative engineering improvements. The 1.5-micron diaphragm achieving 15% mass reduction represents meaningful technical advancement toward faster transient response. While the analog-only approach lacks modern digital integration, the focus on fundamental transducer physics optimization aligns with rational engineering principles for achieving transparency objectives.

## Advice

The SRS-002 serves as the unique entry point for portable electrostatic in-ear technology, appealing to users specifically seeking electrostatic transducer characteristics. For conventional in-ear monitoring applications, dynamic driver alternatives like the Moondrop Aria offer excellent performance-to-price ratios within traditional technologies. Purchase justified when electrostatic transducer properties - ultra-thin diaphragm response, minimal magnetic interference, and characteristic transparency - align with specific user requirements. Ensure proper environmental controls regarding temperature and humidity exposure to maintain long-term electrostatic driver stability.
