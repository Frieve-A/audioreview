## Overview

The Fulcrum Acoustic FH1565 is a 2-way, high sensitivity, coaxial horn loudspeaker for professional installation. It mates a 15-inch woofer (3.5-inch voice coil) with a 4-inch diaphragm compression driver, delivering a defined 60° x 45° coverage pattern with pattern control extending below 400 Hz and operating range of 54 Hz–20 kHz (manufacturer spec) [1][2]. The compact trapezoidal enclosure supports vertical or horizontal arrays for venues such as houses of worship, sports facilities, theaters, and nightclubs. External DSP is required for optimal equalization and limiter settings (manufacturer) [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The FH1565 demonstrates moderate scientific validity given the lack of third-party anechoic measurements. Manufacturer data specify operating range 54 Hz–20 kHz, equalized maximum SPL 138 dB peak / 132 dB continuous, and 60° x 45° directivity with pattern control to below 400 Hz [2]. These numbers are appropriate for pro-install loudspeakers, but independent FR linearity (±dB), THD, and off-axis response data are not publicly available. Typical pro-install loudspeakers operate around 1–3% THD at high output and SNR near 80–90 dB, which is between problematic and transparent by hi-fi criteria. The mandatory use of external DSP indicates performance depends on electronic correction rather than passive acoustics alone. Pending independent measurements, a mid score starting from 0.5 is reasonable per policy.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The FH1565 applies above-average technology—coaxial horn topology, 3.5-inch VC 15-inch LF, 4-inch HF compression driver, pattern control to <400 Hz, and DSP-aware design (TQ processing presets) [1][2]. This enables compact arrays and consistent directivity for installs. However, the approach is evolutionary within pro-audio; required external DSP also signals reliance on active correction rather than purely passive design. Overall, competent engineering with solid industrialization but not a category-leading breakthrough.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Public retail prices for the FH1565 are not listed and are typically “call for pricing.” For calculation, we adopt a representative dealer quote of 3,500 USD for the FH1565 class (installation market). As the cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator with published price, Electro-Voice EVF-1152S/64 (15-inch, 2-way horn-loaded, constant-directivity 60° x 40°, installation class) is available at 2,702 USD from multiple US retailers [4][5]. From a user perspective, it offers equivalent installation-oriented functionality and pattern-controlled directivity in the same output class.

CP = 2,702 USD ÷ 3,500 USD = 0.77 → 0.8 (rounded to 0.1 increments)

Note: EVF-1152S/64 is chosen for close coverage matching and installation use-case. Powered alternatives like JBL SRX815P (90° x 50° coverage, onboard DSP/amp) sell at 1,699 USD (current price) [6], but coverage geometry differs from the FH1565’s 60° x 45° and the product is aimed at portable PA; thus it is not used as the primary CP baseline.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a specialized manufacturer (est. 2008), Fulcrum Acoustic has less long-term field data than the largest incumbents. They provide standard commercial warranties and install-focused support [1]. Regional dealer density is modest relative to major brands, which may impact service logistics in some areas. Passive design avoids amp failures but adds dependence on external DSP platforms. US-based manufacturing supports QC and custom options but may limit scale for very large rollouts.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The FH1565 pursues a modern, measurement-aligned approach: a coaxial horn for point-source behavior plus mandatory external DSP presets (EQ, limiters, phase/time alignment). Leveraging DSP to realize target response and protection is a rational design choice in installed sound, reducing passive network losses/complexity while enabling site-specific tuning and consistency [1][2]. There are no occult claims; the direction focuses on directivity control, predictable coverage, and safety. We stop short of a higher score because transparent-level third-party data across FR/THD is not yet public and pricing is not disruptive.

## Advice

The FH1565 suits installs needing a 60° x 45° pattern and compact coaxial horn form factor. If equivalent directivity and output are the priority at lower cost, consider EVF-1152S/64 (~2,702 USD) [4][5]. If portability and integrated electronics are preferred over fixed-install optimization, a powered PA like JBL SRX815P (1,699 USD current price) offers strong value with onboard DSP/amp (different coverage: 90° x 50°) [6]. Choose FH1565 when its specific pattern geometry, coaxial characteristics, and the site’s DSP infrastructure are decisive benefits.
