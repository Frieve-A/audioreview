## Overview

The dCS Vivaldi Transport II is the flagship CD transport from UK-based dCS, launched in November 2023. Priced at approximately 50,000 USD, it combines a Sound United D&M mechanism with dCS's proprietary digital processing technology. The Mark II was developed as a successor model following the discontinuation of the previously used TEAC Esoteric Neo VMK-3 mechanism, incorporating technological advances gained from Vivaldi series development.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The essential function of a CD transport is accurate digital data reading and delivery. With modern technology standards, even a 600 USD Cambridge Audio CXC can deliver 16bit/44.1kHz data with bit-perfect accuracy. The Transport II's claimed "transparency improvements" and "jitter reduction" effects lack objective measurement data demonstrating audible differences within the audible range. Given that CD format itself has a 96dB dynamic range and 20Hz-20kHz bandwidth limitation, it is questionable whether extremely expensive dedicated equipment provides measurable improvements (THD below 0.01%, SNR above 105dB). Considering the theoretical completeness of digital data transfer, the transparent-level sound quality required by measurement result standards can be sufficiently achieved with much less expensive equipment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

dCS combines its proprietary digital processing platform with a Sound United D&M mechanism, incorporating technology accumulated from Vivaldi series development. The aerospace-grade aluminum chassis, multi-stage power regulation, and improved power supply system demonstrate considerable engineering capability. However, it is unclear how much these technologies ultimately contribute to digital data delivery accuracy. While the technical capability itself is commendable, the necessity in the application field of CD playback is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Against the Transport II's price of approximately 50,000 USD, the Cambridge Audio CXC offering equivalent basic functions (CD playback, digital output) is available for about 600 USD. Cost-performance calculation: 600 USD รท 50,000 USD = 0.012, which rounds to 0.0. The CXC similarly features S/PDIF and AES/EBU outputs, accurately delivering 16bit/44.1kHz data. While the Transport II has the additional feature of SACD support, no essential superiority exists in basic CD playback performance, and no objective basis justifies the 83-fold price difference. This price differential is judged to be based purely on brand value and subjective elements.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As an established digital audio manufacturer founded in 1987, dCS has proven technical capability and support infrastructure. The company's products are used in studios and broadcast stations worldwide, with extensive industrial application track record. The Transport II achieves reduced operating temperature and improved power fluctuation resistance through its improved power system, making it promising from a long-term reliability perspective. International sales networks and support systems are well-established, meeting expectations for products in this price range.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The existence rationale for dedicated CD transport equipment raises scientific questions. In the basic function of digital data delivery, it is highly doubtful whether a 50,000 USD investment provides auditorily meaningful improvements. Considering the reality that equivalent functions can be achieved for 600 USD, the rationality must be deemed low. With the proliferation of modern software signal processing technology and network distribution, the necessity for physical media playback dedicated equipment itself is decreasing, representing a design philosophy that goes against the times. The development approach emphasizing subjective "luxury feel" over transparency improvements based on measurement data is irrational.

## Advice

Those considering purchase are strongly recommended to first experience equivalent basic functions with the Cambridge Audio CXC (600 USD). Only consider purchase if you can clearly recognize sound quality differences between the two and find 49,400 USD worth of value in that difference. Considering the physical constraints of CD format, the investment effect in this price range is extremely limited. If high-quality playback is the goal, investing the same budget in speakers or room acoustic improvements would yield far greater sound quality improvement effects. We recommend making rational judgments based on scientific evidence, without being misled by the audio industry's subjective evaluations or authority. In an era where digital music distribution has become widespread, massive investment in dedicated CD transport equipment must be considered anachronistic.
