## Overview

The dCS Lina DAC-X is a network streamer-integrated DAC launched by British high-end audio manufacturer dCS in June 2025. Priced at 13,500 GBP (15,500 USD), it features the company's proprietary Ring DAC technology and supports PCM 24bit/384kHz and DSD128. Positioned as the upper model in the Lina series with added volume control, remote control, and CD/SACD transport connection functionality, it offers a four-stage output level selection of 0.2V, 0.6V, 2V, and 6V. Hand-assembled and inspected at dCS's Cambridge factory, it maintains the traditional quality of dCS high-end audio products.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Lina DAC-X achieves transparent-level measurement performance. Total harmonic distortion (THD) is extremely low at 0.00009-0.00017% at 2V output, significantly clearing the transparent level (0.01% or below). The S/N ratio meets the standard of 105 dB or above with 109.1dB at 2V output and 117.0dB at 6V output. The frequency response achieves ±0.01dB accuracy between 20Hz-20kHz, significantly exceeding the standard of within ±0.5dB. Jitter performance is also maintained at an ultra-low level of approximately 20psec, delivering measurement results that enable completely transparent reproduction for human hearing.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

It adopts dCS's proprietary Ring DAC technology and a single flex-rigid PCB design, demonstrating technical uniqueness in the industry. The technology level of digital signal processing is high-standard through multi-stage DXD oversampling functionality and switchable DSD upsampling functionality. The hand-assembly and inspection system is also commendable from a quality control perspective. However, the transparent-level performance achieved in measurements can also be realized by more affordable general-purpose chips, limiting its absolute superiority in terms of technology investment.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The main functions provided by this unit (network streaming, high-performance DAC, volume control) can be achieved at a much lower cost by combining generic components. For example, combining a network streamer like the Wiim Pro Plus (approx. 219 USD) with a DAC that boasts measurement performance equal to or better than this unit, such as the Topping D90 III Sabre (approx. 899 USD), results in a total price of about 1,118 USD. Based on the formula, 1,118 USD ÷ 15,500 USD ≈ 0.072, which rounds to a score of 0.1. While this combination does not offer the proprietary dCS CD/SACD transport connection or the high 6V output, it achieves the core network playback function and audio quality performance at about 1/14th of the price. Therefore, the cost-performance must be rated as extremely poor.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

dCS is an established manufacturer with over 30 years of experience in the high-end audio field, and its product reliability is considered to exceed industry standards. The quality control system is good, with hand-assembly and inspection at their Cambridge factory. The policy of supporting functional improvements throughout the product's lifetime via free software updates is also commendable. However, there is insufficient information on the specific advantages of its warranty period and repair support system in this price range.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy of aiming for transparent-level sound quality based on measurement results is scientifically rational. The realization of low distortion through Ring DAC technology and the integration of network streaming functionality to support modern usage environments are commendable. However, with a combination of products existing that achieves similar measurement performance at about 1/14th the price, the rationality of the 15,500 USD price tag is highly questionable. While unique features like the CD/SACD transport connection and 6V output are appreciated, they do not provide sufficient added value to justify the price difference for the purpose of achieving transparent-level sound quality, making the rationality of the design philosophy limited from a cost-efficiency perspective.

## Advice

The dCS Lina DAC-X achieves impeccable transparent-level measurement performance, but the rational basis for its 15,500 USD price is extremely limited. Similar network streaming functionality and transparent-level measurement performance can be realized for a total of about 1,118 USD with a combination like the Wiim Pro Plus (approx. 219 USD) and the Topping D90 III Sabre (approx. 899 USD), and no audible difference in basic sound quality can be expected. It may have value for specific applications requiring the proprietary dCS CD/SACD transport connection or 6V output setting, or for purchasers who value the dCS brand and finest finishing, but it cannot be recommended at all for general network playback applications. Purchasers seeking a rational choice are advised to first confirm if they are satisfied with an inexpensive streamer and high-performance DAC combination, and only consider this product if the unique dCS features are an absolute necessity.
