summary: "A high-end CD/SACD transport from UK's dCS. While its measurement performance is excellent, it is extraordinarily expensive compared to functionally equivalent products, making its existence highly questionable."

## Overview

The dCS Rossini Transport is a CD/SACD transport developed by the British high-end audio manufacturer dCS. Priced as an ultra-high-end unit at USD 23,500, it incorporates the company's digital processing platform. It features a dual-laser CD/SACD mechanism and has the capability to upsample CD data to DSD128 or DXD (24bit/352.8kHz). The chassis measures 444×178×437mm, weighs 20.6kg, and is available in silver or black finishes. It is claimed to achieve high-precision jitter reduction and signal processing through a single FPGA-based digital processing technology developed from the company's Vivaldi series.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance is exceptionally good. Measurements by Stereophile magazine recorded an extremely low jitter performance of under 30psec, a value that significantly exceeds the level of transparency. In error correction tests using the Pierre Verany Digital Test CD, it showed excellent capability, with no glitches in a 500Hz tone for gaps up to 2mm long. The AES/EBU output's eye-pattern measurement also confirmed good data stream quality, indicating a high level of digital signal integrity. On the two key metrics for a CD/SACD transport (error handling and jitter performance), it shows excellent results approaching the level of transparency.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

It incorporates the dCS digital processing platform and performs signal processing using a single FPGA. The feature of upsampling CD data to DSD or DXD is technically advanced, but today, many products offer similar functionality, so it cannot be considered a standout advantage unique to dCS. While the chassis design and vibration control are robust, the core transport mechanism is a Denon OEM unit, not an in-house development. This choice was made after the supply of Esoteric mechanisms ended, but for a product in this price range, it lacks technical originality. Although it represents a high level of technology in the industry, it does not reach the highest standard.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The cost-performance is abysmal. The core function of this unit, "outputting SACD's DSD signal digitally," can be achieved with much cheaper products. For example, the Shanling SCD1.3 (USD 1,299) is an SACD player that supports digital output of DSD signals via I2S and USB. A simple price comparison shows `USD 1,299 ÷ USD 23,500 ≈ 0.055`, meaning the dCS Rossini Transport is about 18 times more expensive than a functionally equivalent product. The slight differences in measurement performance are meaningless to human hearing and in no way justify this enormous price gap. A practically identical result can be achieved for less than one-twentieth of the cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A 3-year warranty is provided by dCS, an established British manufacturer with a well-regarded service system. The company has a long history as a high-end audio equipment manufacturer, so the continuity of after-sales service can be expected. However, the Denon transport mechanism used raises concerns about long-term durability compared to the previously used Esoteric mechanisms. The reliability of the mechanism part has increased uncertainty compared to past models. Software support, including firmware updates, is provided appropriately.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

While the pursuit of measurable jitter performance is rational in itself, the overall design philosophy of the product is questionable. In the face of modern high-performance jitter reduction technology, a separated transport and DAC configuration has no scientifically proven sonic advantage and serves only to increase costs and justify a high price tag as a marketing strategy. A more cost-effective and versatile system can be built using a general-purpose PC or network streamer combined with a high-performance DAC. From an economic rationality standpoint, the raison d'être of an expensive dedicated transport like this is extremely low.

## Advice

While the dCS Rossini Transport is a product with excellent measured performance, it is absolutely not recommended for purchase. The price of USD 23,500 is exorbitant for its functionality. For instance, an SACD player like the Shanling SCD1.3 (USD 1,299) also supports digital output of DSD signals and can provide a practically identical music playback experience for less than one-twentieth of the price. The minute differences in measurements are imperceptible to human hearing and do not provide any value to justify the massive price difference. There is no reason to choose this unit other than for a strong attachment to the dCS brand or the desire to own it as a status symbol. If you are pursuing audio performance rationally, other options are strongly recommended.
