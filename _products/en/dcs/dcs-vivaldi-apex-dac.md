## Overview

The dCS Vivaldi Apex DAC is a top-tier digital-to-analog converter from the British manufacturer dCS. Based on the company's proprietary Ring DAC technology, the APEX upgrade introduces a new analog output circuit and an improved circuit board to further reduce distortion and enhance linearity. Priced at 46,500 USD, it is aimed at a broad audience from professional studios to high-end audiophiles. It features multiple selectable filters and achieves exceptionally high measured performance through its unique Ring DAC technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

According to third-party measurements, the unit's THD+Noise reaches -112dB (approx. 0.00025%), which is a state-of-the-art performance that significantly clears the transparent level of 0.01%. The S/N ratio exceeds 113dB, satisfying the transparent level of 105dB+. Crosstalk is also below -115dB, an extremely excellent separation characteristic far exceeding the -70dB standard. These figures scientifically demonstrate its capability for completely transparent reproduction for human hearing. However, it should be noted that today, comparable or even better measured performance is achieved by far less expensive DACs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

dCS's proprietary Ring DAC technology is a completely in-house developed architecture that does not rely on off-the-shelf DAC chips, making it technically extremely advanced. The APEX upgrade further enhances performance from the previous model by redesigning the main circuit board and employing a new analog output stage. State-of-the-art technology is incorporated throughout, including multiple reconstruction filters, a high-precision clocking system with thermally-stabilized custom crystal oscillators, a fully balanced configuration, and an ultra-low impedance output stage. Its technical achievement is highly commendable.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

When comparing this unit's performance to more affordable alternatives, its cost-performance is nonexistent. For example, the Topping D90LE, priced at 899 USD, achieves superior measured performance (SINAD 124dB) to this unit. The calculation is: 899 USD รท 46,500 USD = 0.019, resulting in a score of 0.0. The Vivaldi series' network playback function is handled by a separate "Upsampler" unit, making this product a pure DAC. Therefore, a functional comparison with the Topping D90LE, also a pure DAC, is appropriate. This means that core performance equivalent to or better than the Vivaldi Apex DAC is available for about 1/50th of the price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

dCS, founded in 1987, is a long-established British manufacturer with an extensive track record in the professional market. They have a global network of authorized dealers providing comprehensive after-sales service. The existence of upgrade programs like APEX demonstrates a commitment to long-term support for existing users and is highly commendable. The product's robust design and quality control suggest reliability that exceeds the industry average. However, due to its proprietary technology, repairs require specialized support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While the development policy of aiming for transparent sound quality through improved measured performance is scientific in itself, the means of achieving it is highly questionable. At today's technological level, superior measured performance to this unit can be achieved at less than 1/50th the cost using general-purpose DAC chips. Nevertheless, continuing to adhere to the enormously expensive proprietary Ring DAC technology lacks significant rationality from a scientific and engineering cost-benefit perspective. This results in forcing unnecessary costs onto the user.

## Advice

When considering the purchase of this unit, it is essential to first recognize the existence of more affordable and better-measuring products like the Topping D90LE (899 USD). The 46,500 USD price tag should be understood as being largely for elements such as dCS's proprietary technology, brand, and the chassis's design and finish, rather than for core DAC performance. If the goal is purely faithful reproduction of the master recording, allocating the budget for this unit towards speakers and room acoustics will yield far greater improvements in sound quality. This product is best described as being for a select few audio enthusiasts who find value in its underlying technological story and brand ownership.
