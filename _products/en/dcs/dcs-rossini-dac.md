## Overview

The dCS Rossini APEX DAC is a flagship-class digital-to-analog converter from the British high-end audio manufacturer, dCS. It features the proprietary Ring DAC APEX technology, developed over 30 years, and was updated in 2022. It supports a wide range of formats, including DSD, PCM, and MQA, and includes built-in network streaming functionality. With a market price of approximately 34,000 USD, it is positioned in the highest price tier of the DAC market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Measurement data from Stereophile magazine shows an exceptionally low THD+N of 0.00026% (at 1kHz, 6V output). Channel separation is maintained at over 115dB below 10kHz, and self-noise is suppressed to a very low level. These figures significantly exceed the "transparent level" criteria in our review policy (THD 0.01% or lower, crosstalk -70dB or lower), enabling sound reproduction that is ideal for human hearing. The frequency response is also flat within the 20Hz-20kHz range, demonstrating high scientific validity in its fidelity to the master source.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The dCS proprietary Ring DAC APEX is an advanced, proprietary technology with a development history spanning over 30 years. Its design, which does not rely on off-the-shelf DAC chips but instead uses discrete components and an FPGA, is unique and its originality can be appreciated. However, given that the latest off-the-shelf DAC chips achieve superior measured performance (e.g., THD+N of 0.00006%) at less than 1/25th the cost, this technology can no longer be said to have an absolute performance advantage. While its uniqueness is acknowledged, its value is relativized by the overall technological standard of the market, making a top-tier rating difficult.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

A comparison is made with the RME ADI-2 DAC FS (market price approx. 1,300 USD), which offers comparable features and superior measured performance (THD+N 0.00016%). Based on the formula "1,300 USD รท 34,000 USD = 0.038...", the cost-performance score rounds to 0.0. Furthermore, products like the Topping D90 III Sabre (approx. 899 USD, THD+N 0.00006%) exist, offering even better measured performance at a lower price. These facts demonstrate that sound quality reproduction equivalent or superior to the Rossini DAC is achievable at a significantly lower cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Established in 1987, dCS is a specialist British manufacturer with a long track record in professional digital audio equipment. An official distribution and support network is in place in major markets. The long-term, continuous development of the Ring DAC technology ensures high technical stability, and the company provides support for existing products, such as the APEX upgrade. However, as an ultra-high-end product, repair costs can be substantial, which means it does not reach the highest industry standard in this regard.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The dCS design philosophy is scientific in its pursuit of improved measured performance. However, the choice to adhere to an extremely high-cost proprietary technology, when alternative technologies can achieve equivalent or better performance at less than 1/25th the cost, is severely lacking in economic rationality. A product's value is determined by the balance between performance and cost, and there appears to be no rational justification for its final price point. While a philosophy of "pursuing the best" should not be dismissed, a design that incurs such costs for functionality that can be replaced by commodity technology cannot be rated as rational.

## Advice

The dCS Rossini APEX DAC is a product for enthusiasts who find special value in the brand's prestige, the pride of ownership, or the specific sound signature of the Ring DAC. For those purely seeking faithful reproduction of the master source, this product is not a rational choice. Products with equivalent or superior measured performance are available for less than 1/25th the price, and reallocating that significant cost difference to speakers or room acoustics would yield far greater improvements in sound quality. If you are considering this DAC, we recommend you fully understand that its price is a premium for brand value and philosophy, and make a calm decision based on objective performance metrics.
