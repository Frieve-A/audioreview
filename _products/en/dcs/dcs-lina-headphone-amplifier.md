## Overview

The dCS Lina Headphone Amplifier is the first standalone headphone amplifier from the established British digital audio manufacturer dCS, announced in 2022. Based on technology developed for their acclaimed Bartók Headphone DAC, it features a newly designed Class AB amplifier circuit delivering 1.85W@32Ω output with a low output impedance of under 1.0Ω. Priced at 9,750 USD (approximately 1,463,000 JPY), it represents the company's entry into the ultra-high-end headphone amplifier market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

According to Hi-Fi News measurements, the unit demonstrates excellent THD+N (under 0.0005%) and frequency response (±0.1dB from 20Hz-20kHz), meeting the "transparent level" criteria in our measurement benchmark table for these metrics. However, the amplifier section's S/N ratio is 96.2dB, which, while not problematic, falls short of the transparent level (105dB or higher). Although many aspects of its performance are excellent and pose no significant audible issues, the score is reduced because not all performance metrics are ideal. The extremely low output impedance is beneficial for maintaining signal transparency with a wide variety of headphones.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The proprietary Super Class AB circuit design achieves both high linearity and efficiency. Technical improvements are evident, including an increased output from the previous Bartók's 1.4W to 1.85W@32Ω. However, this falls within the realm of relatively conventional analog amplification technology, rather than the digital signal processing expertise the company is known for, limiting its innovation. The hand assembly and rigorous quality control in Cambridge, UK, are commendable, but the circuit design itself does not reach industry-leading standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Comparing it to the Schiit Midgard (219 USD), which offers equivalent or superior measurement performance, the CP = 219 USD ÷ 9,750 USD = 0.022. The Schiit Midgard significantly exceeds the dCS Lina with 4.8W@32Ω output while matching or surpassing other measurement parameters. Additionally, products like the Topping A90 Discrete (around 500 USD) also provide equivalent or superior performance, making the dCS Lina's price approximately 45 times that of the most affordable equivalent product.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

dCS, founded in 1987, has over 30 years of extensive manufacturing experience. With a 3-year warranty, hand assembly in the UK, and a comprehensive support infrastructure, its reliability and support exceed industry average standards. The company maintains manufacturing records and service histories, enabling long-term support capabilities. However, some emerging manufacturers offer 5-year warranties, preventing this from reaching the highest standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design philosophy prioritizing faithful music reproduction, as indicated by their "Only The Music" brand tagline, is rational. The emphasis on measurement data and a scientific approach to product development is also commendable. However, with existing technology capable of achieving equivalent measurement performance at 1/45th the price, the necessity of a dedicated device priced at 9,750 USD is extremely questionable, raising significant doubts about its rationality.

## Advice

While the dCS Lina Headphone Amplifier certainly delivers excellent performance in many areas, it is not recommended from a cost-effectiveness perspective. Equivalent or superior audio quality can be achieved with the Schiit Midgard (219 USD) or the Topping A90 Discrete (around 500 USD). With a 9,750 USD budget, one could acquire a combination of a high-performance headphone amplifier, multiple top-tier headphones, room acoustic treatment, or even a high-quality speaker system, all of which would provide an incomparably greater contribution to audio quality. Unless there is an extreme devotion to the dCS brand, this choice cannot be considered rational.
