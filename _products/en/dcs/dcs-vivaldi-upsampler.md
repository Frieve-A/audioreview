summary: "While showcasing dCS's high technical capabilities, this flagship upsampler's core function lacks scientific validity. With equivalent functionality available at 1/76th the price, its existence as a dedicated device is questionable."

## Overview

The dCS Vivaldi Upsampler is a flagship digital-to-digital converter developed by Cambridge-based dCS (Data Conversion Systems) in the UK. Founded in 1987, dCS began with high-precision ADC/DAC development for military and telecommunications applications and is known for its proprietary Ring DAC technology as an established company that has received The Queen's Award for Enterprise. This product integrates upsampling functions supporting PCM, DSD, and DXD, along with network streaming capabilities for Roon, TIDAL, Spotify, and other services, representing dCS's technical culmination.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

While the dCS Vivaldi system (Upsampler + DAC) demonstrates extremely excellent measurement values as a combination, this is primarily due to the performance of the Vivaldi DAC section. The core function of this product, the upsampling process itself, has no scientifically proven auditory benefits and no confirmed sound quality improvements beyond a placebo effect. Modern high-performance DACs already achieve sufficient fidelity to the master source through their internal processing, making external upsampling by a dedicated device an inaudible difference. Therefore, the effects produced by this product cannot be considered a meaningful improvement for human hearing, making its scientific validity score almost non-existent.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

dCS's technical capabilities deserve a high evaluation. Their high-precision conversion technology, cultivated in the military and telecommunications fields and exemplified by the proprietary Ring DAC, is top-tier in the industry. The FPGA-based digital signal processing, high-precision clock circuits, galvanically-isolated boards, and extensive digital I/O (AES/EBU, S/PDIF, SDIF-2, etc.) implemented in this unit are proof of the company's high design capabilities. However, the direction in which these advanced technologies are applied is not toward audibly meaningful improvements but rather the pursuit of specifications that challenge measurement limits. This score is purely an evaluation of technical potential.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The price is extremely high at 25,000 USD (approximately 3,750,000 JPY). This product is a pure upsampler and requires a separate DAC. As a comparison, the WiiM Ultra (329 USD/approximately 49,350 JPY) is a streamer with a built-in DAC, providing equivalent network streaming functions (Roon Ready, TIDAL, Spotify Connect), upsampling processing, and final analog output. The calculation is "49,350 JPY รท 3,750,000 JPY = 0.0132", making the Vivaldi Upsampler approximately 76 times more expensive than a product with equivalent functionality. There is no rational justification for investing 3.75 million JPY in pure digital processing, making its cost-performance nonexistent.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

dCS is an established company with 37 years of history since its 1987 founding, and its track record in military and telecommunications fields proves its reliability. The 3-year parts and labor warranty, along with manual assembly and inspection systems at its Cambridge headquarters, are commendable. However, compared to the network streamer field dominated by emerging companies, its firmware update frequency and responsiveness to cloud services may be inferior. Additionally, high repair costs typical of expensive products and short parts supply periods are concerning factors. While the company's reliability is high, considering the rapid pace of technological advancement in digital equipment, the risk of obsolescence during long-term use is unavoidable.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The very existence of the dedicated upsampler product category is fundamentally questionable. The practice of developing and selling an expensive standalone component for a function with dubious scientific validity is out of step with modern audio technology trends and is irrational. Equivalent or superior functionality can be achieved at a much lower cost with affordable integrated products like the WiiM Ultra or a combination of a PC and a high-performance DAC. The design philosophy of this product, which pursues only minute improvements in measurements while ignoring viable alternatives for users, lacks rationality.

## Advice

We do not recommend purchasing this product. We strongly advise trying the WiiM Ultra (49,350 JPY) first. As a DAC-integrated streamer, it delivers most of the functions offered by this unit at 1/76th the price and provides more than sufficient performance for the vast majority of users. If you have a budget of 3.75 million JPY, combining the WiiM Ultra with a high-performance DAC (e.g., RME ADI-2 Pro FS R) and a high-end speaker system will achieve far greater improvements in sound quality. The purchase of a Vivaldi Upsampler is only rational for an extremely limited niche of wealthy users who already own a full Vivaldi stack and are willing to pay any price for minuscule improvements in measurements.
