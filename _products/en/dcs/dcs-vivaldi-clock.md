## Overview

The dCS Vivaldi Clock is a master clock generator for digital audio systems developed by the UK-based company dCS. Designed as part of its Vivaldi series, its purpose is to supply a reference clock signal to other components like DACs, upsamplers, and transports for synchronization. It features dual VCXOs (Voltage-Controlled Crystal Oscillators) and claims a clock accuracy of less than ±1 ppm. With an actual market price of approximately 19533 USD, it is positioned in the highest price tier of the audio market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The scientific validity of this product is limited. Modern high-performance DACs achieve sufficiently low jitter performance on their own, thanks to their internal clocks placed in close proximity to the DAC chip and Asynchronous Sample Rate Conversion (ASRC) technology. Therefore, supplying an external clock to a standalone DAC may not provide any audibly meaningful improvement, and some even point to the possibility of degradation due to the added complexity of the signal path. dCS has not published objective data such as jitter measurements or phase noise characteristics, making it difficult to scientifically verify its effectiveness. This stands in contrast to competing products that do publish specific performance values.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The technology level is rated as high standard. It incorporates advanced design elements for a master clock generator, including a dual VCXO design, temperature compensation, eight independently buffered outputs, and support for multiple clock frequencies. Consideration for mechanical stability through its aerospace-grade aluminum chassis and damping panels is also evident. However, it does not stand out in terms of technological innovation or originality when compared to the rubidium atomic clock used in the more affordable Antelope 10MX, or the custom-made, ultra-low phase noise OCXO in the Mutec REF10 SE120.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The cost-performance is unconscionably low. While this product is priced at approximately 19533 USD, the **Gustard C18**, which offers equivalent or superior functionality and claims excellent phase noise specifications, is available for about 1600 USD. The cost-performance value is calculated as "1600 USD / 19533 USD ≈ 0.08," resulting in a score of 0.1. This implies that over 90% of the functional value offered by the Vivaldi Clock is not reflected in its price. Given the existence of an alternative that achieves objective performance at a much lower cost, this pricing is strikingly irrational.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

dCS has a long-standing reputation in the high-end audio industry, and its product quality control and support systems are of a high standard. In Japan, support is provided by an official distributor, and warranty and repair systems are well-established. However, this is a standard level of service for a product in this price range and does not include any special warranties or services that would justify the price. While reliability above the industry average can be expected, the score remains a standard high rating.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The rationality of the design philosophy must be rated as extremely low. The primary role of a master clock is to "synchronize" the operation of multiple digital devices. When connected to a single DAC, its purpose is virtually non-existent. Modern, well-designed DACs are built to perform at their best without an external clock. The very concept of a standalone, high-priced clock with a dedicated chassis and power supply, like this product, runs counter to the advancements in modern digital audio technology. It is difficult to find a rational reason for its existence beyond satisfying a strong commitment to the dCS brand and system unification.

## Advice

We do not recommend purchasing this product. An investment of approximately 19533 USD is extremely inefficient from a sound quality improvement perspective. If you have a similar budget, we strongly advise allocating it to upgrading your speakers or to professional room acoustic measurement and treatment. These factors will yield an audible improvement that is incomparably greater than changing a clock. Even if you have a strong desire to unify your system with dCS components, you cannot expect an objective improvement in sound quality commensurate with this investment. You should first seriously consider trying a much cheaper, high-performance product like the Gustard C18, or question whether an external clock is necessary at all.
