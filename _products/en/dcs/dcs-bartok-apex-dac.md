## Overview

The dCS Bartók APEX DAC is a streaming DAC developed by the UK-based high-end audio manufacturer dCS. It is centered around the company's proprietary Ring DAC technology, with performance enhancements from the 2023 APEX upgrade. This product integrates four functions—DAC, streamer, preamplifier, and headphone amplifier—with the headphone-equipped model priced at 24200 USD. It stands as one of the company's iconic products, incorporating technology cultivated in the professional audio field.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The APEX upgrade improves the linearity of the Ring DAC, achieving low distortion. The headphone amplifier also provides sufficient output with 1.4W into a 33Ω load. However, third-party measurements show that its SINAD (Signal-to-Noise and Distortion Ratio) is limited to about 112dB at best, with a noticeable difference of about 6dB between the left and right channels. This falls short of the 120dB+ SINAD values achieved by more affordable competitors, offering no superiority in measurements. Furthermore, depending on the filter settings, the frequency response begins to roll off in the high frequencies (around 17kHz), failing to achieve complete flatness across the entire audible band. While it comes close to transparent performance on many metrics, its degree of scientific performance is limited when considering the price.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The proprietary Ring DAC, constructed from discrete components without reliance on off-the-shelf DAC chips, showcases dCS's technical capabilities. The APEX upgrade involved redesigning the circuit board and renewing the analog output stage to enhance performance. This dedication to a unique architecture and its implementation is highly commendable. However, the modern approach主流 involves using general-purpose DAC chips or FPGAs to achieve equivalent or superior measured performance (especially SINAD) at a lower cost. This cost-prohibitive proprietary technology cannot be considered the best approach today, and its technical superiority is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The model with a headphone amplifier is extremely expensive at 24200 USD. Meanwhile, products with equivalent or superior functionality and measured performance exist at a fraction of the price. For example, the RME ADI-2 DAC FS (approx. 1233 USD), which offers superior measured performance as a DAC, preamp, and headphone amp, can be paired with an inexpensive streamer (approx. 200 USD). This combination, totaling around 1433 USD, can replace all functions of the Bartók APEX. The cost-performance calculation is `1433 USD ÷ 24200 USD ≒ 0.059`, which rounds to an evaluation of 0.1. The economic rationality is virtually nonexistent.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Established in 1987, dCS has a strong track record in the pro audio industry, and its product reliability is highly regarded. It offers a comprehensive warranty, a global support network, and continuous firmware updates. The provision of a paid APEX upgrade (approx. 6000 USD) for existing users demonstrates a commitment to long-term product support. However, this level of support is standard for products in this price range and does not represent a significant competitive advantage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The development approach of the APEX upgrade, which aims for improved measured performance, is scientific in itself. However, the adherence to proprietary technology to achieve this goal, resulting in a price tag of over 24200 USD while having aspects of its measured performance fall short of products costing around 1433 USD, casts serious doubt on the rationality of its design philosophy. From the perspective of pure audio fidelity, it is an extremely inefficient and cost-imbalanced approach. When evaluated purely as a technical product, excluding brand value and craftsmanship, it is difficult to rationally justify its existence.

## Advice

While the dCS Bartók APEX DAC may satisfy a technical curiosity, it lacks the objective performance to match its price. Its purchase is not recommended at all. There is no justifiable reason for the price difference of over 22767 USD, other than a strong attachment to the brand. Numerous alternatives exist that offer equivalent or superior functionality and better-measured performance. For instance, a combination like the RME ADI-2 DAC FS (approx. 1233 USD) and a Wiim Pro Plus (approx. 200 USD) provides an experience that surpasses the Bartók APEX in every aspect for a total of about 1433 USD. Even for those seeking the best possible measurements without regard to cost, other more affordable options are more rational. Unless you find special value in the dCS brand and design, this product should be avoided.
