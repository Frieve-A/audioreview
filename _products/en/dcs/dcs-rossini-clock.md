summary: "The dCS Rossini Clock is a high-precision master clock, but its benefits are unproven and unnecessary in modern audio systems. Compared to products with equivalent functionality, it is remarkably expensive and offers virtually no cost-performance."

## Overview

The dCS Rossini Clock is a Grade 1 master clock generator developed by UK-based dCS Ltd. It claims to achieve high-precision clock output of ±0.1ppm (typical) through dual crystal oscillators with microcontroller-controlled temperature compensation. The multi-stage PLL (Phase-Locked-Loop) system is designed to suppress jitter and is optimized for use with the dCS Rossini series. With a US market price of approximately 18,000 USD, it is an extremely expensive product.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

While this product provides measurable jitter reduction, this is an unnecessary function for any competently designed modern DAC. The internal PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) circuits in today's DACs are already more than capable of suppressing incoming jitter. Therefore, the claim that adding an even more precise external clock leads to audible improvements in sound quality has not been substantiated by blind testing. Except for professional studio environments where synchronizing multiple digital devices is necessary, the scientific validity of this product as a means of improving sound quality in a typical home audio setup is virtually nonexistent.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The technical implementation itself is of a high standard. The temperature compensation system for the dual crystal oscillators demonstrates design originality. Professional-grade features are employed, including three independent buffer outputs, 75Ω BNC connectors, and an auto-clocking function. Furthermore, the physical countermeasures, such as the aerospace-grade aluminum chassis and vibration damping panels, represent a robust build, albeit at a very high cost. However, these are technologies for generating a high-precision clock signal; whether that signal contributes to improved audio quality is a separate issue.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The cost-performance is remarkably poor. Compared to the Mutec MC-3+USB (approx. 1,400 USD), which offers equivalent clocking functions, the performance is less than 1/12th the price. The calculation is "1,400 USD ÷ 18,000 USD = 0.078," resulting in a score of 0.1. The Mutec MC-3+USB provides practically equivalent or superior functions, including ±0.1ppm accuracy and USB input support. Other far cheaper alternatives like the Grimm Audio CC1 and Antelope 10MX also exist, and there are no factors that can justify this product's price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

dCS, founded in 1987, is a UK manufacturer with a proven track record in the professional market, suggesting high basic reliability. The product comes with a 2-year warranty and is supported by authorized dealers. The failure rate is considered low compared to general audio equipment, and it is designed for long-term use. However, for a product in this price range, the 2-year warranty is short compared to competitors who offer longer terms, thus it does not receive a perfect score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

While the goal of generating a high-precision clock is clear, the underlying premise that this goal leads to improved sound quality in a modern, typical audio playback environment lacks scientific rationality. Advances in DAC technology have rendered the importance of external master clocks a thing of the past. The idea of spending over 18,000 USD on a single-function clock that does not directly handle the music signal is profoundly irrational from a cost-effectiveness standpoint. This approach is akin to applying an extremely expensive "solution" to a problem that has already been solved.

## Advice

Under no circumstances can we recommend the purchase of the dCS Rossini Clock. Its price of 18,000 USD is not only irrational for an audio product but also its contribution to sound quality is not scientifically expected. Even if you are considering an external clock, you should first reconsider the necessity itself. In a modern audio system, an external clock is a redundant accessory. We strongly recommend investing that budget in areas that genuinely have a significant impact on sound quality, such as upgrading speakers or improving room acoustics.
