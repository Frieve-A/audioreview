## Overview

The dCS Rossini Apex DAC is a flagship-class digital-to-analog converter developed by the British luxury audio manufacturer dCS. It incorporates the latest APEX upgrade to the company's proprietary Ring DAC technology, achieving further performance improvements over the conventional Rossini DAC. Designed as a pure DAC-dedicated device, it features high-resolution playback capabilities supporting DSD11.2MHz and PCM768kHz/32bit, along with industry-leading measurement performance. The actual market price in Japan is approximately 6.5 million yen, positioning it in the highest price tier of the DAC market. The Ring DAC APEX technology, perfected through over 30 years of technical development, achieves linearity improvements of more than 12dB compared to previous models.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The APEX upgrade achieves an extremely excellent THD+N value of 0.00020% (1kHz, full scale). It maintains an SNR above 115dB, channel separation above 115dB, and achieves crosstalk below -110dB. These measurement values significantly exceed the standards for what is considered a "transparent level," a threshold beyond which improvements are inaudible to the human ear. The frequency response falls within ±0.3dB across 20Hz-20kHz, and the dynamic range also exceeds 115dB. The 12dB linearity improvement from the APEX upgrade is clearly confirmed in measurements, demonstrating high scientific validity in fidelity to master sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The dCS proprietary Ring DAC APEX technology represents an industry-leading design perfected through over 30 years of continuous development. Rather than using commercial DAC chips, it employs a completely in-house designed differential structure, achieving more than an order of magnitude (officially over 12dB) improvement in linearity compared to previous versions through the renewal of critical components in the analog output stage and a complete redesign of the main circuit board. Extremely low output impedance values of 2 ohms balanced and 1 ohm unbalanced minimize cable influence. It achieves industry-leading technical implementation in digital signal processing with 768kHz/32bit PCM and DSD11.2MHz support, plus six PCM filter selection options. This technology demonstrates originality in the industry and shows high technical achievement directly linked to measurable performance improvements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Compared to the Topping D70 Pro Octo (599 USD), which shows superior measurement performance with THD+N 0.00007% and SNR 134dB versus the dCS Rossini Apex DAC (THD+N 0.00020%, SNR 115dB). The D70 Pro Octo provides equivalent or superior functionality and excellent measurement performance with eight CS43198 chips, PCM768kHz/32bit, and DSD512 support, while costing approximately 1/70th the price. Cost-performance calculation: 600 USD ÷ 43333 USD = 0.0138, which rounds to 0.0. This demonstrates that technically equivalent or superior sound quality reproduction is achievable at a significantly lower cost, resulting in an extremely harsh evaluation from a pure performance-to-price ratio perspective.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

dCS is a British specialist manufacturer established in 1987 with a long track record in professional digital audio equipment. Adoption by the BBC and mastering studios validates its reliability, and there is an appropriate warranty system through authorized dealers in Japan. Technical stability is high due to over 30 years of continuous Ring DAC technology development, and they provide technical support for existing products, such as APEX upgrades. Firmware update support and a global service network are well-established, positioning it at high industry standards. However, repair costs may be expensive due to the ultra-luxury nature of the product, preventing it from reaching industry-leading standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

dCS's design approach is scientific, emphasizing measurable performance improvements. The achievement of low distortion and low noise through Ring DAC APEX technology represents a rational direction directly linked to auditory sound quality improvement. However, with alternative means existing to achieve equivalent or superior measurement performance at approximately 1/70th the cost, the rationality of this pricing is highly questionable. The justification for such a dedicated audio device is weakened when more efficient technical approaches can provide alternatives, and its design philosophy cannot be highly rated, especially from an economic rationality perspective.

## Advice

The dCS Rossini Apex DAC certainly demonstrates excellent measurement performance, but extremely careful judgment is necessary when considering a purchase. Given the reality that equivalent or superior measurement performance can be achieved with the Topping D70 Pro Octo at approximately 1/70th the cost, one should objectively consider whether there is added value commensurate with this price difference. The D70 Pro Octo achieves excellent figures of THD+N 0.00007% and SNR 134dB through eight CS43198 chips, with no inferiority in functionality. Apart from cases where brand value or the desire for ownership is prioritized, for a pure sound quality improvement purpose, we strongly recommend first trying the D70 Pro Octo. Additionally, with a price of 6.5 million yen, an investment in the entire system beyond the DAC (speakers, amplifiers, room acoustic treatment) could potentially bring far greater sound quality improvement effects, which is an important consideration. Make optimal equipment choices through rational judgment based on measurement data.
