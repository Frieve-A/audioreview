## Overview

The Onkyo TX-8250 is a network stereo receiver released in 2017, rated up to 135 W/ch (6 Ω, 1 kHz, 1% THD, IEC) and designed to bridge traditional hi-fi amplification with modern connectivity. It integrates Chromecast built-in, AirPlay (upgraded to AirPlay 2 via firmware), DTS Play-Fi, dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, phono input, USB, and multiple digital inputs. An AK4452VN DAC handles digital conversion, and the discrete power stage follows Onkyo's WRAT approach. The model has since been discontinued, with availability varying by region. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate THD+N of 0.08% (20 Hz-20 kHz, half power) and a line-input SNR of 106 dB (IHF-A, Direct), both consistent with audibly transparent operation for typical use. Frequency response extends to 10 Hz-100 kHz (+1/-3 dB, Direct), comfortably exceeding audible bandwidth. Independent third-party bench data are not publicly available, so the score starts from 0.5 (unknown) and is adjusted modestly upward (+0.1) based on comprehensive, conservative specs. [1][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a 2017 design, the TX-8250 implements then-mainstream technologies (Chromecast built-in, AirPlay/Play-Fi, dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, AKM delta-sigma DAC) without novel architectures or DSP advances seen in newer platforms. Functional coverage remains strong, but technical sophistication is now below average relative to current models. [3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current reference price for the TX-8250 is 430 USD. The cheapest broadly available US alternative we verified is Denon's DRA-800H at 399 USD (100 W/ch, HEOS, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth) – however, it lacks Chromecast built-in. Adding a WiiM Pro streamer (Chromecast built-in; 149 USD list) to match core user-facing functions brings that system to 548 USD, which is higher than the TX-8250. On measured specs, DRA-800H does not exceed TX-8250 across the board (e.g., SNR 98 dB vs. 106 dB for TX-8250; both claim ≤0.08% THD), so no cheaper equal-or-better option exists as of the review date. Therefore, CP = 1.0. [1][4][5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Onkyo's corporate turbulence and product discontinuation lower confidence in long-term parts availability and service coverage. That said, the TX-8250 received meaningful post-launch firmware support – including AirPlay 2 in 2019 and a maintenance update in 2024 – and originally shipped with a typical 2-year warranty. Hardware construction is straightforward and robust, but network features depend on ongoing software support that is no longer assured. [2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design prioritizes measurable fidelity and practical connectivity (phono, digital, network multi-room) over boutique concepts, achieving transparent-class specs and broad ecosystem support at modest cost. It lacks cutting-edge innovation, but its choices are scientifically grounded and cost-effective. [1][3]

## Advice

If you need a transparent, network-ready stereo receiver with Chromecast built-in and phono, the TX-8250 remains a strong value where still available. For new-model shopping, pairing a current stereo receiver (e.g., Denon DRA-800H) with an external Chromecast-capable streamer (e.g., WiiM Pro) can replicate functions – but usually at a higher total price. We recommend confirming local service support before purchase and budgeting for an external streamer only if you specifically require Chromecast.
