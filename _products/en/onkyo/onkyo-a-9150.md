rating: [2.5, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.3, 0.4]
price: 599
summary: "Entry-class integrated amplifier (2017) with AKM DAC (AK4452), 4×digital inputs, and discrete MM/MC phono stage. Clean SNR but amp THD is not at today’s transparent level; overall value is challenged by cheaper modern Class-D bundles."

## Overview

The A-9150 is a 2017 integrated stereo amplifier that combines a discrete analog power stage with an **AKM AK4452** DAC and a rare **MM/MC** phono stage on a dedicated board. Official specs include **60 W/ch (4 Ω, 20 Hz–20 kHz, 0.08% THD, two channels driven, FTC)**, **SNR 107 dB (line, A-weighted)**, **10 Hz–100 kHz / +1 dB, −3 dB** frequency response (Direct), and **4× digital inputs (2 optical, 2 coax)** up to **192 kHz/24-bit**; the DAC section is **AK4452 768 kHz/32-bit** [1][2]. The model is discontinued; brand ownership/support has been restructured under Gentex via VOXX/Premium Audio Company in 2025 [3][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Audibility-relevant catalog numbers: power amp **THD+N 0.08% (20 Hz–20 kHz at rated power)** and **SNR 107 dB (line, A-weighted)** [1][2]. The SNR is comfortably transparent, but **0.08% THD** sits above the ~0.01% “transparency” line typical of recent well-measuring integrateds, so we treat fidelity as **intermediate**. Phono stages are **MM 82 dB / MC 73 dB (A-weighted)** [2]. No independent bench data was located; therefore we keep the **scientific validity baseline at 0.5 and add +0.1** for complete, test-conditioned manufacturer specs (load/bandwidth noted) [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Onkyo’s discrete **SpectraModule** front-end (claimed slew rate >500 V/µs) and a proper **MM/MC** phono board are thoughtful, but the overall platform reflects **2017-era class-AB** thinking. Versus 2024–2025 Class-D integrateds with modern DACs/USB, DSP, and lower distortion at lower cost, this is solid but not cutting-edge [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better bundle):**  
**SMSL AO300** integrated (USB/optical/coax/HDMI-ARC DAC, published **THD+N ~0.003%**, **SNR ~107 dB**) **+ AIYIMA T3 PRO** **MM/MC** phono preamp. The AO300 covers and exceeds A-9150’s digital I/O and DAC features; T3 PRO restores the **MC** capability missing on most budget integrateds. Representative US prices at writing: **AO300 289 USD** (Aoshida), **T3 PRO 99.99 USD** (official store). Together they provide **equal (or better) functions** and **strictly better published distortion** [5][6][7].

**CP calculation (explicit):**  
**388.99 USD ÷ 599 USD = 0.649… → 0.6** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**A-9150 is discontinued.** Onkyo brand stewardship shifted under **Gentex** through the VOXX/Premium Audio Company group in 2025, after Onkyo’s 2022 bankruptcy events; for an older integrated, that means **uncertain long-term parts/repair continuity** even if brand-level support exists today [3][4]. We score reliability/support below average on this basis.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A conventional class-AB amplifier with a quality analog phono board is rational, but **the cost-to-performance ratio versus modern Class-D/DSP solutions is no longer favorable**. No claims of non-audible “tweaks,” but also no measurable-performance leap that would justify higher spend in 2025 [1][2].

## Advice

If you specifically need an **integrated** with **multiple digital inputs** plus a **built-in MC-capable** phono solution in a full-width chassis, a clean A-9150 can still serve well. Otherwise, for **measurement-first value**, the **AO300 + T3 PRO** bundle offers wider digital connectivity and lower published distortion for **~65% of the A-9150’s price** in the US, while keeping phono **MM/MC** capability [5][7]. For buyers prioritizing **new-unit warranty and support**, prefer currently manufactured integrateds with published measurements.
