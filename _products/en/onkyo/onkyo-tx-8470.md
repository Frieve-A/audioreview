## Overview

The Onkyo TX-8470 is a dedicated two-channel Hi-Fi network stereo receiver delivering 110W per channel through Class G amplification technology. The unit features an AKM 32-bit/768kHz DAC, comprehensive connectivity including 4 HDMI inputs with 8K/60Hz support, built-in network streaming capabilities, and both MM/MC phono preamp functionality. At 799 USD MSRP, it positions itself as a contemporary stereo receiver combining traditional Hi-Fi amplification with modern digital connectivity and streaming features.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurements reveal mixed performance results across key specifications. Line input achieves 101 dB S/N ratio approaching transparent levels, while digital input provides 98 dB. Power output measurements show 126W into 8Ω and 177W into 4Ω, exceeding manufacturer specifications [1]. THD+N at 1W measures 0.02%, indicating good low-power distortion performance. However, MC phono performance is only 55 dB S/N ratio, well below both the 80 dB problematic threshold and typical MC phono stage specifications (commonly 75–80 dB or higher), severely limiting usability with moving coil cartridges. MM phono achieves 81 dB, within the typical range for integrated MM inputs and just above the problematic threshold. While line and digital input measurements approach transparent performance, the critical MC phono deficiency represents a fundamental limitation that prevents higher evaluation, as this performance level makes the unit unsuitable for high-quality analog playback with low-output cartridges.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The TX-8470 incorporates solid contemporary technology with some proprietary elements. Class G amplification provides power efficiency while maintaining audio quality, representing appropriate current-generation technology. The AKM AK4452 DAC supports DSD256 and up to 768kHz PCM, meeting modern high-resolution audio requirements. HDMI (4 inputs, 1 output) supports 8K/60Hz and 4K/120Hz pass-through with up to 40Gbps bandwidth per manufacturer specifications. Onkyo's patented discrete op-amp circuitry for the phono stage and isolated phono board design demonstrate proprietary technical development. The dedicated two-channel design philosophy shows focused engineering optimization rather than generic multi-channel platform adaptation. While not representing breakthrough innovation, the technology implementation demonstrates solid contemporary engineering with meaningful proprietary contributions.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 799 USD, equivalence requires 8K-capable HDMI (4+ inputs), network streaming (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, AirPlay 2 or Chromecast), MM/MC phono preamp, and measured performance at least on par (e.g. line S/N near or above transparent threshold, sub-0.1% THD). Receivers with 8K and network streaming but MM-only phono (e.g. Denon DRA-900H) do not meet the MM/MC requirement and cannot be used as the CP comparator. No cheaper product was identified that meets all of these requirements; 4K-only receivers do not offer equivalent video capability. The review target is the cheapest option among equivalent-or-better alternatives. CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Onkyo provides standard warranty coverage for defects in materials and workmanship, excluding normal wear and commercial use. Repairs are performed exclusively through authorized independent service centers rather than direct manufacturer support, with locations available via website or customer support contact. The service infrastructure relies on third-party authorized centers rather than direct manufacturer repair facilities, potentially extending repair turnaround times. Historical context includes Onkyo's acknowledgment of network chip failures in receivers manufactured between 2009 and 2012, requiring extended warranty coverage through 2018. While not directly applicable to current generation, this history indicates previous reliability challenges with network components. The combination of indirect service support and historical reliability issues suggests below-average reliability and support compared to manufacturers offering direct service infrastructure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Onkyo's design philosophy demonstrates mixed scientific and subjective elements. The company emphasizes engineering-driven approaches with measurement focus and "perfecting the basics" while minimizing unnecessary features. However, marketing language incorporates subjective concepts like "musicality," "emotion," and "sound harmony" without clear scientific verification. The dedicated two-channel design represents rational optimization for stereo applications rather than compromised multi-channel platform adaptation. Class G amplification adoption shows practical efficiency considerations. Contemporary technology integration including HDMI 2.1 and modern DAC implementation demonstrates progressive engineering. The emphasis on premium parts selection and discrete circuitry may not directly correlate with measurable performance improvements over general-purpose components. The approach balances scientific measurement considerations with traditional Hi-Fi subjective elements, resulting in moderate rationality scoring.

## Advice

The TX-8470 suits users requiring comprehensive connectivity in a dedicated stereo receiver format, particularly those prioritizing network streaming integration with traditional Hi-Fi functionality and 8K video pass-through. At 799 USD, it ranks as the cheapest option among receivers with equivalent functionality (8K HDMI, MM/MC phono, network streaming). Users who do not need 8K may find 4K-only stereo receivers at lower prices. Potential buyers should avoid MC cartridge use due to poor phono stage performance, with the 55 dB S/N ratio falling well below acceptable levels for high-quality analog playback. Users prioritizing pure measured performance may find better options in separate components, while those requiring multi-channel capability should consider AV receivers.
