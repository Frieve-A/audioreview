## Overview

The Onkyo DAC-HA200 is a compact portable digital-to-analog converter and headphone amplifier originally launched in 2015 at 149 USD. Measuring 64×112×21.7mm and weighing 210g, the aluminum-bodied device features a Burr-Brown PCM5102 DAC chip, MUSES 8920 op-amp, and discrete Class AB push-pull output stage. It supports up to 96kHz/24-bit audio via multiple inputs including USB (PC/Mac), USB-A (Android AOA 2.0), optical, and 3.5mm analog. The built-in 2100mAh lithium-ion battery provides 8-11 hours of operation. The device has been discontinued from retail and is now available only through used markets at significantly reduced prices.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The DAC-HA200's manufacturer specifications show promising distortion performance with THD of 0.003% or less at 32Ω load, which achieves the transparent level threshold below 0.01% [2]. Output power specifications of 145mW at 32Ω and 60mW at 300Ω provide adequate drive capability for most headphones. The frequency response specification of 10Hz-100kHz demonstrates wide bandwidth coverage. However, critical measurements including S/N ratio, dynamic range, and crosstalk specifications are absent from manufacturer documentation, preventing comprehensive performance assessment. No credible third-party measurements are available to verify manufacturer claims or provide key missing specifications. Applying conservative evaluation for missing third-party verification and incomplete specification documentation, the scientific validity remains limited despite promising individual measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The DAC-HA200 employs standard industry components without significant proprietary innovation. The Burr-Brown PCM5102 DAC chip supports up to 32-bit/384kHz processing capability, but the device implementation is designed for 96kHz/24-bit operation as specified [2]. The MUSES 8920 op-amp and discrete Class AB output stage represent conventional 2013-era design approaches that were appropriate for their time but lack modern advancements. The device provides multiple input options and includes software bundling (HD Player pack for iOS) that adds functionality, but the overall technical approach shows limited differentiation from contemporary alternatives. The absence of cutting-edge features like wireless connectivity, advanced DSP processing, or smartphone-level integration reflects the conservative design philosophy of the mid-2010s era.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The DAC-HA200's cost-performance evaluation reflects its current market position as a discontinued product. Based on current used market pricing averaging 65 USD for good condition units, the device faces competition from modern alternatives that provide superior specifications. The FiiO KA11 at 30 USD delivers equivalent DAC and headphone amplification functions with superior technical specifications: Cirrus Logic CS43131 DAC with 32-bit/384kHz support versus 24-bit/96kHz, 245mW output power at 16Ω and 200mW at 32Ω versus 145mW, THD+N below 0.0006% versus 0.003%, and SNR ≥125dB versus unspecified [5]. Both devices provide portable DAC/amplifier functionality with USB compatibility and headphone driving capability. The KA11's superior measured performance specifications establish clear functional equivalence with better technical execution at lower cost. CP = 30 USD ÷ 65 USD = 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The DAC-HA200's reliability profile shows both strengths and weaknesses. The device's analog circuit design with minimal digital processing suggests inherent reliability, while user reports indicate connectivity issues with Android devices despite AOA 2.0 compliance claims [1]. Onkyo's support infrastructure directs users to retailers rather than providing direct manufacturer assistance, which may complicate warranty service. The company's historical quality control issues with network chips in receivers raise additional concerns about overall manufacturing standards. However, the simple analog signal path and robust aluminum construction should provide reasonable long-term durability. The standard warranty period and basic support coverage meet industry norms but offer no particular advantages.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Onkyo's design philosophy for the DAC-HA200 shows mixed rationality from a scientific perspective. The emphasis on "sound harmony" and subjective audio qualities lacks measurement-based justification, reflecting non-scientific marketing approaches. The PCM5102 DAC implementation at 96kHz/24-bit represents the specified operational parameters rather than artificial limitation of higher capabilities [2]. The use of discrete Class AB amplification and MUSES 8920 op-amp shows preference for traditional approaches without clear demonstration of superiority over integrated solutions in measured performance. The inclusion of multiple input options (USB, optical, analog) addresses practical user connectivity needs and represents rational design consideration. However, the overall approach prioritizes conventional audio industry methodologies over cost-effective implementations that modern technology enables, resulting in limited competitive advantage.

## Advice

For potential purchasers considering the DAC-HA200, the current market presents both opportunities and superior alternatives. As a discontinued product available in the used market at approximately 65 USD for good condition units, it may offer reasonable value for users specifically requiring the exact combination of input options (USB, optical, analog) in a portable form factor. However, modern alternatives like the FiiO KA11 at 30 USD provide significantly superior technical specifications with current warranty support. Users prioritizing pure performance and cost-effectiveness would benefit more from current portable DAC/amp solutions that deliver better measured results at lower prices. The DAC-HA200 might appeal to collectors of mid-2010s audio equipment or users requiring legacy connectivity options unavailable in modern devices.
