## Overview

The A-9110 is a two-channel Class AB integrated amplifier that refines the A-9010 with a reinforced 1.6 mm chassis and Onkyo’s WRAT high-current architecture. It offers five analog inputs including an MM phono stage and intentionally omits all digital inputs/DAC to focus on pure analog amplification. Key published specs include FR 10 Hz–100 kHz (+1/−3 dB, Direct), THD+N 0.05% at 1 kHz/8 Ω (half power), damping factor 95 (1 kHz/8 Ω), and SNR 103 dB (line, IHF-A) / 78 dB (phono, IHF-A) [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

No independent bench tests were found at review time, so we provisionally assess using the manufacturer’s specifications. Full-band FTC ratings are 30 W/8 Ω at 0.7% THD and 50 W/4 Ω at 0.9% THD—far from transparent-level distortion. Line-in SNR 103 dB is near but below transparent targets, while phono SNR 78 dB falls short. Frequency response is wide and effectively transparent in Direct mode; damping factor 95 is close to the transparent-target region but not clearly within it. On balance—starting from a neutral 0.5 baseline in the absence of third-party data and deducting for high full-band THD and modest phono SNR—we score **0.3** [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Conventional analog Class AB with low-feedback tuning, WRAT supply, passive parts selection, and a stiffened chassis are competent but mainstream. There’s no DSP/software integration or novel circuit IP that sets a new bar versus contemporary designs [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Denominator (review target price):** 299 USD (new stock observed) [2].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **Sony STR-DH190** stereo receiver at **198 USD**—includes MM phono and multiple analog inputs; documentation lists **90 W × 2 into 8 Ω (20–20 kHz) at 0.09% THD**, indicating equal-or-better user-facing functions and full-band distortion performance [3][4].

**CP (USD basis):** 198 USD ÷ 299 USD = **0.662 → 0.7**（rounded to one decimal）.  
*Equivalence note:* Equipped with MM phono and line inputs; full-band THD and continuous power are equivalent-or-better [3][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Onkyo lists **Amplifier: 2 Years parts & labor** for new units (U.S.) [5]. The A-9110 is an older model with fluctuating availability; TEAC’s official store in Japan has listed new-stock units with a 2-year note [6]. Analog-only design reduces firmware risk, but model age tempers long-term service confidence. Net: slightly above average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Scored from a 0.5 baseline: **(+0.1)** for focusing spend on core analog stages (chassis/bracing, power delivery) that plausibly affect measured outcomes; **(−0.1)** for a conservative direction with no modern DSP/software integration; **(−0.1)** for no clear progression toward transparent-level results versus best-in-class measured designs. No occult claims are observed [1].

## Advice

If you need a simple analog integrated with MM phono and low operational complexity, the A-9110 remains appealing. For buyers optimizing audible transparency or value, the **Sony STR-DH190** delivers comparable functions (plus Bluetooth/FM) with documented lower full-band THD for less money, while recent high-performance Class-D integrateds (with an external phono stage if required) can better approach transparent-level distortion [3][4].
