## Overview

The Onkyo C-711M is a mid-size CD player manufactured from 1993 to 1998, originally retailing for 39,000 Japanese yen. Part of Onkyo's INTEC275 series, this player features 1-bit Delta-Sigma D/A conversion with 8x oversampling at 352.8kHz. The unit includes both fixed and variable analog outputs plus optical digital output, housed in a compact 275×79×308mm chassis weighing 3.1kg. As a discontinued vintage product available only in the used market, it represents 1990s CD player technology with specifications that remain competitive by modern standards.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The C-711M demonstrates solid measured performance based on manufacturer specifications [1]. Frequency response spans 5Hz-20kHz, which fully covers the transparent level requirement of 20Hz-20kHz (±0.5 dB). THD measures 0.005%, better than the 0.01% transparent threshold but not exceptionally superior compared to modern products. Dynamic range (96dB) falls between problematic (90dB) and transparent (105dB) levels, while S/N ratio (100dB) approaches the transparent threshold. Channel separation achieves 90dB at 1kHz, exceeding the -70dB crosstalk requirement. Multiple parameters approach or exceed transparent levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The C-711M employs appropriate 1990s CD player technology with some refinements for its era. The Fine Pulse Conversion System, while conventional oversampling implementation, was properly executed for the time period. The 1-bit Delta-Sigma DAC architecture represented contemporary technology, achieving good measured performance within period constraints. When evaluated against 1990s standards rather than current technology, the design demonstrates competent engineering with solid construction and appropriate component selection for its market position.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market analysis reveals the FiiO DM13 at 155 USD as the cheapest equivalent-or-better CD player. Equipped with CD playback, optical and coaxial digital outputs, and remote control, the DM13 offers superior functionality with dual Cirrus Logic CS43198 DACs, balanced 4.4mm output, and modern USB-C charging. The DM13 provides frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (-0.03dB), THD+N 0.0024% for headphone output and 0.0026% for line output [3][4], and S/N ratio >113dB. Performance specifications exceed the C-711M across measured parameters while adding contemporary features. Current used market price for working C-711M units is approximately 80 USD. Since the C-711M is the world's cheapest equivalent-or-better product, CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a discontinued product from 1993-1998, the C-711M faces significant support limitations. Onkyo ended manufacturer warranty and parts support decades ago, requiring third-party repair services with limited component availability. The simple CD mechanism construction provided adequate reliability for its era, but aging capacitors and laser assemblies present common failure points. Current market availability is limited to used units with unknown service history and no warranty coverage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The C-711M represents Onkyo's 1990s design philosophy emphasizing measurement-focused sound quality improvements [2]. The approach prioritized achieving good measured performance through careful analog circuit design and proper digital filtering implementation. While conservative by current standards, the design philosophy demonstrated rational cost allocation toward functional improvements rather than subjective enhancements. The focus on achieving low distortion and good dynamic range aligned with scientifically meaningful audio quality parameters. However, the design predates modern integration approaches that achieve superior cost-effectiveness through digital signal processing and advanced connectivity.

## Advice

The Onkyo C-711M offers a paradox for potential purchasers. Its measured specifications remain competitive with current CD players, potentially providing excellent audio performance at minimal cost in the used market. However, purchasing decisions must carefully weigh the lack of manufacturer support, parts availability, and warranty coverage against the potential for good sound quality. Buyers should ensure proper functionality testing and consider repair costs when evaluating used units. For users prioritizing measured performance over modern features, working examples may provide exceptional value.
