## Overview

The Onkyo HP-50 are vintage closed-back dynamic headphones manufactured between 1980-1984 according to hifi-wiki.com [1], though some listings suggest 1977. Originally retailing for approximately 90 Deutsche Marks, these headphones represent early consumer audio technology with basic dynamic drivers. Weighing 260 grams with a fixed cable and 6.35mm connector, the HP-50 featured 8-ohm impedance and claimed 20-20,000 Hz frequency response. While historically significant as part of Onkyo's early headphone lineup, they lack the measured performance data of modern alternatives.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The HP-50 provides limited manufacturer specifications (8-ohm impedance, 20-20,000 Hz frequency response, 103 dB/mW sensitivity, 100mW power handling) that are audio-quality-relevant but lack credible third-party measurements for comprehensive evaluation. Given the 1980s era design, these specifications suggest basic audio performance within expected parameters for the period. However, modern headphones achieve superior measured performance in THD, frequency response linearity, and isolation. The conservative evaluation reflects reliance on manufacturer specifications rather than independent verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The HP-50 represents basic 1980s headphone technology with standard dynamic drivers and no proprietary innovations. While Onkyo later developed advanced technologies for their audio equipment, the HP-50 represents basic 1980s headphone design without proprietary innovations. The design uses outdated approaches that modern manufacturers would not specifically adopt, lacks technical differentiation that competitors could not easily replicate, and employs purely analog/mechanical construction without modern digital integration. The technology level reflects its era but offers no advancement or sophistication by current standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Current market pricing for vintage HP-50 units averages 50 USD. The Audio-Technica ATH-M20x at approximately 45 USD provides equivalent-or-better closed-back functionality with superior measured performance. The ATH-M20x delivers 15Hz-20kHz frequency response with flat midrange characteristics, 47-ohm impedance suitable for various devices, and credible third-party measurements showing minimal distortion. Equipped with closed-back design and professional monitoring capabilities, the ATH-M20x offers equivalent user-facing functions with verified superior frequency response linearity and lower distortion measurements. CP = 45 USD รท 50 USD = 0.9.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The HP-50 is a discontinued vintage product with no current warranty or manufacturer support. Parts availability is severely limited for 40+ year old units, and no authorized service infrastructure exists. While the simple analog construction with few electronic components may be inherently reliable, the age factor significantly impacts long-term reliability considerations. Current Onkyo warranty covers personal audio systems for 1 year, but this applies only to current products, not vintage items from the 1980s. Third-party repair services may be available but with limited parts supply.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The HP-50 represents 1980s audio design philosophy that emphasized basic functionality over measured performance optimization. The design does not incorporate modern technologies such as DSP, digital processing, or software integration that could improve measured performance. However, Onkyo's evolution toward measurement-based development demonstrates the company's capacity for rational design philosophy, even if not reflected in this vintage product.

## Advice

The Onkyo HP-50 should be considered primarily as a collectible vintage item rather than a practical listening solution. For actual audio use, modern alternatives like the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x [3] offer superior measured performance with warranty support and parts availability at comparable pricing. The ATH-M20x provides professional monitoring capabilities with verified frequency response measurements and established reliability. Vintage audio enthusiasts may appreciate the HP-50's historical significance within Onkyo's early product lineup, but objective performance considerations strongly favor contemporary alternatives with credible third-party measurements and manufacturer support.
