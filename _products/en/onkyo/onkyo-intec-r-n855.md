## Overview

The Onkyo Intec R-N855 is a network-capable stereo receiver from the company's INTEC series. It features 70W×2 (4Ω) output power and incorporates an AK4490 DAC supporting 768kHz/32bit processing and DSD 11.2MHz playback capabilities. The unit provides diverse network functions including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Chromecast built-in, and AirPlay support. It also includes built-in FM/DAB+ tuners, offering comprehensive coverage from traditional audio sources to streaming services. As a product that packs multiple functions into a compact chassis, it represents the company's approach to the network audio market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The measured performance is at a good level. The THD of 0.08% falls short of the transparent level (0.01% or below) but remains below the problematic level (0.1% or above), representing a reasonable value. The SNR of 106dB clears the transparent level (105dB or above), indicating that background noise is sufficiently suppressed. The frequency response of 5Hz-60kHz (+1dB/-3dB) demonstrates extension beyond the audible range, and the AK4490 DAC's 768kHz/32bit processing capability represents modern standards. Including DSD 11.2MHz support, the digital signal processing performance constitutes specifications that provide scientifically meaningful improvements. However, detailed measurement data for crosstalk and dynamic range are not publicly available, making confirmation of complete transparent level achievement difficult. Due to the lack of actual measurement data, the evaluation is conservative.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The AK4490 DAC represents a reasonable choice as a high-performance chip of its era, demonstrating technical advancement through 768kHz/32bit processing and DSD support. The integration of network functions is relatively well-designed, with technically appropriate implementation of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and various streaming protocols. The VLSC (Vector Linear Shaping Circuitry) technology for signal processing can be evaluated as a unique approach. However, the amplifier section design and power supply specifications remain within industry average standards, with no revolutionary technical breakthroughs evident. Overall, while the product possesses solid technical levels, its technical advantages sufficient to lead the industry are limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Against the current used market price of 498 USD, the comparable product with equivalent or superior measured performance is the Marantz Model 40n (approximately 3,750 USD). The Model 40n has superior measured performance with THD 0.02% and SNR 113dB compared to the R-N855's 0.08% and 106dB, and also features built-in HEOS, Wi-Fi, and network streaming functions. Among current products with equivalent or superior measured performance, the R-N855 represents the most affordable option, earning the maximum cost-performance rating of 1.0. For users prioritizing measured performance, no alternative products exist that achieve THD 0.08% and SNR 106dB at this price point, demonstrating excellent price-to-performance ratio.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Onkyo has a history of financial difficulties and is currently operated under the Premium Audio Company, but the long-term support system is stable. While the product itself is expected to meet certain quality standards as a product from a veteran Japanese audio manufacturer, careful consideration is needed regarding the continuity of after-sales service and firmware updates. The warranty period is standard at one year, but repair services are available. Additionally, this product has already been discontinued, making new unit acquisition difficult, which serves as a negative factor in reliability evaluation. An assessment at industry average level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design approach based on measurable performance indicators is rational. The pursuit of objective performance improvements in THD, SNR, and other metrics, and the adoption of the high-quality AK4490 DAC chip to achieve transparent sound reproduction, are scientifically valid approaches. The integration of network functions, which reduces the need to separately purchase traditional CD players or network players, achieving system simplification and cost reduction, represents a rational design philosophy. The focus on improving measurable technical specifications like DSD support, rather than subjective "sound quality" claims, and the approach to differentiation through objective performance indicators is commendable. However, with higher-performance, lower-cost competing products already existing, the limited differentiation factors represent room for improvement.

## Advice

The R-N855 can be evaluated as a technically excellent product with superior cost-performance. The current used market price of 498 USD represents very attractive pricing compared to current products with equivalent or superior measured performance. No alternative products exist that achieve the measured performance of THD 0.08% and SNR 106dB at this price point, making it a strong option for users prioritizing measured performance. However, the discontinued status and potential support system concerns should be considered. For those considering new purchases, if you prioritize measured performance over price ratio while understanding after-sales service limitations, this product can be recommended. For those prioritizing long-term support, selecting products from current manufacturers is also worth considering.
