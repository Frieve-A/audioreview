## Overview

Marshall Major V is an on-ear Bluetooth headphone released in April 2024. It pairs the brand’s retro styling with practical touches: Bluetooth 5.3 with LC3 (LE Audio–ready), multipoint, wired listening via 3.5 mm, wireless charging, and a headline 100+ hour playtime (third-party battery test ~92 h 52 m). Drivers are 40 mm, nominal 32 Ω, 106 dB/mW. There is no active noise cancelling (ANC). [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Transparent reproduction hinges on frequency response and effective noise control. Third-party testing reports a treble-heavy stock tuning that benefits from app EQ, and passive isolation is limited by the on-ear design; ANC is not provided. While basic electrical specs (32 Ω, 106 dB/mW) are adequate and battery life is excellent, the out-of-box tonal balance and lack of ANC reduce fidelity at the eardrum in typical use. Comprehensive public FR/THD datasets were not found; therefore, starting from a neutral 0.5 baseline and adjusting based on available evidence, we set 0.3. [2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Major V implements current mainstream tech: Bluetooth 5.3 with LC3 (LE Audio–ready), multipoint, app EQ, and rare-for-class wireless charging. Battery management is strong (measured ~92 h 52 m). Marshall also adds a repair program with replaceable batteries. These are thoughtful but incremental advances; driver and codec choices remain conventional. [1][2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Current price is 149 USD. The **cheapest equivalent-or-better** option we identified is **JBL Live 670NC** at **99.95 USD**, which is also on-ear and adds ANC (objectively better isolation) while offering long battery life (tested up to ~88 h). **CP calculation:** 99.95 USD ÷ 149 USD = **0.67** → rounded to **0.7**. Selection rationale: on-ear form, wireless + wired, app EQ, and ANC with measured long endurance; ANC addresses isolation where Major V has none. [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Standard one-year warranty and established retail/service presence. Inclusion in Marshall’s repair program with replaceable batteries is a positive for longevity. No widespread reliability issues are reported in early coverage. Overall, average for the category. [2][6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Prioritizing aesthetic identity and extreme battery life while shipping a treble-heavy stock tuning and omitting ANC in 2024–2025 is not a rational path toward transparent, real-world fidelity. The design choices favor styling and endurance over measured acoustic outcomes at the ear. [2]

## Advice

Choose Major V if you value retro styling, very long battery life, wireless charging convenience, and simple controls, and you’re willing to use EQ. If you need isolation for commuting or flights, an on-ear with ANC such as JBL Live 670NC is more practical and cheaper. Budget-first buyers who don’t need ANC can also consider Sony WH-CH520 for long battery life and app EQ at a much lower price, noting its on-ear passive isolation limits. [2][4][7]
