## Overview

The Superlux HD681F are semi-open, circumaural studio headphones with 50 mm neodymium drivers and a “front row” tuning aimed at flat, vocal-forward reproduction within the HD681 family [1]. Official specs list 32 Ω impedance, 98 dB SPL (1 mW) sensitivity, and a 10–30,000 Hz frequency range; a 2.5 m single-sided cable and 3.5→6.3 mm adapter are included [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, model-specific measurements for **HD681F** remain limited. Per manufacturer specs: 32 Ω, 98 dB SPL (1 mW), max input 300 mW, and 10–30 kHz bandwidth [1][2]. Within the HD681 family, third-party data on the **HD681 (non-F)** shows good mid-range target compliance (RMS deviation ≈ 1.01 dB), fair treble compliance, and weighted harmonic distortion ≈ 0.145 % @ 90 dB and 0.313 % @ 100 dB—below problematic thresholds for headphones [3]. Because these data are not for the F variant, we provisionally center the score at 0.5 and will adjust when HD681F-specific FR/THD measurements (±dB curves, test conditions) are published.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design uses well-established elements: 50 mm dynamic drivers with neodymium magnets, self-adjusting headband, and a simple semi-open venting scheme [1][2]. No proprietary transducer tech, materials, or novel acoustical architecture is claimed; execution is competent but conventional.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Current market price: 28 USD** (Thomann US) [2]. We surveyed cheaper or similarly priced semi-open “monitoring” models:

- **Superlux HD681 (non-F)** at **24.30 USD**: similar form factor but measured tuning is brighter (mid-treble emphasis) rather than flat/vocal-forward; not judged equivalent for “flat” monitoring intent [2][3].  
- **Samson SR850** commonly **≈ 33 USD** in 2025 (Amazon price history) with bright treble per independent measurements [4][6].

Given the lack of a **cheaper** product with **equivalent-or-better** user-visible functions **and** measured/claimed flatness, we set **CP = 1.0** and explicitly note no cheaper equivalent identified at review time. If a cheaper equal-or-better option appears, CP will be revised accordingly.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Build is lightweight plastic with leatherette pads; long-term durability is modest but typical for the price bracket [2][3]. Family-level measurements (HD681 non-F) indicate sample variance—e.g., sub-bass ±5 dB and larger variance >10 kHz across units—which cautions expectations; HD681F variance isn’t separately documented [5]. Warranty terms depend on the retailer; for example, Thomann lists a 30-day return and 3-year retailer warranty program [7]. Overall support outlook is average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Targeting a neutral/“front row” response at a very low price is a rational, measurement-oriented goal for vocal-centric monitoring [1]. The feature set avoids costly, non-audible “audio-myth” embellishments and focuses on fundamentals (fit, simple semi-open acoustics). Absent HD681F-specific third-party data, we withhold a higher score.

## Advice

The HD681F is a strong entry point for budget monitoring where **vocal clarity** and broadly **flat** balance are desired—tracking, editing, and mix checks in quiet rooms. Expect limited isolation and some sound leakage due to the semi-open design [2][3]. If you need more bass presence or a different balance, consider equalization; if you need isolation, choose a closed-back alternative. Purchase from retailers with clear returns to mitigate potential unit-to-unit variance [5][7].
