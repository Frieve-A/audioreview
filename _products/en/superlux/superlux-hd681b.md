## Overview

The Superlux HD681B is the bass-emphasized variant in the HD681 series, using 50 mm dynamic drivers in a semi-open enclosure. It is identifiable by dark-grey accents and targets users who prefer extra low-frequency impact for rock and gaming. Official specifications for the HD681 family and major retailers list **32 Ω impedance**, **98 dB sensitivity**, and a **fixed single-sided 2.5 m cable** (not detachable) [2][3]. Within the series, the “B” tuning increases bass relative to the base HD681/“F” variant positioning [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Variant-specific laboratory data for **HD681B** remain limited as of the review date. We therefore apply a conservative **0.5** and supplement with series measurements (HD681) where appropriate. Reliable third-party measurements on the standard **HD681** show: bass raised by about **+5 dB** with excellent extension, response **within ~±3 dB from 100 Hz to 2.5 kHz**, and treble peaks **~+10 dB above 6 kHz** that are audibly sharp [1]. Distortion on HD681 at **90 dB SPL** reaches **≈3.5 % (3rd)** around **40 Hz**, but falls **<0.1 % above ~120 Hz** [1]. Given the B-variant’s bass emphasis per manufacturer literature [2], neutrality for reference monitoring is limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Conventional 50 mm dynamic drivers in a semi-open shell with a self-adjusting headband represent an established design. No special transducer topology, materials, or novel acoustic modules are claimed in official materials. The **fixed** single-sided cable [3] is functional but not advanced. Overall, implementation is competent yet non-innovative.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Review-target price: 22 USD** (representative U.S. street price). We searched for the *cheapest equivalent-or-better* alternative. The closest proven comparator is the **Superlux HD681** (same semi-open design and user-facing functions; independent measurements available) [1][4]. In the U.S. market on the review week, HD681 lists at **24.30 USD**, while **HD681B** is **21.50 USD** [3][4]. As no cheaper product with equal-or-better functions *and* measured performance was found, **CP is 1.0**.

> Equivalence note: Semi-open over-ear, 50 mm dynamic drivers, comparable series performance; third-party measurements exist for HD681 establishing baseline FR/THD behavior [1], while the B-tuning mainly increases bass [2].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Warranty and parts support are retailer-standard. The **fixed cable** (non-replaceable) [3] can limit lifespan versus detachable-cable designs. Build is typical for the price; longevity varies by handling.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing stronger bass within a semi-open presentation is a coherent trade-off for entertainment or casual monitoring. However, treble peaks reported in series measurements [1] and bass boost reduce accuracy for strict reference work.

## Advice

If you want affordable semi-open headphones with extra bass for rock or gaming, HD681B is sensible. For more neutral monitoring in the same family, consider the standard **HD681** (documented measurements) or the **HD681F/EVO** tunings; for isolation-critical tracking, use a closed-back model. Ensure a returnable retailer in case fit or unit variance does not meet your needs.
