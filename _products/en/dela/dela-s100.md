summary: "DELA’s current S100/2 ‘audiophile’ network switch adds SFP slots, a 1.5MB buffer and a beefed-up PSU/chassis, but credible tests still show no audible or measurable advantage over standard gigabit switches while costing orders of magnitude more."

## Overview

The latest shipping version of this product is the **S100/2**. It uses two 100 Mb RJ45 ports “for best audio quality,” six 1 Gb RJ45 ports for high-traffic devices, **two SFP** cages for optical links, and a **1.5 MB buffer**. The design emphasizes a revised power board with a bank of “audio-grade capacitors” and a rigid steel chassis. These are marketed as creating an “ideal low-noise environment” for networked audio. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Independent measurements on “audiophile” Ethernet switches (e.g., UpTone EtherREGEN; Silent Angel Bonn N8) consistently show **no improvement** in DAC output or audible results versus ordinary IT switches under controlled testing. Claims of better sound from lower “network noise” have not translated into measurable, listener-relevant changes at the analog output. Bit-perfect TCP/IP delivery remains unaffected by the switch so long as packets are delivered correctly. [2][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

From an IT hardware perspective, S100/2 is competently built: mixed-speed RJ45 ports, **dual SFP** for optical links, **fanless** operation, larger buffer and reinforced chassis/power implementation. These are conventional networking technologies applied with audio-focused marketing; there’s no new data-transport mechanism beyond standard Ethernet. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

U.S. market price used for calculation: **3,395 USD**. [4]

We selected two **equal-or-better** comparators from the user standpoint:

- **NETGEAR GS308** (8× gigabit RJ45, fanless). Current market price **19.99 USD** → 19.99 USD ÷ 3,395 USD = **0.00589**. [5]  
- **MikroTik CSS610-8G-2S+IN** (8× gigabit RJ45 **plus 2× SFP+**, fanless). **MSRP 119 USD** → 119 USD ÷ 3,395 USD = **0.03505**. [6]

Both deliver equal-or-better user-visible functionality for networked audio (all-gigabit ports; optical available on the MikroTik) with no worse measured outcomes in audio. Using the policy’s simple average for borderline cases (SFP equivalence), **(0.00589 + 0.03505) / 2 = 0.02047**, which rounds to **0.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The S100/2 is **fanless** with an external PSU and a rigid metal chassis—choices that typically favor longevity and easy replacement of the power brick. The brand provides dealer-based sales/support and publishes manuals and specs on its official site. Nothing here suggests unusual reliability risks, but nothing exceeds standard IT-switch expectations either. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Positioning power-supply tweaks and mechanical damping as conferring audible improvements to **packet-based Ethernet audio** is not supported by controlled measurements. Absent demonstrated changes at the DAC output, the concept remains **irrational** from an engineering standpoint. [2][3]

## Advice

If you need an 8-port switch for audio, buy a standard gigabit model (e.g., GS308) and spend the savings on upgrades with proven returns (room treatment, speakers, or a DAC with verified performance). If you require optical isolation, a low-cost IT switch **with SFP** (e.g., CSS610-8G-2S+IN) plus fiber modules accomplishes that without the audiophile markup. [5][6]
