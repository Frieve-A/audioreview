## Overview

The Universal Audio UA BOCK 187 is a large-diaphragm cardioid FET studio condenser microphone designed by David Bock and manufactured at Universal Audio's Custom Shop. Priced at 1549 USD, this microphone represents Universal Audio's premium approach to recreating vintage microphone characteristics through handcrafted construction and minimalist Class A FET circuitry. The microphone features a K67-type capsule, large Cinemag output transformer, and includes practical features such as a 10dB pad, "Fat" mode low-frequency boost, and high-pass filter. However, the manufacturer explicitly states that their microphones "should be judged by ear, rather than by eye," refusing to publish detailed frequency response plots or comprehensive measurement data, which limits objective evaluation of performance claims.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The UA BOCK 187 demonstrates adequate but not exceptional measured performance based on available specifications. Frequency response is specified as 20Hz-16kHz (±2dB), which limits upper range compared to the full audible spectrum and places it between problematic and transparent levels according to microphone evaluation criteria. Maximum SPL capability of 125dB for 1% THD exceeds the problematic level of 120dB but falls significantly below the excellent level of 140dB. Self-noise measured at 12dB-A by third-party calculation (Sound on Sound) sits above the transparent level of 10dB but well below the problematic level of 20dB-A [1]. The manufacturer's philosophy of avoiding detailed measurement disclosure limits comprehensive performance evaluation. Conservative adjustment applied due to lack of third-party measurements and limited published technical data, resulting in a score positioned between problematic and transparent performance levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The UA BOCK 187 demonstrates solid engineering expertise through David Bock's proprietary microphone design approach and Universal Audio's implementation. The microphone incorporates established Class A FET circuitry with a large Cinemag output transformer for enhanced low-frequency performance, representing appropriate contemporary technology for studio condenser microphones. The handcrafted construction at Universal Audio's Custom Shop reflects high accumulation of microphone manufacturing know-how, while the K67-type capsule technology represents proven industry standards. The design benefits from David Bock's extensive experience in vintage microphone recreation, providing technical differentiation based on specialized expertise. However, the technology primarily builds upon established U87 design principles and is limited to analog/mechanical approaches, focusing on traditional methods rather than modern digital integration or advanced measurement-based optimization.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Cost-performance evaluation reveals significant pricing premium without corresponding measured performance advantages. Market research identified multiple equivalent-or-better large-diaphragm condenser microphones with superior specifications. The Rode NT1 5th Generation, priced at 249 USD, provides cardioid large-diaphragm condenser functionality with demonstrably superior measured performance: wider frequency response (20Hz-20kHz vs 20Hz-16kHz), higher maximum SPL (142dB vs 125dB), and significantly better self-noise (4dB-A vs 12dB-A) [2]. Additional alternatives including Audio Technica AT4040 and Aston Spirit offer similar or better performance at substantially lower prices. CP = 249 USD ÷ 1549 USD = 0.2. The UA BOCK 187 costs over six times more than equivalent-or-better alternatives with superior measured performance, resulting in poor cost-performance ratio.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The UA BOCK 187 benefits from robust construction design and established support infrastructure. The simple FET circuit structure with few moving parts provides inherently reliable design resistant to degradation and failure. Universal Audio provides standard 2-year warranty coverage with original invoice requirement, representing average industry warranty period. Support infrastructure includes Universal Audio's technical support team handling service inquiries, established RMA process for factory service, and authorized David Bock service centers for non-warranty repairs. Handmade construction at Universal Audio's Custom Shop emphasizes quality control focus, while the minimalist circuit design reduces potential failure points. Manufacturing approach prioritizes individual attention and component selection, contributing to overall build quality expectations. Repair processes offer both replacement with new components and reconditioning services, providing comprehensive post-purchase support options.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates significant conflicts with scientifically rational audio equipment development principles. Universal Audio explicitly rejects measurement-based evaluation, stating microphones "should be judged by ear, rather than by eye," which contradicts scientific approaches to audio quality assessment. The manufacturer refuses to publish frequency response plots or polar pattern graphs, limiting objective performance verification. Design emphasis on "sonic target rather than price point" prioritizes subjective evaluation over scientifically verifiable improvements. The handcrafted approach with "unique, high-end components" lacks demonstrated measurement advantages over significantly cheaper alternatives with superior specifications. Premium pricing strategy shows no justification through measurable performance improvements, with the majority of costs appearing unrelated to functional or measurement performance enhancement. The philosophy emphasizes traditional craftsmanship and vintage recreation over innovation toward transparent measurement levels, representing conservative approach that conflicts with rational advancement in microphone technology.

## Advice

For users seeking professional large-diaphragm condenser microphones, consider whether the UA BOCK 187's premium pricing aligns with your specific requirements. If objective measurement performance and cost-effectiveness are priorities, alternatives such as the Rode NT1 5th Generation offer superior specifications at significantly lower cost. The UA BOCK 187 may appeal to users who specifically value David Bock's design philosophy and handcrafted construction approach, understanding that this premium does not translate to measurable performance advantages. Studio professionals requiring maximum SPL capability above 140dB or lowest possible self-noise should evaluate alternatives with superior published specifications. For budget-conscious applications where transparent audio reproduction is the primary goal, numerous alternatives provide equivalent or better measured performance at substantially lower cost. Purchase decisions should prioritize functional requirements and measured performance over brand heritage or subjective marketing claims.
