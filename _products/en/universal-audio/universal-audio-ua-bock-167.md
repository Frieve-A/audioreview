## Overview

The Universal Audio UA Bock 167 is a large-diaphragm tube condenser microphone handmade at UA's Custom Shop in Santa Cruz, California. Designed as an evolution of the classic Neumann U67, it features continuously variable polar patterns (omnidirectional, cardioid, figure-8), NOS EF732 tube, dual-symmetrical K67 capsule, and Lundahl transformer [1]. The microphone includes switchable features such as a "Fat" mode for low-end boost, -10dB pad, and high-frequency contour options. Priced at 3,749 USD, it represents UA's premium approach to microphone design, emphasizing subjective evaluation over measured performance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Multiple specifications fall at or below problematic levels according to measurement criteria for professional microphones. Maximum SPL of 118dB (1% THD) falls below the 120dB problematic threshold [2], while self-noise at 19dB approaches the 20dB problematic level. Frequency response of 10Hz-18kHz lacks the standard 20kHz upper extension. No third-party measurement data is available for verification, as Universal Audio explicitly refuses to publish measurement data, stating that "microphones should be judged by ear rather than by measurements" [3]. The combination of below-standard specifications and absence of independent verification places performance at the problematic level borderline.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The UA Bock 167 demonstrates moderate technology level through in-house Custom Shop design and established audio engineering expertise. The handmade construction and proprietary capsule/transformer combination represent significant technical know-how that would take competitors years to replicate. However, the reliance on NOS EF732 tube technology represents mature, decades-old approaches rather than cutting-edge innovation. The analog-only design lacks modern digital integration, DSP capabilities, or advanced functional features found in contemporary professional microphones. While the craftsmanship and engineering heritage provide technical merit, the conservative technology approach limits advancement potential.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Cost-performance analysis reveals dramatic overpricing relative to alternatives with superior measured performance. The RØDE NT2-A provides equivalent multi-pattern functionality and significantly superior specifications at 419 USD. Equipped with switchable polar patterns (omni, cardioid, figure-8), pad options (0/-5/-10dB), and high-pass filtering, the NT2-A delivers 7dB self-noise versus 19dB, 147dB maximum SPL versus 118dB, and 20Hz-20kHz frequency response versus 10Hz-18kHz [4]. CP = 419 USD ÷ 3,749 USD = 0.1. The calculation demonstrates that equivalent-or-better functionality and performance can be obtained for approximately one-ninth the price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Universal Audio provides global manufacturer support through established dealer networks and direct customer service channels. The RMA process requires registration and proof of purchase, with UA covering return shipping for valid warranty claims [5]. However, tube circuitry introduces inherent complexity and potential reliability concerns compared to solid-state designs. The handmade construction may offer durability benefits but also presents serviceability challenges due to specialized components like NOS tubes. UA's established track record in professional audio provides confidence in long-term support, though the premium positioning may result in higher service costs.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Universal Audio's design philosophy explicitly rejects measurement-based evaluation, with the company refusing to publish frequency response plots or polar pattern graphs for the Bock microphones, "staying true to David Bock's philosophy that microphones should be judged by ear rather than by measurements" [3]. This anti-scientific approach contradicts rational product development focused on measurable improvements. The investment in vintage tube technology and handmade construction adds significant cost without corresponding improvements in measured performance. The design philosophy prioritizes nostalgia and subjective preferences over objective advancement, resulting in products that fail to justify their premium pricing through measurable benefits.

## Advice

The UA Bock 167 cannot be recommended based on objective performance criteria. Potential purchasers seeking professional microphone capabilities should consider the RØDE NT2-A, which provides superior measured performance across all key specifications at dramatically lower cost. The NT2-A's 7dB self-noise, 147dB maximum SPL, and full 20Hz-20kHz frequency response significantly exceed the UA Bock 167's capabilities while offering equivalent multi-pattern functionality for approximately one-ninth the price. For users requiring tube coloration effects, consider modern microphones with digital modeling capabilities that provide greater flexibility and consistency. The UA Bock 167 serves primarily as a luxury item for those prioritizing brand heritage over performance, but objective analysis reveals no technical justification for its premium pricing.
