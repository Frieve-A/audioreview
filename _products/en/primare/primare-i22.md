## Overview
Primare’s I22 is an 80W×2 UFPD Class-D integrated amplifier introduced with the 20/30 Series refresh (sold around 2011) and expandable with an optional DAC board adding Toslink/coax/USB-B inputs[1][2]. It provides four analog inputs plus pre/record outputs and is now listed as a past product (discontinued)[1][3]. MSRP at the time was 1,799 USD[7].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs: 10Hz–20kHz (-0.5dB) frequency response, THD <0.05% (20Hz–20kHz, 10W/8Ω), S/N -95 dBV, and 80W×2 into 8Ω[1]. These are adequate but fall short of today’s state-of-the-art transparent figures, especially in THD and S/N. No comprehensive third-party measurements of I22 itself were found; score is provisional based on official data[1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

UFPD aimed to maintain constant loop gain across the audible band and reduce load dependency—a distinctive implementation for its time[1][2]. Given current Class-D advances and widely available high-performance modules, the relative edge has narrowed; we credit originality but temper for age.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Comparator (equal-or-better)**  
Combine **Fosi Audio V3** power amp with **Schiit SYS** passive preamp to match integrated functionality (source switching + volume). V3 shows low distortion and solid SNR in independent measurements[6], meeting or exceeding I22’s published THD/SN, while the pair covers equivalent user-facing functions[4][5][6].

**Prices (current representative)**  
V3: 89 USD (official)[5]; SYS: 49 USD (official)[4]; total **138 USD**.  
I22 denominator price: **1,799 USD** (MSRP)[7].

**Computation (required display)**  
**138 USD ÷ 1,799 USD = 0.0767** → rounded to one decimal place **0.1**.  
Conclusion: modern equal-or-better amplification can be obtained at under one-tenth the I22’s price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a simple analog integrated, I22 has few inherent wear items. It is, however, a legacy model with no new-unit availability[3]. Primare’s general warranty policy is two years (territory conditions apply), which is industry average[4]. No credible widespread defect data was found; score remains average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The engineering goal—low distortion and stable performance via UFPD—is scientifically grounded, and the feature set is purposefully minimal[1]. Yet considering present-day options delivering superior measured transparency at much lower prices, the design no longer represents a cost-effective route to transparent amplification.

## Advice
Keep an existing I22 if it’s functioning well; it remains a competent, quiet integrated with adequate power. For new purchases, prioritize **modern measured performers**—either an affordable Class-D power amp plus a simple pre (as above) or an integrated with documented low THD+N and high SNR. The I22’s 0.3W standby is operationally nice, but performance-per-dollar favors current alternatives[1][4][5][6].
