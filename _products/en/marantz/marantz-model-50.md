## Overview

The Marantz Model 50 is a 70W+70W integrated amplifier released by the company in 2023. Its most defining feature is the complete elimination of digital inputs, focusing exclusively on analog circuitry. This design clearly targets users who seek to maximize the playback quality of analog sources like turntables and CD players. It incorporates Marantz's traditional technologies, including HDAM modules and a current-feedback power amplifier, featuring five analog line inputs and an MM-compatible phono input. It is priced at approximately 197,505 JPY in the Japanese market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The measured performance is generally good, achieving a level that ensures audible transparency on many metrics. According to SoundStage measurements, its frequency response is nearly flat from 20Hz-20kHz, and both total harmonic distortion (THD) and intermodulation distortion (IMD) are kept at low levels. However, this level of performance is no longer exceptional. For instance, modern low-cost Class D amplifiers like the Topping PA5 II exhibit partially superior measurement results, such as a THD+N of 0.0004% and an SNR of 124dB, which surpass this unit in some aspects. The Model 50 is a competent analog amplifier, but it does not represent today's state-of-the-art performance, and its scientific advantage is limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Marantz's proprietary HDAM modules and traditional Class A/B analog circuitry are well-established, solid technologies. However, from a technological advancement perspective, they remain at the industry average. In an era where modern high-performance Class D amplifiers achieve both superior efficiency and measurement performance, it is difficult to find a technical advantage in adhering to the traditional Class A/B method. While the "pure analog" design requires careful implementation for aspects like noise control, it does not result in performance that surpasses modern technology, making its technology level conservative.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

There are serious cost-performance issues. For example, the YAMAHA A-S301 (34,020 JPY) offers comparable analog functionality plus digital inputs for about 1/6th the price. Furthermore, there are Class D amplifiers like the Topping PA5 II (approx. 34,000 JPY) that are even cheaper and provide superior measured performance. Calculation: 34,020 JPY รท 197,505 JPY = 0.172, which rounds to 0.2. Users can obtain a more powerful and versatile product for a fraction of the cost. Beyond brand value and design, there are no performance-based factors to justify this price gap.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Marantz maintains an established warranty and support system as a long-standing audio manufacturer. The Model 50 comes with a 5-year parts and labor warranty upon owner registration, which exceeds industry standards. The company's products generally have low failure rates with a well-established repair system. The pure analog design, requiring no firmware updates, eliminates software-related issues and ensures long-term stable operation. After-sales service is at an industry-leading level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design philosophy of sticking to "pure analog" may align with the principles of certain audiophiles. However, the reality is that this commitment does not necessarily lead to the best possible performance. Since cheaper, modern Class D amplifiers achieve equivalent or superior measured performance, the rationale behind the claim "pure analog equals high fidelity" is weakened. The exclusion of digital inputs severely compromises convenience, making a separate DAC essential for most users. This results in a more expensive and complex system with lost versatility. Its design philosophy is hard to call rational in today's audio market.

## Advice

Before considering the purchase of a Model 50, I highly recommend acknowledging the existence of modern, low-cost, high-performance Class D amplifiers. Products like the Topping PA5 II or the Fosi Audio V3 offer measured performance that is comparable to, or in some aspects exceeds, the Model 50, all for around 30,000-40,000 JPY. Combining one of these amplifiers with a separate DAC will still result in a total cost far below that of the Model 50, while providing greater flexibility. Unless you place a very high value on the Marantz design and brand name, a more rational decision based on performance and cost would strongly point towards other alternatives.
