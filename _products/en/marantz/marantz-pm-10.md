## Overview

The Marantz PM-10 is a reference-grade integrated amplifier released in 2016 at 8,000 USD. This is a landmark product marking Marantz's first serious adoption of Class D technology, featuring a dual-mono design with 200W (8Ω)/400W (4Ω) output. It incorporates a proprietary Class D amplifier section called "Analog Switched Mode Design," combined with fully balanced circuitry and custom HDAM modules. The product has since been discontinued and replaced by the successor MODEL 10 (15,000 USD).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The PM-10's measurement performance meets transparent-level standards. THD+N measures 0.005%, significantly clearing the transparent-level threshold (0.01% or below), while the S/N ratio achieves 111dB (high-level input), exceeding the 105dB threshold. The frequency response covers 5Hz-50kHz, well beyond the audible range, and shows a high damping factor of 500. These specifications are sufficient to achieve transparent acoustic reproduction for human hearing. Third-party measurement data (such as HiFi News reviews and Audio Science Review related measurements) confirm low THD and high output, supporting the evaluation. However, limited availability of detailed third-party measurement data restricts the evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The PM-10 represented an ambitious technological challenge for Marantz. The fully balanced dual-mono design with bridge output configuration and the adoption of Class D technology, departing from traditional analog approaches, was progressive for 2016. The configuration with independent linear power supplies for the preamp section and switching power supplies for each of the two bridge mono power amplifiers is rational. However, from 2025's technological standards, it shows limited technical superiority compared to more advanced Purifi or Hypex-based designs that specialized Class D manufacturers had already achieved.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The PM-10's cost-performance is extremely poor. Competing products with equivalent or superior measurement performance, such as Purifi-based integrated amplifiers (NAD C399, etc.), are available for around 2,199 USD. These products achieve equivalent or superior THD performance (0.002% or below), equivalent output (180W/8Ω), and higher S/N ratios. Cost-performance calculation: 2,199 USD ÷ 8,000 USD ≈ 0.27, rounded to 0.3. This means equivalent functionality and performance can be obtained for approximately one-third the price of the PM-10.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Marantz maintains an established warranty and support system as a historic audio equipment manufacturer. The company's reliability is above industry average, and the quality of technical support and after-sales service is good. However, since the PM-10 has been discontinued, there are concerns about future parts supply and continued support. The successor MODEL 10's significant price increase to 15,000 USD indicates changes in Marantz's reference-grade product direction.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The PM-10's design philosophy was rational for its time. Marantz's transition from traditional analog amplifier design to Class D technology was a rational approach aimed at balancing efficiency and sound quality. It actually achieved improved measurement performance, representing a scientifically meaningful direction. However, entering the market at 8,000 USD when specialized Class D manufacturers had already achieved superior technology and pricing for equivalent or better performance showed poor market awareness. Currently, abundant options exist for achieving equivalent functionality and performance at lower cost, diminishing the significance of dedicated audio equipment. From a cross-class perspective, combinations like PC and DAC can provide similar transparency at lower cost, but the convenience of an integrated amplifier limits this.

## Advice

While the PM-10 is an excellent product in terms of measurement performance, we cannot recommend purchasing it. With a current budget of 8,000 USD, choosing the latest Purifi-based Class D integrated amplifiers would achieve equivalent or superior measurement performance at lower cost with newer technology. Used units significantly discounted (around 3,000-4,000 USD) might be worth considering, but even then, current products in the same price range would be more rational choices. Unless you find special value in the Marantz brand's acoustic characteristics or corporate philosophy, we strongly recommend other options if you prioritize objective performance-to-price ratio. For cross-class alternatives, consider budget Class D amps combined with general-purpose devices.
