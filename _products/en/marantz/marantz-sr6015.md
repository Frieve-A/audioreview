## Overview

The Marantz SR6015 is a 9.2-channel AV receiver with 11.2 channel processing capability, rated at 110W per channel (8Ω, 20Hz-20kHz, 0.08% THD) [1][2]. Released around 2020-2021, it supports modern surround sound formats including Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, IMAX Enhanced, and Auro 3D [1][2]. The unit features Audyssey MultEQ XT32 room correction, extensive HDMI connectivity with 8K/60Hz and 4K/120Hz support, and HEOS multi-room streaming capabilities [1][2]. Built around Marantz's proprietary HDAM (Hyper Dynamic Amplifier Module) technology [1][2], the SR6015 aims to deliver the company's signature "musical sound" while providing comprehensive home theater functionality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Measured performance consistently exceeds transparent levels across key indicators. Frequency response of 10 Hz – 100 kHz (+1, –3 dB) significantly exceeds transparent criteria of 20Hz-20kHz ±0.5 dB [1][2]. THD performance is excellent with 0.005% analog and 0.008% digital, both substantially better than the 0.01% transparent threshold [1][2]. S/N ratio reaches 100 dB analog and 102 dB digital, approaching the 105 dB transparent level [1][2]. Dynamic range of 100 dB falls between problematic (90 dB) and transparent (105 dB) levels [1][2]. Conservative evaluation applied as these are manufacturer specifications rather than independent third-party measurements. Power output of 110W per channel with 0.08% THD is adequate for most applications [1][2][3]. Overall performance profile clearly exceeds transparent thresholds in most critical areas.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Demonstrates solid technical implementation with proprietary HDAM circuitry using discrete surface mount components and Current Feedback topology [1][2]. Digital processing utilizes Cirrus Logic CS49844A 4-core DSP combined with Analog Devices ADSP-21487 SHARC DSP, providing appropriate contemporary processing power [1][2]. Discrete high current output devices across all nine channels show commitment to quality amplification [1][2]. Component change from AKM AK4458 to Texas Instruments DAC (likely PCM1502A) in units with serial numbers ending 70001 or higher resulted from industry-wide AKM factory fire affecting multiple manufacturers [4]. While the lack of model number update or clear disclosure was less than ideal, this represents external supply chain disruption rather than internal technology regression [4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Equipped with 11.2 channel processing, Dolby Atmos/DTS:X/IMAX Enhanced/Auro 3D support, Audyssey MultEQ XT32 room correction, 7 HDMI inputs with 8K/60Hz and 4K/120Hz support, HEOS multi-room streaming, and voice control capabilities [1][2]. Measured performance includes 110W per channel with excellent THD specifications [1][2]. Product is discontinued with limited new availability, primarily found through remaining dealer inventory at 1,299 USD or secondary markets. Current competitors include the Onkyo TX-RZ50 [5] and Pioneer VSX-LX505 [6], both actively available at 1,399 USD with 120W per channel and 11.2 channel processing. CP = 1.0, but discontinued status with limited warranty coverage reduces practical value.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Marantz provides 3-year warranty coverage for new units with global manufacturer support infrastructure and established brand track record [1][2]. However, documented issues offset these positives. Users report persistent HDMI signal loss problems and HDR compatibility issues, with signal dropouts occurring when source devices change resolution [3]. The undisclosed DAC component change due to AKM factory fire creates additional concerns about long-term consistency and parts availability [4]. While Marantz maintains good customer service infrastructure, these hardware-related issues and supply chain disruptions impact overall reliability evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Demonstrates good technical integration with modern DSP implementation, comprehensive room correction, and HDMI 2.1 support [1][2]. HDAM proprietary technology development shows innovation commitment with measurable advantages in technical specifications [1][2]. However, design philosophy includes subjective "Sound Masters" tuning and "musical sound" marketing claims alongside objective technical achievements [1][2]. Supply chain component changes due to industry-wide disruptions were handled with less transparency than ideal, though this reflects external constraints rather than internal design philosophy regression [4]. While functional integration is appropriate for user purposes, mixture of objective technical innovation with subjective marketing approaches limits rationality assessment.

## Advice

The discontinued SR6015 delivered excellent measured performance and competitive pricing when available. Measured specifications exceed transparent levels in key areas, making it suitable for audiophile-oriented applications. The comprehensive feature set including advanced surround formats, room correction, and modern HDMI connectivity addresses most home theater requirements. However, discontinued status limits availability to remaining dealer inventory or secondary markets with potentially limited warranty coverage. Potential buyers should be aware of documented HDMI compatibility issues, particularly with HDR content and resolution switching. Given limited availability, consider current alternatives like the Onkyo TX-RZ50 or Pioneer VSX-LX505 for new purchases with full warranty support. For users finding remaining new stock, the SR6015 can still provide good value, but test HDMI functionality thoroughly during any return period.
