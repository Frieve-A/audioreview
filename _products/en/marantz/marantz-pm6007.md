## Overview

The Marantz PM6007 is an entry-level integrated amplifier that pairs Marantz’s proprietary HDAM-SA3 discrete analog stages with a built-in 24-bit/192kHz DAC, MM phono input, and A/B speaker switching. Official materials highlight a toroidal power transformer, Schottky barrier diodes, and selectable digital filter modes for the DAC [1][2]. The model has been available since 2020 [3][JA]. Some later production runs have been reported to switch from the AKM AK4490 to an ESS ES9010K2M DAC; this is third-party reporting rather than an official change log [4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent lab measurements for PM6007 units are limited; the following are manufacturer-published specifications. At rated power the PM6007 delivers 45W×2 into 8Ω (60W×2 into 4Ω) with 0.08% THD (20Hz–20kHz), damping factor 100, frequency response 10Hz–70kHz (+0/–1dB), line S/N 102dB and phono (MM) S/N 83dB [1]. These values are competent but fall short of “transparent-level” thresholds (e.g., THD ≤0.01%, line S/N ≥105dB, damping factor ≥100—here just met) used for reference-grade transparency [1][5]. We will incorporate independent test data when available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Key implementation details include current-feedback topology with HDAM-SA3 discrete modules, a fully shielded DAC section with 24-bit/192kHz support, selectable digital filters, a toroidal transformer, and Schottky diodes in the power supply [2]. This represents careful, traditional analog engineering beyond basic op-amp designs, though not a breakthrough relative to contemporary integrated amplifiers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Current market price used for evaluation: **750 USD** for PM6007 (authorized US retailer) [6].  
**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better alternative):** **Yamaha A-S301** integrated amplifier. It provides the same user-facing functions—MM phono input, built-in 24-bit/192kHz DAC (optical/coax), remote, subwoofer output—and comparable or better published metrics (60W×2 into 8Ω @ 0.019% THD, damping factor 210, line S/N 99dB) [7]. Multiple reputable US retailers list new A-S301 units at **349.95 USD** [8][9].

**Calculation:** 349.95 USD ÷ 750 USD = **0.467** → score **0.5** (rounded to one decimal).  
**Why this comparator:** Equal or greater rated power, lower THD, much higher damping factor, and equivalent core features at a substantially lower market price [7][8][9].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Marantz is an established brand with broad US distribution and service. Retailers cite a 3-year warranty term for the PM6007 in the US and standard accessories (remote, etc.) [10]. No systemic reliability issues are evident from official materials and mainstream dealers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The PM6007 pursues incremental fidelity via robust analog stages (discrete HDAM, toroidal PSU, careful shielding). These choices are scientifically reasonable, but they do not translate into objectively class-leading transparency versus cheaper modern rivals with equal functionality. The design is coherent yet not cost-disruptive.

## Advice

Choose the PM6007 if you want an analog-centric integrated with built-in DAC and phono, sub out, A/B speaker switching, and Marantz’s proven hardware recipe in a single box. If maximizing price-to-performance is your priority, the Yamaha A-S301 delivers comparable functionality and at least comparable published performance for roughly half the US street price [7][8][9].
