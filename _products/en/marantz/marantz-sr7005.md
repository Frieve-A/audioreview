## Overview

The Marantz SR7005 is a 7.1-channel AV receiver from the 2010-2011 era that was originally priced at 1600 USD. It features 125 watts per channel amplification with current feedback topology in the preamplifier stage and discrete amplification circuits. The receiver supports comprehensive audio formats including Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, offers 192kHz/24-bit D/A conversion, and includes Audyssey MultEQ XT room correction. With 6 HDMI inputs (1.4a standard) and extensive connectivity options, it represented a solid mid-to-high-end offering during its production period. The unit has been discontinued and is no longer available as a new product.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The SR7005 achieves most performance targets within transparent levels based on manufacturer specifications and available third-party measurements. THD measures 0.08 percent across 20Hz-20kHz frequency range when driving rated power output, well below the 0.1 percent problematic threshold [1]. Rated power output of 125 watts per channel (8 ohms, 2 channels driven) provides substantial amplification capability. Frequency response spans 10Hz-100kHz (+1/-3dB) in Direct Mode, significantly exceeding the audible range requirements [1]. The discrete amplification design with current feedback topology represents solid engineering implementation that typically achieves transparent performance levels in this power class. However, since the evaluation is primarily based on manufacturer specifications, a conservative deduction of 0.1 is applied.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The SR7005 incorporates current feedback topology in the preamplifier stage, representing proprietary Marantz technology distinct from conventional voltage feedback designs. Discrete amplification circuits with modular construction demonstrate significant engineering expertise and technical sophistication for the era. The receiver utilizes Analog Devices SHARC 32-bit digital signal processing for audio decoding and room correction functions. However, from a 2025 evaluation perspective, the technology represents mature implementations that were contemporary in 2010-2011 but are now superseded by more advanced approaches. The combination of analog amplification expertise with appropriate digital processing integration shows solid technical implementation, though without cutting-edge innovation that would be competitive with current technology standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The SR7005's current used market price of approximately 400 USD requires comparison with equivalent-or-better alternatives from the same technological era. The Denon AVR-3311CI from 2010 provides equivalent 125W per channel power output (8 ohms, 20Hz-20kHz) with 7.2 channel processing, HDMI 1.4a connectivity, and comparable room correction capabilities [2]. Comparing the measured performance values indicated in Scientific Validity, the SR7005's THD measures 0.08 percent (at rated output, 20Hz-20kHz) [1], while the AVR-3311CI's THD measures 0.05 percent (at rated output, 20Hz-20kHz) [2], demonstrating equivalent-or-better measured performance. Rated power output is equivalent at 125W per channel (8 ohms, 2 channels driven) for both units. Both receivers feature the same HDMI 1.4a standard, similar networking capabilities, and equivalent audio processing from the 2010-2011 era, making them directly comparable in user-facing functionality. Current used market pricing for the AVR-3311CI ranges from 150-250 USD based on condition and included accessories, making it significantly cheaper than the SR7005. CP = 150 USD ÷ 400 USD = 0.375, rounded to 0.4.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Marantz provides 3-year warranty coverage for AV receivers, exceeding typical industry standards. The discrete amplification design and modular construction suggest inherently robust architecture resistant to component degradation. Global support infrastructure includes authorized service facilities for both in-warranty and out-of-warranty repairs. However, the SR7005 has documented issues with I/O Controller Chip failure on the Main Board, typically caused by static discharge, resulting in video output malfunction. This represents a specific reliability concern that affects long-term dependability. Service manuals remain available through third-party technical resources, supporting continued serviceability despite discontinuation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Marantz's "Because Music Matters" philosophy aims to reproduce music as originally intended, representing a reasonable foundational approach. The implementation demonstrates appropriate adoption of measurement-based technologies including room correction and discrete amplification that provide objectively measurable benefits. Comprehensive functional integration combining amplification, digital processing, room correction, and networking capabilities justifies existence as specialized equipment over general-purpose alternatives. However, marketing emphasis on subjective qualities like "warm, rich sound" and "musicality" alongside technical specifications suggests mixed approach partially relying on non-scientific claims. The current feedback topology represents genuine technical innovation, but overall design philosophy balances scientific rationality with subjective audio beliefs rather than pursuing purely measurement-focused optimization.

## Advice

As a discontinued product, the SR7005 should only be considered from the used market where cost-performance analysis reveals significant pricing disadvantages compared to equivalent era alternatives. Potential purchasers should prioritize units with documented service history and verified functionality, particularly regarding HDMI output operation due to known I/O controller issues. The 3-year original warranty likely no longer applies to used units, making reliable seller selection crucial. Equivalent alternatives like the Denon AVR-3311CI from the same era provide similar functionality at substantially lower used market prices. The SR7005's 400 USD used market pricing represents poor value when comparable receivers can be found for 150-250 USD, making alternative era-equivalent receivers more rational purchasing decisions.
