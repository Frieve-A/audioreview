## Overview

The Marantz MODEL M1 is a 2-channel wireless streaming amplifier released in June 2024. Priced at 154,000 JPY with current availability from 128,700 JPY, it is manufactured at Japan's Shirakawa Audio Works factory with tuning by Marantz sound masters. The product features 100W+100W (8Ω) Class D amplification, 32-bit DAC, HDMI eARC support, and HEOS built-in, all housed in a compact 217mm-width chassis. It won the EISA 2024-2025 Best Compact Streaming Amplifier Award.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Marantz MODEL M1 delivers 100W+100W (8Ω, 0.05% THD) and 125W+125W (4Ω) output performance, showing appropriate measurements for a Class D amplifier. The 32-bit DAC enables high-precision reproduction of digital sources supporting 24bit/192kHz PCM and DSD128. MMDF (Marantz Musical Digital Filtering) provides the company's proprietary acoustic tuning. HDMI eARC also provides Dolby Digital+ processing capability. However, at the 128,700 JPY price point, higher-output and higher-performance competing products exist, and there is no particular superiority in pure measurement performance. Due to compact chassis constraints, absolute performance has limitations compared to large amplifiers. The application of speaker-specific THD evaluation standards (0.1% or below as excellent for speakers) to amplifier evaluation represents inappropriate methodology, as amplifiers should be held to stricter electronic component standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Manufactured at Japan's Shirakawa Audio Works factory under the same quality control as Marantz high-end models. Class D amplifier technology adoption achieves both compactness and efficiency. Comprehensive streaming functionality through HEOS, AirPlay2, Bluetooth, and Spotify Connect support, plus TV audio integration via HDMI eARC support meet modern technical requirements. MMDF technology realizes Marantz's distinctive acoustic characteristics in digital filtering. The technical level of efficiently integrating necessary functions within 217mm width constraints is commendable. However, compared to USD 1,500 class products, technological advancement has limitations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Marantz MODEL M1 current price is 128,700 JPY, which is at an appropriate level compared to competing products in the same price range. The Denon HOME AMP (99,000 JPY) has similar functionality at approximately 29,700 JPY less, giving CP = 99,000 JPY ÷ 128,700 JPY = 0.77 evaluation. The Marantz STEREO 70s (from 88,000 JPY) offers more functionality with 75W output, significantly inferior in pure function-to-price ratio. In pure performance evaluation excluding Japanese premium quality and brand value, clear advantages commensurate with price are limited. Compared to 80,000 JPY class entry models, performance improvements matching the price difference depend mainly on brand quality and chassis refinement, with no dramatic improvement expected in sound quality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Reliability as a Marantz brand is high with quality assurance from Japanese manufacturing. Production at Shirakawa Audio Works factory ensures quality control systems equivalent to high-end models. Appropriate support systems as official domestic products with warranty periods and repair response above industry standards. Class D amplifier adoption results in low heat generation, enabling long-term stable operation. HEOS support enables firmware updates for feature expansion and bug fixes. High reliability is achieved through solid design philosophy despite compact design.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 217mm-width compact chassis design is a rational approach considering modern living environments. HDMI eARC support enables functioning as a TV audio system, achieving integration beyond simple audio amplifiers. HEOS, AirPlay2, Bluetooth, and Spotify Connect support provides comprehensive connectivity for modern streaming environments. Class D technology adoption appropriately balances efficiency and sound quality. Japanese tuning reflects design philosophy inheriting the company's acoustic philosophy. However, at the 130,000 JPY price range, adoption of more advanced digital signal processing and AI optimization technologies could be expected. The lack of transparent measurement data publication limits the ability to verify claimed performance characteristics, representing a significant limitation in design philosophy transparency for products at this price point.

## Advice

The Marantz MODEL M1 is suitable for users seeking compact yet high-quality streaming amplifiers. At 128,700 JPY, there is value in experiencing Japanese manufacturing quality and Marantz brand acoustic characteristics. HDMI eARC support enables use as a TV audio system with high integration in living environments. However, for pure sound quality performance priority, higher-output conventional amplifiers in the same price range are also options. Comparing with the Denon HOME AMP (99,000 JPY), whether the approximately 30,000 JPY price difference provides commensurate value becomes an important judgment factor. For audio-only applications, considering larger, higher-performance integrated amplifiers is also rational. This is the optimal choice when prioritizing compactness, design, and integrated functionality.

## Additional Information

While Class D amplifier adoption achieves high efficiency, acoustic characteristics differ from conventional Class A or AB amplifiers, requiring attention. The 217mm-width compact design also has constraints for driving large speakers or high-volume reproduction. When utilizing HDMI eARC functionality, compatibility confirmation with corresponding TVs is also important.
