## Overview

The Marantz PM8006 is a stereo integrated amplifier rated at 70 W × 2 into 8 Ω and 100 W × 2 into 4 Ω. It belongs to Marantz's 8000 series and employs the company's HDAM-SA3 discrete current-feedback circuits and a toroidal power transformer. Official documentation provides full specifications including THD, S/N, bandwidth, damping factor, and input sensitivities; no credible third-party bench test data was identified at this time [1][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Based on the official manual, PM8006 achieves: THD 0.02% (20 Hz–20 kHz, 8 Ω, both channels) [1]; line-input S/N 106 dB (CD/Tuner/Network/Aux, 2 V in, rated out) and phono MM S/N 87 dB (5 mV in, 1 W out) [1]; output bandwidth 5 Hz–60 kHz at 0.06% [1]; frequency response 5 Hz–100 kHz ±3 dB (CD, 1 W, 8 Ω) [1]; damping factor 100 (8 Ω, 40 Hz–20 kHz) [1]. Several indicators are near or at the “transparent” thresholds (e.g., line S/N ≥105 dB), while THD is between problematic and transparent. With no verified third-party measurements found, a conservative 0.6 is assigned.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The PM8006 uses discrete HDAM-SA3 current-feedback stages and a toroidal transformer. These are solid, well-understood approaches focused on noise, bandwidth, and stability rather than novel architectures. Overall, this reflects competent engineering with incremental benefits over generic op-amp designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator (US): Yamaha A-S801. It offers 100 W/ch (8 Ω), similar THD (0.019%), built-in DAC and digital inputs (equal-or-better functions for typical users) [2]. Official US price observed: 999.95 USD [2]. Using a typical new US street for PM8006 of 1,199 USD (discontinued; priced when last widely available), CP is calculated as: 999.95 ÷ 1,199 = 0.833 → 0.8.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Marantz maintains solid build quality and global service coverage. PM8006’s conventional linear PSU and conservative ratings generally favor longevity. Specific MTBF data is not published.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Focus on measurable parameters (THD, bandwidth, S/N) and proven circuit blocks is rational. No reliance on untestable claims is evident in official materials.

## Advice

PM8006 is a competent integrated amplifier with clear, decent specs and traditional ergonomics. If you need onboard DAC/USB, peers like Yamaha A-S801 provide that at lower or similar total system cost; if you prefer an all-analog path with a good MM phono stage, PM8006 remains attractive.
