## Overview

The Marantz NA-11S1 is a network audio player and DAC from the Reference Series, released in 2013. It boasts excellent measurement performance with 24bit/192kHz PCM and DSD support, a 110dB S/N ratio, and 0.001% THD+N, designed as a high-end unit for its time. It is currently discontinued and trades on the used market for around 767 USD. As a high-end, Japanese-made product manufactured at Marantz's domestic factory, it was a flagship representing the brand's prestige.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement data still reaches transparent levels today. Performance specifications of 0.001% THD+N, a 110dB S/N ratio, and channel separation of over 110dB far exceed human audible thresholds. The frequency response is excellent at 2Hz-50kHz (-3dB) for 192kHz signals and 2Hz-20kHz for 44.1kHz, with Stereophile's measurements confirming a resolution equivalent to 20 bits. When compared against modern measurement standards, all parameters clear the transparency level, providing scientifically valid sound quality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While high-level for 2013 standards, it falls below average by current criteria. The DAC chip and circuit design lack notable proprietary technologies, and network functionality is limited to wired LAN only, with no Wi-Fi capability. Streaming service support is also limited, lacking modern Roon Ready certification or MQA support. Though Marantz's design philosophy is evident, there are no technical breakthroughs or industry-leading innovations. It remains a careful implementation of existing technology, without proprietary advancements that other companies would desire.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Against the used market price of 767 USD, the WiiM Ultra (396 USD) exists with equivalent or superior functionality and measurement performance. The calculation is: 396 USD รท 767 USD = 0.52, which rounds to 0.5. Even more affordable alternatives, such as pairing a PC with a high-performance USB DAC like the Topping E30 II Lite (approximately 100 USD), can achieve superior measurement performance at a fraction of the cost. With overwhelmingly cheaper alternatives available for network playback, DAC functionality, and measurement performance, its cost-performance is poor. The rationale for its existence as a dedicated device has been lost in modern times.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While maintaining a certain level of quality as a Marantz brand product, official support is limited as it was discontinued after its 2013 release. There are concerns about the long-term availability of parts and repair services, increasing the risk in case of failure. Although the build quality was robust for its era, obtaining it on the used market means potential variations between units and the effects of aging. The warranty is limited to short-term coverage from used dealers, making its long-term reliability inferior to new products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the design philosophy was rational for 2013, its irrational aspects are prominent by modern standards. The product category of a dedicated network audio player has itself become replaceable by PC + DAC configurations or a smartphone + external DAC, diminishing its reason for existence. The design lacks modern conveniences like Wi-Fi support and comprehensive streaming service compatibility. While achieving transparent-level measurement performance is commendable, the high-cost approach of a dedicated device lacks rationality today, when equivalent performance can be realized at a vastly lower cost.

## Advice

This product is not recommended for purchase. With a budget of 767 USD, you could acquire a WiiM Ultra (396 USD) and invest the rest in a higher-performance power amplifier or speakers, or build a system with equivalent or superior performance using a PC + high-performance USB DAC configuration. Unless you have a strong attachment to the Marantz brand or are seeking vintage value, there is absolutely no objective advantage in sound quality. This is especially true if you are looking for modern conveniences (Wi-Fi, extensive streaming service support, Roon Ready, etc.). Investing your budget in modern products will provide a far superior musical experience.
