## Overview

The Marantz PM-7000N is a network-enabled integrated amplifier featuring built-in HEOS functionality. As the company's first integrated Hi-Fi amplifier to adopt current feedback circuitry, it delivers 60W×2 (8Ω) output power. It supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and AirPlay 2, with capability for high-resolution audio playback up to DSD 5.6MHz. The unit incorporates proprietary HDAM-SA3 technology with discrete Class A/B circuitry and a shielded toroidal transformer.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance achieves excellent standards. THD of 0.02% approaches the transparent level (0.01% or below), while SNR of 115dB (line input) exceeds the transparent level (105dB or above). Frequency response of 5-100kHz (±3dB) secures sufficient bandwidth, and the damping factor of 100 (8Ω reference) achieves the transparent level (100 or above). Phono input SNR of 87dB is also favorable. These measured values sufficiently contribute to ensuring transparency within the audible range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The HDAM-SA3 module and discrete current feedback circuitry represent the company's technical characteristics, but do not reach industry-leading standards. The AKM4490EQ DAC chip is a standard choice. While network function integration represents a contemporary approach, technical innovation remains limited. Basic design elements such as the shielded toroidal transformer are solid, but no outstanding proprietary technologies are evident.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Against the 682 USD price point, the Yamaha R-N803 (521 USD) offers 145W×2 output, SABRE 9006AS DAC, and equivalent network functionality. Calculation: 521 USD ÷ 682 USD = 0.763. A competitive product with higher output and equivalent DAC is available approximately 24% cheaper, but the price difference is smaller than initially anticipated, placing cost-performance within acceptable range.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Marantz provides appropriate warranty and support systems as an established audio brand. Product failure rates are industry-average, with well-organized repair infrastructure. Firmware updates are supported, and reliability for long-term use meets standard levels. However, industry-leading warranty periods or innovative support services are not provided.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Network function integration represents a rational approach to contemporary music listening environments. The HEOS platform's multi-room functionality, high-resolution audio support, and various streaming service compatibility appropriately respond to digital age requirements. The design philosophy seeking to balance transparent-level measurement performance with convenience is extremely rational. The provision of integrated functions that are difficult to replicate with general-purpose equipment is also commendable.

## Advice

The PM-7000N is a product excelling in measurement performance and functionality. While the competitive Yamaha R-N803 with equivalent functionality and higher output is available approximately 24% cheaper, the price difference remains within acceptable range. For users prioritizing Marantz brand reliability and HEOS ecosystem integration, this represents a suitable choice. While alternatives exist for purely price-focused users, this product is recommended for users seeking both integrated design convenience and measurement performance balance.
