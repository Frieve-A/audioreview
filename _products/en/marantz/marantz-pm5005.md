## Overview

The Marantz PM5005 is a 2014 entry-level integrated amplifier rated at 40 W/8 Ω and 55 W/4 Ω. Original U.S. price was **499 USD**; Japan MSRP was **35,750円** (tax-in)[3][4][11][12]. It employs Marantz HDAM (SA3/SA2) with current-feedback topology and provides six analog inputs including an MM phono stage, tone controls, Source Direct, A/B speaker switching, and a headphone out[1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specs: **THD 0.01%**, **line S/N 103 dB**, **MM S/N 83 dB**, **10 Hz–50 kHz FR**, **DF 100**[1][2]. These meet transparent reproduction targets, albeit **borderline** given the line S/N versus a 105 dB ideal. No comprehensive third-party bench was found; assessment is based on official data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Conventional Class-AB with HDAM (SA3/SA2) and current-feedback. Solid for its class, but not notably innovative today[1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better setup** identified (new, widely available):

- **SMSL AO300** DAC/amp/headamp (remote, tone EQ, multiple digital inputs; 85 W×2/8 Ω, THD+N 0.003%, S/N 107 dB): **289 USD**[6][7]  
- **ART DJPRE II** MM phono preamp (S/N >90 dB): **74.99 USD**[8][9]  
- **4-in/1-out RCA selector (MT-VIKI 431AV)**: **15.00 USD**[10]

Total **378.99 USD**, undercutting the PM5005's **499 USD**, while matching/surpassing required functions and measured performance. AO300 exceeds PM5005 in output and noise/distortion and adds digital conveniences; DJPRE II restores MM phono; the RCA selector approximates the richer analog I/O[6][7][8][10].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Being discontinued, warranty/parts availability are uncertain and service tends to prioritize current models; no robust failure-rate statistics found[2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Measurement-sane with no pseudoscientific claims, but present-day value is limited given modern gear delivering equal-or-better fidelity at lower prices.

## Advice

If you want new gear with equal-or-better fidelity and functions, the **AO300 + DJPRE II (+ simple RCA selector)** bundle offers superior value. If you specifically want a one-box integrated with built-in phono from a current lineup, consider models with published low THD and high S/N—many undercut **499 USD** while adding digital inputs.
