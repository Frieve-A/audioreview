## Overview

The Marantz Model 10 is a reference integrated amplifier using Class D "Eigentakt" technology co-developed with Purifi Audio. It delivers 250W into 8Ω and 500W into 4Ω, marking it as Marantz's most powerful integrated amplifier. Featuring a fully balanced pure analog design without DAC or streaming, the 34kg aluminum chassis includes a dedicated linear power supply for the preamplifier.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Model 10 exhibits outstanding measurement performance. Total harmonic distortion (THD) is 0.05% at rated output and 0.005% at 125W, below the 0.01% transparency level. Signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is 122dB for line inputs, exceeding 105dB transparency, with phono values at 88dB (MM) and 76dB (MC). Frequency response is +0/-0.3dB from 20Hz-20kHz, within ±0.5dB transparency. Damping factor of 500 provides superior speaker control. These metrics affirm high scientific validity for source fidelity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Model 10 reaches industry-leading technical standards. Its custom Purifi Class D module resolves traditional Class D distortion issues. It includes dual-mono fully balanced design, new HDAM and HDAM3 circuits, and a dedicated linear preamplifier power supply. Marantz's Shirakawa-tuned modules and SMPS, based on Purifi, show unique contributions. The 34kg chassis with vibration control enhances the overall technical level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At 15,000 USD, the Model 10 struggles with cost-performance against equivalents. Alternatives include the NAD M33 (6,499 USD, 200W/8Ω, 380W/4Ω, THD <0.003%, S/N >120dB, FR ±0.2dB, DF >800, with DAC/streaming/phono) and Buckeye Purifi stereo amp (1,495 USD, 250W/8Ω, 500W/4Ω, THD <0.0005%, S/N 130dB, FR flat, DF high). Both match or exceed output and measurements while offering similar analog functions, with NAD adding digital versatility. Calculation: (6,499 USD + 1,495 USD)/2 ÷ 15,000 USD ≈ 0.26, rounded to 0.3, indicating overpricing.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a veteran brand under Sound United since the 1950s, Marantz provides standard warranties and global repair networks. The Model 10 sees shortages due to demand, affecting availability. Long-term data is limited as a new product, but Purifi's track record and analog simplicity suggest reliability. A 15,000 USD item expects enhanced support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Model 10 mixes rational elements like Purifi technology and balanced design but falters with its pure analog restriction. Excluding DAC and streaming limits utility in modern setups, where alternatives like smartphone + DAC/amplifier achieve equivalent fidelity cheaper. Digital-integrated options provide superior efficiency and functionality without compromising measurements, rendering the analog-only philosophy less rational.

## Advice

Buyers should evaluate needs and budget rigorously. The Model 10 suits analog purists with exceptional measurements, but alternatives like NAD M33 (6,499 USD) or Buckeye Purifi (1,495 USD) offer comparable output (200-250W/8Ω), measurements, and phono at far lower costs, with added digital features in NAD. The 15,000 USD premium yields limited returns. Most users benefit more from versatile, affordable high-performers.
