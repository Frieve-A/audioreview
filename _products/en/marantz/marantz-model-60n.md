## Overview

The Marantz Model-60n is a 60W×2 channel Class A/B integrated amplifier with integrated network streaming functionality, released in 2024. It features an ESS ES9018K2M DAC chip and Marantz's proprietary HDAM circuit technology, with comprehensive streaming service support through HEOS Built-in. While offering modern connectivity including HDMI ARC, phono input, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi, it maintains Marantz's traditional sound philosophy. With a retail price of approximately 1190 USD, it stands as a notable product in a segment where equivalent competitors are limited.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Measured performance is excellent, with THD achieving 0.0007-0.006% (20Hz-20kHz, 10W/8Ω) and reaching as low as 0.0003% in the digital stage. S/N ratio is 106dB for the digital stage but 95dB for the amplifier stage, with the latter in the intermediate range between problem and transparent levels. Frequency response is flat at ±0.02dB (20Hz-20kHz), extending to -0.4dB/100kHz. While crosstalk and dynamic range figures are not published, the combination of ESS DAC and HDAM circuitry suggests performance approaching transparent levels in most areas. These measured values indicate minimal audio quality degradation in the audible range, demonstrating scientifically reasonable validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ESS ES9018K2M DAC chip has proven performance as a high-quality DAC, and HDAM represents a certain technical value as Marantz's proprietary design. The Class A/B amplification circuit, while conservative, provides stable design that achieves 81W/8Ω and 128W/4Ω output exceeding rated specifications. HEOS Built-in network functionality is also practical. However, these technologies are primarily combinations of existing technologies, with limited revolutionary proprietary innovations. While measured performance is excellent, no technical breakthroughs are evident, and advanced features that significantly exceed industry standards are not recognized. This can be evaluated as a product based on solid combinations of established technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At the current retail price of 1190 USD, no competitors with equivalent functionality and measured performance are available at a lower price. Potential comparisons include the Yamaha R-N600A (approximately 400 USD), which offers 80W output, ESS SABRE ES9010K2M DAC, MusicCast network functionality, and phono input. However, the Yamaha's measured performance is inferior, with higher THD at 0.07%, S/N at 100dB, and less flat frequency response at ±0.5dB, making it not equivalent. Denon PMA-600NE (approximately 400 USD) lacks network functionality, and Cambridge Audio CXA81 MKII (approximately 1200 USD) lacks comprehensive streaming. As no lower-priced product matches both functionality and measured performance, this represents the most cost-effective option.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Marantz holds an established position in the industry as a veteran audio brand with over 70 years of history. Product warranty is provided for periods equivalent to standard consumer electronics, with domestic authorized dealer support systems well-established. However, specific failure rate data and MTBF are not published, and while there are no concerns typical of emerging manufacturers, objective evidence to definitively claim industry-leading levels is limited. Regarding firmware updates, future functionality improvements such as DSD256 support have been announced, suggesting continued support can be expected. Overall, this can be evaluated as reliability and support levels above industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

This represents a rational approach that clearly establishes differentiation factors against smartphone + external DAC configurations by integrating network functionality into traditional dedicated audio equipment. HDMI ARC support simplifies TV connections, adapting to modern usage environments. The design emphasizing near-transparent measured performance achievement is based on scientific evidence, eliminating occult elements. The adoption of Class A/B amplification, while scientifically questionable regarding sound quality advantages over Class D, is a realistic choice considering heat generation and efficiency. The utilization of the HEOS ecosystem to provide multi-room functionality that would be difficult to achieve with general-purpose equipment is also rational.

## Advice

The Model-60n may appear expensive at 1190 USD for a 60W×2 integrated amplifier, but it offers unique value as no competitors provide equivalent network functionality and measured performance. For users who prioritize comprehensive streaming service support and multi-room functionality through HEOS, this becomes a product with few alternatives. However, if network functionality is unnecessary and pure amplifier performance is the sole requirement, lower-priced products like the Denon PMA-600NE may be sufficient. Before purchasing, it's important to specifically consider the value of network functionality and the HEOS ecosystem. For those seeking 80W output like the Cambridge Audio CXA81 MKII, selection should be made after understanding the differences in streaming functionality. Since measured performance is solid, this product can be recommended for users seeking near-transparent sound quality.
