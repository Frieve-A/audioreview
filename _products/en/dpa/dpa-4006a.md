## Overview

The DPA 4006A is an omnidirectional pencil microphone from DPA Microphones, a Danish company with six decades of experience in professional microphone design. This microphone represents DPA's commitment to "precision and perfection" in audio capture, delivering what the company describes as "total transparency" in recording situations. The 4006A features a modular design allowing capsule and amplifier interchangeability, transformerless active drive circuitry, and comes with individual calibration charts. It targets professional recording studios, concert halls, film/TV production, and classical performance applications where accurate omnidirectional pickup and high sound quality are essential.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The DPA 4006A achieves measurements that consistently place it between problematic and transparent performance levels, leaning toward transparent. Frequency response covers 10-20,000 Hz with ±2 dB deviation from 10-20 kHz [1], which is better than the ±3 dB standard but lacks full 20Hz-20kHz coverage. The self-noise level of 15.0 dB(A) [2] sits between the 10 dB-A transparent level and 20 dB-A problematic level. Signal-to-noise ratio of 79 dB(A) [6] falls just below the 80 dB transparent threshold but well above the 60 dB problematic level. Maximum SPL capability of 139-147 dB [2][6] meets or exceeds the 140 dB SPL excellent level. Dynamic range of 124 dB [6] significantly exceeds expectations for professional microphones. Total harmonic distortion remains below 1% up to 139 dB SPL peak [6]. The measurements demonstrate solid professional performance with particularly strong maximum SPL and dynamic range capabilities.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The DPA 4006A represents advanced microphone technology with significant proprietary innovations. DPA's modular capsule and amplifier system allows pattern and body swapping, providing flexibility competitors would want to adopt [1][3]. The company's six decades of microphone development experience has produced proprietary technologies including CORE and CORE+ technologies for improved sound quality [3]. The transformerless active drive circuitry with interchangeable grids for frequency response modification demonstrates sophisticated engineering [2][3]. DPA maintains competitive advantages through precision manufacturing that takes years for competitors to match. The modular architecture, individual calibration charts, and manufacturing precision position this microphone at the forefront of professional microphone technology. The integration of acoustic modifications, pressure equalizers, and interference tube technology showcases advanced technical implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The DPA 4006A is priced at 2,660 USD in the current market. Equipped with omnidirectional pickup pattern, phantom power operation, modular design capabilities, individual calibration charts, and frequency response of 10-20,000 Hz (±2 dB) [1], with self-noise performance (15.0 dB-A) [2], dynamic range (124 dB), and maximum SPL (139-147 dB) specifications for professional applications [6]. Comparison analysis reveals the Neumann KM 183 as an equivalent-or-better omnidirectional condenser microphone with superior self-noise (13 dB-A versus 15.0 dB-A), similar maximum SPL (140 dB), and superior dynamic range (127 dB versus 124 dB) [7]. The Neumann KM 183 provides equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance at 899 USD. CP = 899 USD ÷ 2,660 USD = 0.3

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

DPA provides comprehensive 5-year warranty coverage for the 4000-series pencil microphones, significantly exceeding the typical 2-year industry standard [4]. The warranty covers "mechanical functionality" matching published specifications and defects in "material and workmanship under normal use" [4]. The simple pencil microphone design with few moving parts provides inherent robustness against degradation and failure. DPA maintains a global manufacturer support system with established repair processes, including stereo pair rematching services for matched microphone applications [4]. The company guarantees repair support during the announced warranty period and makes "reasonable efforts" to provide ongoing support even for discontinued products [4]. With six decades of operation and a strong track record in professional applications, DPA demonstrates exceptional reliability and support infrastructure that surpasses industry standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

DPA's design philosophy emphasizes measurement-based development with focus on "precision and perfection" and "pristine sound and technical innovation" [5]. The company demonstrates rational cost allocation toward functional and performance improvements through proprietary technologies like modular design systems and transformerless active drive circuitry [3][5]. DPA's six decades of R&D investment has produced continuous technology advancement including CORE+ technologies and sophisticated modular architecture [3][5]. The technical focus areas include directivity management, vibration reduction, environmental protection, and balanced signal implementation [5]. The company's emphasis on technical precision, measurable performance improvements, and scientific approaches to microphone development aligns with rational audio engineering principles. The modular design allows users to optimize configurations for specific applications while maintaining measurement-driven quality standards, demonstrating innovative approaches that directly contribute to functional capabilities and measured performance.

## Advice

The DPA 4006A is recommended for professional recording applications requiring omnidirectional pickup with transparent sound capture. Its modular design provides valuable flexibility for studios working with multiple microphone configurations. The 5-year warranty and established support infrastructure make it suitable for critical professional environments where reliability is essential. Consider this microphone when maximum SPL capability (139-147 dB) and dynamic range (124 dB) are important for your applications. The individual calibration charts and precision manufacturing justify the professional pricing for users requiring consistent, measurable performance. Alternative consideration should be given to the Neumann KM 183 for superior self-noise performance and dynamic range at significantly lower pricing. The modular capsule system offers long-term value for facilities that may need different pickup patterns in the future.
