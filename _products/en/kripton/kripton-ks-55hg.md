## Overview

The Kripton KS-55HG is an active speaker that supports 96kHz/24bit wireless playback with both LDAC and aptX Adaptive codecs. It features a Tymphany 30mm ring diaphragm tweeter and a 63.5mm woofer, utilizing a 35W×4 full digital amplifier configuration. Touting a frequency response of 70Hz-60kHz and supporting high-resolution playback up to 192kHz/24bit via USB input and DSD128, it is positioned as a high-functioning model in Kripton's KS series.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The claimed frequency response of 70Hz-60kHz is wideband for a compact speaker, but the low-frequency limit of 70Hz is a physical constraint due to the enclosure size. Since the manufacturer has not published specific measurement data such as THD+N, SNR, or crosstalk, an objective audio quality evaluation is difficult. While 96kHz/24bit wireless transmission via LDAC and aptX Adaptive is a scientifically valid technology, it is unclear whether the speaker's own playback capability reaches the transparent level defined in our measurement criteria table. The 35W×4 output is sufficient for desktop use, but the overall measured performance is presumed to be average.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Supporting both LDAC and aptX Adaptive for 96kHz/24bit wireless transmission is advanced. However, this is achievable by combining existing chipsets and is a technology that other companies can follow. The use of Tymphany driver units and a full digital amplifier configuration are modern specifications, but they are not proprietary technologies that would revolutionize the industry. The all-aluminum enclosure for vibration suppression and the 4.8kHz crossover frequency design are appropriate, but it is reasonable to rate the overall technology level as slightly above the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against its price of approximately 143,000 JPY, the FiiO SP3 BT, which offers equivalent or better wireless functionality, exists for about 49,500 JPY. Cost-performance calculation: 49,500 JPY ÷ 143,000 JPY ≈ 0.346. The FiiO SP3 BT supports LDAC and aptX Adaptive and features a larger 89mm carbon fiber mid-woofer. Despite there being no essential difference in the core functionality enjoyed by the user (high-quality wireless playback), this product's price is about three times higher. There is no overwhelming performance difference or functional advantage to justify this price gap, so the cost-performance must be rated as low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As an established Japanese audio manufacturer, Kripton has a certain market track record, and standard product warranties and after-sales support can be expected. This can be seen as an advantage over emerging manufacturers. However, as an electronic device, the long-term reliability of an active speaker has an element of uncertainty. Information regarding the provision and frequency of firmware updates is also limited. There are no outstanding advantages in its support system that overwhelm competitors, leaving the rating at an industry-average level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The direction of pursuing high-quality wireless audio by supporting both high-resolution codecs and aiming for desktop convenience aligns with modern needs and is rational. Equipping it with various digital and analog inputs and packaging it in a compact enclosure is also practical. However, the balance between the cost invested to achieve this and the final retail price is poor. With an alternative available that achieves equivalent functionality at about a third of the price, the necessity of choosing this specific audio device is diminished, and it lacks price competitiveness. While the design philosophy's direction is correct, it is deemed to lack rationality in its pricing strategy.

## Advice

The KS-55HG is a product that can easily deliver high-quality wireless playback, but it cannot be recommended to buyers who prioritize cost-performance. Products like the FiiO SP3 BT offer equivalent or better functionality at a much lower price. This product is suitable only for users who find value in the Kripton brand, its identity as a Japanese manufacturer, and its design, justifying the higher price. If you want to build a general desktop audio environment, you should first consider more affordable alternatives. This product should only be considered if you find a clear shortcoming in the sound quality or functionality of those alternatives. We recommend making a rational choice that prioritizes practicality and price balance over brand value.
