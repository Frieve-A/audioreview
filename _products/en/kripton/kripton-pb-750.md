## Overview

The Kripton PB-750 is an 8-outlet audio power conditioner featuring three separate filtered circuits for different equipment types: Digital (2 outlets for PCs, DACs, NAS), Low Power (4 outlets for preamps, CD players), and High Power (2 outlets for power amplifiers). Released in October 2023, this Japan-made unit inherits design ideas from Kripton’s higher-end PB-HR3000 and employs a rhodium-plated AC inlet and OFC internal wiring. The manufacturer claims -40dB filtering at 100kHz/10MHz [1]. The PB-750 won the Grand Prix at the Audio Accessory Excellence Awards 2024 [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

There are no credible third-party measurements demonstrating audible improvements from PB-750’s conditioning. While the manufacturer quotes filtering figures [1], they are not independently verified nor tied to clear, audible benefits. Audio Science Review’s measurements on the AudioQuest Niagara 1200 found minimal measurable benefits for modern gear, casting doubt on audible gains from such conditioners in typical home environments [3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The device uses conventional EMI/RFI suppression and circuit separation—competent but standard practice. The 15A rating, steel chassis, and material choices indicate solid build quality, yet there are no clear technological breakthroughs beyond mature, well-known methods.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Using **current US pricing**, we compare against the cheapest equal-or-better option: **Furman M-8X2** (9 total outlets including front, RFI/EMI filtering, surge protection) at **89.99 USD** [4][5]. **Calculation**: 89.99 USD ÷ 550 USD = 0.1636. With equivalent user-facing functions (multi-outlet distribution, filtering, surge protection), PB-750’s value is poor relative to widely available pro-audio alternatives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Passive design and robust construction suggest inherently good reliability. However, Kripton’s support footprint is largely domestic to Japan and long-term international support information is limited [1]. For buyers outside Japan, after-sales assurance is less certain.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Filtering the mains can be sensible, but without independent evidence of audible improvements, the premium pricing strategy is difficult to justify. The three-circuit approach is logical on paper, yet the lack of objective, controlled data showing audible benefits keeps the overall rationale modest.

## Advice

Before investing in costly conditioning, measure actual power issues in your environment. For most users, the **Furman M-8X2 (89.99 USD)** provides equivalent protection and filtering at a fraction of the price [4][5]. Budget is often better spent on room treatment, loudspeaker placement, or component upgrades that demonstrate measurable and audible improvements.
