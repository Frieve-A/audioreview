## Overview

The Marantz Professional MPH-1 is a discontinued closed-back monitoring headphone featuring 40mm neodymium dynamic drivers. Designed for professional monitoring applications, it offers basic connectivity through a 3.5mm connector with included 1/4" adapter. The headphone features 180-degree rotatable earcups for single-ear monitoring and leather cushioning for extended use. With a frequency response specification of 15Hz-28kHz and 32-ohm impedance, the MPH-1 represents conventional dynamic driver technology without advanced features. Currently available through secondary markets, the product reflects Marantz's entry into the professional monitoring segment before discontinuation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

According to Reference Audio Analyzer measurement data, the MPH-1 frequency response shows deviation from the RAA v1 target curve (based on Harman Target Curve Over-Ear 2018) of -9.5dB to +5.1dB in the 100Hz-10kHz range[4]. This deviation exceeds the ±5dB problematic level threshold, with notable peaks around 80Hz (approximately 9dB), dips around 3000Hz (approximately -3dB), peaks around 5000Hz (approximately 3dB), and dips around 6000Hz (approximately -9dB). While measurement data for other critical indicators including harmonic distortion values, signal-to-noise ratio data, or passive sound isolation performance is unavailable, the frequency response deviation at problematic levels results in low scientific validity evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The MPH-1 represents conventional dynamic driver headphone technology with standard 40mm neodymium drivers and basic analog implementation. While the design appears to be in-house rather than OEM sourcing, it employs mature, widely-available technology without proprietary patents or cutting-edge innovations. The analog-only implementation lacks advanced features like DSP, wireless connectivity, or software integration that would demonstrate higher technology sophistication. Construction utilizes standard materials including stainless steel telescopic arms and leather cushioning, representing adequate but unremarkable engineering for the professional monitoring category.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Current MPH-1 price: 75 USD (retail reference price for discontinued product). The Audio-Technica ATH-M20x at approximately 50 USD provides equivalent user-facing functionality with closed-back monitoring design, 40mm dynamic drivers, similar impedance characteristics, and professional monitoring capabilities. Equipped with equivalent connectivity options and monitoring functionality, frequency response coverage to 20kHz meets transparent audio standards per measurement criteria, while extension above 20kHz provides no meaningful user benefit since human hearing typically drops off significantly above 16-20kHz and music content rarely contains meaningful information above 20kHz. CP = 50 USD ÷ 75 USD = 0.67, rounded to 0.7.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Marantz Professional relies entirely on independent contractor service centers without maintaining dedicated parts inventory. The MPH-1 is discontinued, significantly limiting future support availability and parts procurement. Customer communications indicate limited support obligations beyond warranty periods, with potential parts unavailability affecting repair viability. The company has explicitly stated no obligation to units outside warranty periods, providing only courtesy phone and email support. For older discontinued units like the MPH-1, service centers may decline repairs due to parts scarcity, leaving owners with limited recourse for technical issues.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Marantz's design philosophy emphasizes subjective tuning by "sound masters" and "musicality" over measurement-driven optimization. The discontinued MPH-1 represents basic dynamic driver technology without progression toward transparent measurement criteria or objective performance improvements. The company's focus on "holistic design approach" and emotional connection to music lacks scientific basis for sound quality advancement. The conservative approach excludes integration of modern DSP, wireless, or software technologies that could provide measurable performance benefits. This subjective methodology contradicts evidence-based audio engineering principles focused on transparent sound reproduction.

## Advice

The MPH-1 offers comparable monitoring functionality to alternatives like the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x but at higher cost with significant support limitations. The ATH-M20x at approximately 50 USD provides equivalent user-facing performance with superior manufacturer support, current product availability, and comparable monitoring capabilities. The MPH-1's discontinued status creates substantial long-term support risks with limited parts availability and service infrastructure. The extended frequency response above 20kHz provides no meaningful audible benefit for most users and applications. Users seeking cost-effective monitoring headphones should prioritize alternatives like the ATH-M20x that offer equivalent functionality with better pricing and ongoing manufacturer support.
