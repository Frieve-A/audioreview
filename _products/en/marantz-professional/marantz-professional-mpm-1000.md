rating: [2.5, 0.5, 0.4, 0.7, 0.5, 0.4]
price: 69
summary: "Entry-level XLR condenser with full bundle and respectable catalog specs; no independent lab data. With the Mackie EM-91C sitting at USD 44.99, CP comes out to 0.7. A safe first XLR mic, but not the cheapest path to equivalent performance."

## Overview

Marantz Professional’s MPM-1000 is a side-address cardioid condenser (18 mm diaphragm) aimed at first-time studio users. Catalog specs list 20 Hz–20 kHz response, 17 dBA self-noise, 77 dB SNR, and 136 dB max SPL. It ships with a windscreen, shockmount, tabletop stand, and XLR cable, making it a complete starter bundle. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent third-party measurement sets were not found at review time. From the official documentation: self-noise 17 dBA, SNR 77 dB, max SPL 136 dB, and standard cardioid behavior, which are adequate for spoken voice and basic music tracking in home studios. Given the reliance on manufacturer data only, we assign a provisional mid-score pending lab verification. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This is a conventional electret condenser with no disclosed proprietary capsule or DSP. The value proposition is the bundled accessories rather than novel engineering. It sits under inMusic’s umbrella, which focuses on cost-effective pro-audio lines; nothing here suggests unusual patents or integration beyond the basics. [1][10]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Basis (cheapest equivalent-or-better):** Mackie **EM-91C** — XLR cardioid condenser with comparable end-user function and closely matching core specs (self-noise 16 dBA [better], SNR 78 dB [similar], max SPL 134 dB [within 2 dB], FR 20 Hz–18 kHz). Widely available at **44.99 USD**. [3][4]

**Target price (this review file):** **69 USD** (representative current listing). [7]

**Calculation (display rule):**  
44.99 USD ÷ 69 USD = **0.65** → rounded to one decimal → **0.7**.

Therefore CP = **0.7**. If a future price drop occurs for the MPM-1000, CP should be recomputed accordingly. [4][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Marantz Professional is operated by inMusic. Warranty/support terms are published via Marantz Pro, with standard U.S. coverage and service through the inMusic network; details vary by region and product. No broad failure-rate data was located. Overall, average standing for a mass-market condenser. [1][8][10]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product emphasizes straightforward, measurable traits (cardioid condenser, known SPL/noise limits) and bundles the needed hardware for entry-level recording—sensible at this price. There is no evidence of extravagant, non-audible claims, but also little sign of forward-leaning technical innovation.

## Advice

For a **first XLR condenser**, MPM-1000 is easy to recommend thanks to the full bundle and acceptable catalog specs. If you want **the cheapest path to similar performance**, consider the **Mackie EM-91C** at 44.99 USD; noise performance is slightly better on paper. If you need **more headroom and a widely validated workhorse**, **Audio-Technica AT2020** offers 144 dB max SPL (self-noise 20 dBA) at a higher price; choose it for louder sources or if you prefer long-term ecosystem depth.
