## Overview

The Mytek Digital Brooklyn AMP+ is a compact Class-D power amplifier priced at **2,495 USD**. It measures **8.5" W × 1.74" H × 8.8" D** and weighs about **6 lb (2.73 kg)**. Rated power is **250W/8Ω** and **300W/4Ω**. Compared with the original Brooklyn AMP, the “+” version adopts a faster ~**650kHz** switching clock and faster FET transistors as part of Mytek’s latest Class-D implementation [2][3]. It targets high-end systems requiring a small footprint.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent lab measurements (Stereophile) show low distortion and good linearity in the audible band. Representative data include **THD+N = 0.003% at 1kHz, 50W into 8Ω**; frequency response into 8Ω reaches **–3dB at ~80kHz** with minimal loudspeaker-load modulation in the audioband, and even into 2Ω the response is only **–0.7dB at 20kHz**. Channel separation measures **100dB** below 1kHz and **73dB** at 20kHz. Noise performance referenced to 1W is modest relative to the catalog spec: **78.5dB** wideband (unweighted), **84dB** (22Hz–22kHz), and **86.8dB A-weighted**. Ultrasonic noise is **98mV**, reduced from **315mV** in the prior model. Protection engages at **210.4W/4Ω** and **103.7W/2Ω**, limiting continuous power into difficult loads [1]. Netting these, audible-band linearity is solid but SNR and protective behavior temper the score to **0.6**.

(Notes: >121dB SNR and 10Hz–30kHz (–3dB) are **manufacturer specifications** [2][3].)

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The AMP+ employs Mytek’s refined Class-D stage with ~**650kHz** switching and faster FETs, delivering **250W/8Ω, 300W/4Ω** in a half-rack enclosure. This is competent, space-efficient engineering, but not an industry-leading leap; hence **0.7** [2][3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

As the cheapest **equivalent-or-better** alternative, a **pair of Fosi Audio V3 Mono** amplifiers **with the 48V/10A PSU bundle** (to power two units) provides stereo functionality with transparent-class specs (**240W/4Ω per mono @48V/5A, SNR≥123dB, THD<0.006% (manufacturer)**) at **279.99 USD** [5][6].  
**CP calculation**: **279.99 USD ÷ 2,495 USD = 0.112** → score **0.1**.  
Given the ~**9×** price gap and no clear measured advantage at the ear, the AMP+ fares poorly in CP.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Mytek provides a **2-year warranty** and maintains an authorized dealer/service network. Firmware updates are not applicable for this analog power-amp category. Overall support appears appropriate for the price tier [2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Pursuing low distortion and compact, high-power delivery is rational. However, because functionally equivalent, measurement-transparent options exist at a fraction of the price, the overall resource allocation (pricing) appears inefficient, capping the score at **0.6**.

## Advice

If you need a small, stackable power amp within a Mytek ecosystem, the AMP+ is coherent. If your priority is objective performance per dollar, consider the **Fosi V3 Mono (pair)** first; it achieves the same end goal at far lower cost [5][6].
