## Overview

The Mytek Digital Liberty THX AAA HPA is a dedicated desktop headphone amplifier launched in February 2021, utilizing THX's AAA 888 circuit technology with patented feed-forward error correction topology. Positioned within Mytek's Liberty series as a single-function reference device, it targets both audiophile enthusiasts and professional audio engineers. The amplifier features comprehensive connectivity including XLR 4-pin, 4.4mm balanced, 6.35mm TRS, and 3.5mm outputs, powered by a 60W linear toroidal supply with dual mono regulators. At 1495 dollars, it represents Mytek's entry into the dedicated headphone amplifier market, leveraging the company's professional audio heritage from Brooklyn-based headquarters.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Audio Science Review measured the related Mytek Liberty DAC combo unit, which shares similar THX AAA technology with the Liberty HPA [3]. The DAC section achieved SINAD of 105 dB, and the headphone amplifier section delivered 265mW into 300Ω load with adequate power for demanding headphones. Third-party measurements confirm that baseline noise levels are elevated, making the amplifier less suitable for sensitive IEMs and high-efficiency headphones [3]. However, for typical headphone loads (300Ω, 32Ω), the amplifier demonstrated transparent performance with low distortion. The SMSL SP400, using the same THX AAA 888 circuit, achieved SINAD of 120 dB in independent measurements [5], suggesting the circuit topology is capable of transparent-level performance. The measured performance places the Liberty HPA near the transparent threshold, with noise floor being the primary limiting factor for sensitive loads.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Liberty HPA incorporates licensed THX AAA 888 circuit technology featuring patented feed-forward error correction topology, representing current amplifier design that debuted at CES 2017 and continues to be adopted in premium products [1]. The THX AAA technology is protected by multiple international patents and offers up to 40dB distortion reduction compared to conventional designs. Implementation includes premium components such as ALPS 27mm analog volume attenuator, 60W linear toroidal power supply with dual mono regulators, and comprehensive multi-output architecture supporting professional connectivity standards. While the core circuit represents licensed technology rather than proprietary development, Mytek contributes in-house chassis design, component selection, and manufacturing through their Warsaw facility. The technology integration combines modern solid-state implementation with traditional linear power supply approaches, avoiding outdated analog-only designs while maintaining professional-grade performance standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Topping A90 Discrete (599 USD) provides equivalent-or-better measured performance with SINAD of 119 dB (independently measured by Audio Science Review [5]), compared to the Liberty HPA's THX AAA 888 implementation. The A90 Discrete offers XLR 4-pin balanced, 4.4mm balanced, and 6.35mm outputs with XLR and RCA analog inputs, matching the Liberty HPA's core connectivity requirements. Independent measurements confirm the A90 Discrete delivers superior noise performance, excellent channel matching via stepped relay volume control, and outstanding current delivery into low impedance loads. Both products target the same use case of driving demanding headphones with transparent amplification.

CP = 599 USD ÷ 1,495 USD = 0.4

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Mytek provides comprehensive global support through US headquarters in Brooklyn and EU operations in Warsaw, offering direct manufacturer service with 2-year warranty coverage for defects in workmanship and materials. Parts availability extends to 10 years for legacy products, with reasonably priced repair services beyond warranty period. The company maintains active firmware update support, with Version 1.2.0 released in July 2022 adding output cutoff functionality and factory restore options. Build quality demonstrates professional standards with robust construction including oversized toroidal transformer, dual mono regulators, and gold-plated connectors designed for longevity. The compact form factor (140x225x44mm) incorporates substantial internal components without compromising reliability. Known issues include elevated noise floor problematic for sensitive headphones and occasional USB driver recognition requiring reinstallation, but no widespread physical reliability failures are documented. Support infrastructure includes RMA procedures with global service centers providing comprehensive technical assistance.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Liberty HPA utilizes proven THX AAA 888 technology with a measurement-focused design philosophy emphasizing scientific verification over subjective approaches. The design avoids vacuum tubes and R2R implementations, focusing on measurable solid-state performance optimization. However, cost optimization presents concerns: the SMSL SP400 implements the identical THX AAA 888 circuit at 630 USD with equivalent measured performance (SINAD 120 dB), while the Topping A90 Discrete achieves superior measurements at 599 USD using discrete topology [5]. This indicates the 1,495 USD price does not proportionally translate to measured performance improvements. The 60W linear toroidal power supply represents a conservative rather than innovative approach, adding weight and cost without demonstrated measurement advantages over modern switching supplies. While the professional connectivity and build quality are appropriate, the cost-to-performance ratio suggests suboptimal engineering efficiency compared to competitors achieving equivalent or better results at significantly lower price points.

## Advice

The Mytek Digital Liberty HPA delivers transparent performance for typical headphone loads but faces significant competition from more cost-effective alternatives. The Topping A90 Discrete provides superior measured performance at 40% of the price with equivalent connectivity. Users requiring the specific Mytek brand presence, professional linear power supply implementation, or existing Mytek ecosystem integration may find value in the Liberty HPA. For pure audio performance, the elevated noise floor makes this amplifier less suitable for sensitive IEMs and high-efficiency headphones. Professional users prioritizing measurement-verified performance over brand considerations should evaluate the A90 Discrete or SMSL SP400 as primary alternatives offering equivalent or better specifications at substantially lower cost.
