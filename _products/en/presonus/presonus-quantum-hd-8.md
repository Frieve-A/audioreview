## Overview

The PreSonus Quantum HD 8 is a 26-in/30-out USB-C audio interface released in 2024 as the culmination of the company's 30 years of technological innovation. It features 8 newly-developed MAX-HD microphone preamps with up to +75dB of gain and supports high-resolution recording at 32-bit/192kHz. A perpetual license for Studio One Pro 7 (worth 199.99 USD) is included, providing a professional music production environment. The 1U rack-mountable chassis incorporates ADAT I/O, S/PDIF I/O, MIDI I/O, word clock input/output, re-amp output, and loopback functionality, designed to meet diverse recording needs in studio environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

According to measurement data, the microphone preamps achieve an extremely low equivalent input noise of -130dBu, while the line inputs exhibit excellent THD of 0.001% (1kHz, minimum gain). The dynamic range reaches up to 124dB, with the microphone preamp sections achieving 116dB (A-weighted, minimum gain) and the line input sections 118dB (A-weighted, minimum gain). The frequency response is exceptionally flat at ±0.1dB from 20Hz-20kHz (unity gain, 1kHz reference), fully meeting transparent-level standards. While 32-bit/192kHz high-resolution support theoretically enables a vast dynamic range, measured values are limited by the analog stages. Nevertheless, the measurement results clear the transparent level criteria across nearly all items in the measurement standards table, indicating no scientifically expected audible sound quality degradation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The MAX-HD microphone preamps feature a new design based on 30 years of technological accumulation, employing digitally-controlled analog circuits to achieve transparency, low noise, and low distortion. The two instrument inputs, co-developed with Fender engineers, incorporate designs optimized for instrument characteristics. Implementation of 32-bit AD/DA converters provides significantly greater headroom compared to conventional 24-bit systems. USB-C connectivity ensures stable power supply and data transfer, while the robust 1U rack-mountable chassis design is commendable. However, the basic circuit design and converter selection remain within industry-standard approaches, with no breakthrough technological innovations evident. Features such as ADAT expansion and word clock synchronization are adequately implemented but represent combinations of existing technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The current price of the PreSonus Quantum HD 8 is 1,017.81 USD (as of July 2025, Sweetwater price). As a competing product with equivalent features, the Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 4th Gen, which also supports 8 microphone preamps and 192kHz recording, is available for 749.99 USD. This product offers comparable performance in terms of dynamic range and connectivity, making it a direct competitor to the Quantum HD 8. The calculation is: 749.99 USD ÷ 1,017.81 USD = 0.737, which rounds to a score of 0.7. Even considering the value of the included Studio One Pro license, the price difference for the hardware alone cannot be ignored, meaning its cost-performance is not high.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PreSonus is a manufacturer with a long-standing reputation in the industry, and its products are known for their reliability. Integration with Studio One ensures continuous software updates. A global support system is in place, with prompt provision of technical documentation and drivers. The hardware design is robust and built to withstand professional studio use. The warranty period is industry-standard, and the repair support system is comprehensive. The stability of the USB-C connection and driverless operation minimize the risk of system trouble.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy aimed at achieving the transparent level in the measurement standards table is extremely rational. The low-noise, low-distortion design of the MAX-HD preamps, the high headroom provided by the 32-bit converters, and the stable power and data transfer via USB-C are all technological investments that directly contribute to sound quality. The inclusion of Studio One Pro 7, which provides an optimized and integrated hardware-software environment, is also rational. However, for many users, 8 preamps may be excessive, and a product lineup with fewer channels would be desirable. Furthermore, considering its price point of nearly 1000 USD, where less expensive competitors offer equivalent basic functionality, the rationality of its pricing strategy is questionable.

## Advice

The PreSonus Quantum HD 8 is a technically excellent audio interface, but it is strongly recommended to carefully consider your use case and budget before purchasing. For professional studios that require 8-channel simultaneous recording and are committed to a Studio One-based workflow, it could be a viable option considering the integration and support. However, for those who are cost-conscious, competing products like the Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 4th Gen (749.99 USD) should be considered. This product offers equivalent core functionality (8 preamps, 192kHz support) at a significantly lower price, making it a more rational choice for many users. When considering a purchase, it is crucial to comprehensively evaluate your actual recording channel needs, budget, and compatibility with your DAW.
