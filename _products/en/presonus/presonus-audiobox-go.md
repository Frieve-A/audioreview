## Overview

The PreSonus AudioBox GO is an ultra-compact 2x2 USB audio interface designed for mobile recording applications. Measuring just 4.25 × 3.3 × 1.73 inches and weighing approximately half a pound, this bus-powered interface features PreSonus's XMAX-L preamp technology derived from their StudioLive mixer designs. The unit offers 24-bit/96kHz recording capability with dual inputs including combo XLR/TRS and instrument inputs, balanced line outputs, and headphone monitoring. At 80 USD, it targets entry-level users seeking portable recording solutions with professional connectivity options.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AudioBox GO demonstrates mixed performance against established measurement criteria. Frequency response varies significantly across outputs: the mic preamp operates at 20Hz-20kHz (±3.0dB) reaching the problematic threshold, while the headphone output achieves transparent-level performance at ±0.5dB. THD performance shows similar variance with the mic preamp achieving excellent <0.004% distortion (exceeding transparent levels), but headphone THD of <0.08% falling between problematic and transparent ranges. Dynamic range specifications place the ADC at 90dB (problematic threshold) while the DAC reaches 102dB approaching transparent performance. The headphone output S/N ratio measures 90dB, residing between problematic (80dB) and transparent (105dB) benchmarks [3], though official line output S/N specifications are not available for evaluation. The 24-bit/96kHz capability provides adequate resolution for professional applications, though performance consistency across different signal paths limits overall scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PreSonus implements their proprietary XMAX-L preamp technology, representing a cost-optimized variant of their patented XMAX design from 1995. The discrete component architecture utilizes 30V power rails (double typical IC-based designs) and Class-A circuitry for measurable noise and distortion advantages over operational amplifier implementations. The XMAX-L maintains core discrete design principles while targeting budget market segments, demonstrating 25+ years of accumulated preamp engineering expertise. The design employs discrete transistors, resistors, and capacitors rather than op-amps, providing technical differentiation within the price category. While not representing cutting-edge technology advancement, the implementation demonstrates appropriate contemporary engineering approaches with proprietary intellectual property contributing to measured performance characteristics.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 80 USD current market price, the AudioBox GO achieves excellent <0.004% distortion (exceeding transparent levels) for the mic preamp. After thorough investigation for products with confirmed equivalent-or-better measured performance including THD performance, no products under 80 USD with confirmed THD <0.004% and equivalent-or-better functionality were identified. The Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD (46 USD) provides equivalent 2x2 interface functionality, but its THD performance is not explicitly stated in official specifications. Third-party measurements report distortion artifacts rising well before full scale (e.g., clarity only up to about -17.6 dBFS), indicating THD performance that cannot be confirmed as equivalent-or-better than the AudioBox GO [2]. Per policy, products without confirmed equivalent-or-better measured performance cannot be used as comparison targets. Therefore, the AudioBox GO represents the world's cheapest product with equivalent-or-better functions and measured performance including THD performance, and CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PreSonus provides standard one-year warranty coverage below the industry two-year average. The solid-state design with minimal moving parts favors inherent reliability through simple digital/analog architecture. Global manufacturer support infrastructure operates through established PreSonus dealer networks with direct technical assistance. The company demonstrates 25+ year operational history with generally reliable product track records, though specific long-term data for the AudioBox GO model remains limited. User reports for related AudioBox models indicate typical 3-7 year operational lifespans under normal usage conditions. Construction design emphasizes robustness appropriate for mobile recording applications, with bus-powered operation reducing external power supply failure points.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

PreSonus demonstrates rational design philosophy through measurement-focused development and scientific approach to audio interface engineering. Company philosophy explicitly emphasizes "affordable professional quality" with direct cost-to-performance optimization rather than premium material investments. The discrete component XMAX-L implementation provides measurable improvements in noise and distortion characteristics compared to operational amplifier alternatives within the price segment. Engineering decisions prioritize achieving transparent performance levels within budget constraints, supported by real-world testing facilities for product validation. Cost optimization actively reduces unnecessary expenses while maintaining functional performance, avoiding subjective audio myths in favor of objective engineering principles. The design approach aligns with rational audio equipment development through scientific measurement validation and performance-focused resource allocation.

## Advice

The AudioBox GO suits users requiring portable 2x2 recording capability with professional connectivity at moderate performance levels. Consider this interface when XMAX-L preamp technology delivering excellent THD performance (<0.004%) and compact form factor are specifically desired. Among products with confirmed equivalent-or-better measured performance including THD performance, it represents the world's cheapest option. The mixed performance characteristics make it suitable for mobile recording applications where convenience and brand preference are important. It provides reasonable functionality for users who value PreSonus software integration and specific design preferences. It serves well for entry-level content creation, podcasting, and mobile music production within its performance limitations. Professional applications requiring consistent transparent-level performance across all signal paths should consider higher-specification alternatives.
