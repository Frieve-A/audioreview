## Overview

The PreSonus PRM1 is a 1/4-inch pre-polarized electret condenser microphone designed specifically for acoustic measurement applications. Released in 2013, it is positioned as a measurement microphone intended for use with real-time analyzers (RTA) and spectrographs for acoustic analysis tools. Featuring an omnidirectional polar pattern, it claims a linear frequency response from 20Hz to 20kHz. While unsuitable for recording or performance applications, this product is specialized for acoustic system performance analysis and room acoustic characteristic measurement.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The PRM1 claims a linear frequency response from 20Hz to 20kHz, with a maximum SPL of 132dB (THD=1%, 1kHz) and an S/N ratio of 70dB. The S/N ratio falls into problematic levels of 80dB or below. Additionally, it does not reach transparent levels of ±0.5dB, remaining at moderate accuracy for a measurement microphone. The omnidirectional design allowing measurement of both direct and reflected sound is commendable, but higher-tier models are necessary for more precise measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The PRM1 uses a standard 1/4-inch pre-polarized electret condenser capsule, offering limited technical innovation. No engineering improvements beyond industry standards are evident in frequency response linearization or noise reduction. PreSonus does not provide individual calibration files, which are essential for precise measurement work, forcing users to rely on generic specifications. This lack of individual calibration support and mechanisms to correct measurement errors due to unit variations represents a significant technical limitation. Compared to competing high-precision measurement microphones like the Earthworks M23, the technical level is clearly inferior. Despite being designed specifically for measurement purposes, it remains a combination of existing technologies without innovative elements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The PRM1's Japanese market price is 19,800 JPY (tax included). The equivalent measurement microphone Behringer ECM8000 (4,314 JPY) exists with no significant difference in basic performance regarding omnidirectional pattern and 20Hz-20kHz frequency response. Calculation: 4,314 JPY ÷ 19,800 JPY = 0.22, indicating severely inferior cost-performance. Additionally, the Dayton Audio EMM-6 (approximately 10,430 JPY) provides individual calibration files, making it superior to the PRM1 in both price and functionality. The PRM1 offers no compelling advantages over these significantly cheaper alternatives, resulting in poor cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

PreSonus products come with a standard 1-year warranty period. The confirmed absence of individual calibration files, crucial for measurement microphones, significantly undermines product reliability for precise measurement applications. Additionally, the long-term support structure of PreSonus, which became part of Fender in 2021, remains unclear. While specific failure rate data is not publicly available, the metal housing and simple construction suggest good physical durability. However, PreSonus does not provide recalibration services, and information regarding measurement accuracy deterioration over time is not available, limiting long-term reliability for professional use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The PRM1's design philosophy as a measurement-dedicated microphone is rational, but implementation has critical issues. The omnidirectional pattern allowing measurement of both direct and reflected sound is logical, but the confirmed absence of individual calibration files is a fatal flaw for measurement equipment. The S/N ratio specification of 70dB is insufficient for modern measurement requirements, indicating problems with design goal setting. While intended to create synergy with PreSonus's main audio interface business, the design prioritizes price competitiveness over measurement accuracy pursuit, resulting in a half-hearted position for professional measurement applications that lacks the precision of dedicated measurement tools.

## Advice

The PreSonus PRM1 cannot be recommended for serious measurement work due to its poor cost-performance and lack of individual calibration files. At 19,800 JPY, it offers no advantages over significantly cheaper alternatives. For budget-conscious users, the Behringer ECM8000 (4,314 JPY) provides equivalent basic functionality, while the Dayton Audio EMM-6 (approximately 10,430 JPY) offers individual calibration files at nearly half the PRM1's price. Both alternatives render the PRM1 redundant in the market. For those prioritizing measurement accuracy, investment in high-precision models like the Earthworks M23 should be considered. The PRM1's positioning lacks compelling advantages over either budget or high-end alternatives, making it difficult to justify its purchase. Since accuracy is the most critical factor in acoustic measurement, users should choose properly calibrated alternatives that offer better value.
