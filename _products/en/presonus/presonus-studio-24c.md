## Overview

The PreSonus Studio 24c is a 2x2 USB-C audio interface designed for home recording and small studio applications. Featuring two XMAX-L mic preamps, 24-bit/192kHz conversion, and comprehensive I/O including MIDI connectivity, it targets musicians and producers seeking professional recording capabilities in a compact format. The interface includes bundled Studio One Artist software and supports both Windows and Mac platforms. PreSonus positions this as an affordable entry point into their audio interface ecosystem while maintaining their focus on measurement-driven design philosophy.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Studio 24c demonstrates good measured performance based on available data. Dynamic range specifications show conflicting values between 106dB [2] and 108dB [1], with third-party reviews confirming these manufacturer-specified ranges. The conservative 106dB value exceeds the transparent level of 105dB. Manufacturer specifications list frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz ±0.3dB for mic preamps and ±0.1dB for line inputs, and THD+N of 0.004% for mic inputs and 0.002% for line inputs — all substantially below problematic levels and also below transparent thresholds. However, these precise performance metrics rely primarily on manufacturer specifications rather than independent third-party measurements, necessitating conservative evaluation per policy guidelines. The available third-party reviews [1][2] focus on functionality and build quality rather than detailed measurement verification, limiting objective performance confirmation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Studio 24c incorporates PreSonus's proprietary XMAX-L mic preamp design, representing in-house engineering rather than generic OEM solutions. Contemporary 24-bit/192kHz converters and USB-C connectivity reflect appropriate current technology standards without pushing cutting-edge boundaries. The design demonstrates solid technical execution with Class-A preamp topology and appropriate analog-to-digital conversion capabilities. While not revolutionary, the technology represents competent modern audio interface design with proprietary elements that differentiate it from basic commodity products. The technical implementation shows understanding of audio engineering principles but lacks innovation that would represent significant advancement over established industry practices.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 105 USD, the Studio 24c represents excellent cost-performance as the cheapest available 2x2 USB audio interface with equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance. The closest equivalent alternative, the Behringer UMC204HD at 120 USD, provides similar functionality including 2x combo XLR/TRS inputs, MIDI I/O, and comparable dynamic range (110dB vs 106-108dB), with equivalent preamp performance and 24-bit/192kHz resolution. Both interfaces offer phantom power and similar connectivity options. Since no cheaper equivalent exists in the current market, the Studio 24c achieves the maximum cost-performance score of 1.0. The 15 USD price advantage over the nearest equivalent competitor, combined with USB-C connectivity and superior build quality, establishes strong value positioning in the 2x2 interface category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The Studio 24c exhibits concerning reliability patterns based on documented user reports. Multiple issues include USB-C cable defects causing complete non-functionality, driver recognition problems affecting Studio One integration, hardware failures requiring circuit board replacement, and static clicks with level clipping during operation. PreSonus provides standard one-year warranty coverage, below industry average three-year terms. Customer support challenges include slow RMA processing times and users bearing shipping costs for warranty repairs. The combination of documented hardware problems, limited warranty period, and support service issues significantly impacts long-term ownership confidence. These reliability concerns represent substantial risk factors that potential buyers must consider against the product's audio performance capabilities.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PreSonus demonstrates a design posture that emphasizes measurable performance improvements over marketing claims. While the company highlights wide-bandwidth analog electronics extending to 60–70kHz and not limiting response at 20kHz, this extension lies outside human hearing and has limited scientific evidence of audible benefit. It should therefore not be treated as a factor that elevates evaluation by itself. By contrast, choices such as the use of 1% metal film resistors, wide voltage rails (±18V) providing ample headroom, and avoiding capacitors in signal paths where feasible represent consistent, cost-efficient engineering. Overall, the design aligns with a modern approach prioritizing transparency and accuracy, but out-of-band extension should not be emphasized as a basis for audible quality claims.

## Advice

The PreSonus Studio 24c offers good measured audio performance suitable for professional recording applications, with specifications approaching transparent levels across key metrics and competitive pricing at 105 USD. The interface represents the best cost-performance in the 2x2 category, undercutting equivalent alternatives by 15 USD while offering USB-C connectivity and superior build quality. However, documented reliability issues including hardware failures and driver problems present significant concerns for long-term use that must be carefully considered. Potential buyers should weigh the excellent cost-performance and measured specifications against reliability risks. Consider purchasing extended warranty coverage or having backup interface options available. The combination of superior cost-performance and technical merit makes it worthwhile despite reliability concerns, particularly for users requiring USB-C connectivity or PreSonus ecosystem integration.
