## Overview

The PreSonus Eris Studio 4 is a compact 4.5-inch active nearfield monitor in the Eris Studio line. It features an EBM (Elliptical Boundary Modeled) waveguide with 120°×60° dispersion, 50 W Class-AB bi-amplification (25 W LF + 25 W HF), front-firing port, and onboard acoustic tuning. Claimed specs include 55 Hz–20 kHz frequency response, crossover at 2.7 kHz, and peak SPL listed as 100 dB at 1 m on the US page, while the JP page lists 99 dB and confirms the 2.7 kHz crossover—an inconsistency worth noting [1][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Measured performance specific to this exact model (full spinorama, on/off-axis response, THD vs. SPL, max SPL sweep) has not been published by credible third parties as of the review date. Provisional assessment therefore relies on manufacturer specs: 55–20,000 Hz, 50 W Class-AB bi-amp (25 W + 25 W), 120°×60° waveguide, 2.7 kHz crossover, and peak SPL claim around 99–100 dB [1][4]. Until independent data appears, a neutral baseline of 0.5 is appropriate.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design implements competent, mainstream engineering for this class. The EBM waveguide targets controlled directivity; drivers are a 4.5-inch woven-composite woofer and 1-inch silk-dome tweeter; amplification is conventional Class-AB. Useful room-integration tools are provided: HF and Mid knobs (±6 dB), an Acoustic Space switch (flat/-2/-4 dB), and a high-pass filter (Off/80/100 Hz) to integrate with a subwoofer [1]. These are solid but not beyond current industry norms.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Review target price: 146.99 USD** (official store) [1].  
The cheapest equal-or-better alternative identified is **M-Audio BX5 D3 (single)** at **119 USD** (B&H), offering a 5-inch woofer, 100 W bi-amp, balanced XLR/TRS inputs, and a wider published frequency range (52 Hz–35 kHz, manufacturer) [2][3].

**Calculation (denominator = review target price):**  
119 USD ÷ 146.99 USD = **0.809… → 0.8** after rounding to one decimal place. Therefore, the cost-performance score is 0.8. [2][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PreSonus documents protective circuits (RF interference, output-current limiting, over-temperature, soft-start) and provides standard warranty/repair channels via its support portal [1]. Warranty terms vary by region/product; confirm coverage at purchase [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design prioritizes translation accuracy and practical room integration over cosmetics. The controlled 120°×60° dispersion and adjustable HF/Mid/Acoustic Space/high-pass filter address common small-room issues and sub integration straightforwardly. Emphasis on a front port and modest power suits desktop listening distances without resorting to non-evidenced claims [1].

## Advice

The Eris Studio 4 suits compact studios or desks where space and listening distance are constrained. Expect useful tuning latitude, but bass extension is specified to 55 Hz; pairing with a sub via the 80/100 Hz high-pass options is advisable for full-range work. Prospective buyers sensitive to objective validation may prefer models with published independent measurements—or budget monitors like BX5 D3 that currently offer equal-or-better published specs at a lower price [2][3].
