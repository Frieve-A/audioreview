## Overview

The PreSonus Quantum ES2 is positioned as the entry-level model in the company's Quantum series, a 2-in, 2-out USB-C audio interface. It supports up to 24-bit/192kHz recording and features class-leading MAX-HD preamps and an auto-gain function, developed for home-recording musicians and podcasters seeking high-quality sound. It also features an instrument input co-developed with Fender and includes a 6-month license for Studio One+.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The claimed dynamic range of 124 dB is an extremely excellent value for an audio interface, far exceeding the transparency level (105 dB or higher). This allows for capturing everything from the quietest nuances to the loudest sources without introducing noise. The frequency response is also flat across the 20Hz-20kHz spectrum, ensuring faithful reproduction of the original sound. While detailed measured data for metrics like THD+N are still scarce, the key published specifications alone merit a high rating for scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

PreSonus's proprietary MAX-HD preamp design (+75dB gain) is a solid technology that delivers low noise and high dynamic range. The auto-gain feature is also a convenient and commendable addition. However, the core AD/DA conversion and driver technologies are not revolutionary compared to competitors, representing a standard industry configuration. Therefore, the overall technology level is assessed as average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Quantum ES2 has a market price of 249 USD. A comparable competitor with similar basic functionality (2-in/2-out, 24-bit/192kHz, high-gain preamps) is the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 4th Gen, which has a street price of 199.99 USD. The cost-performance is calculated as "199.99 USD รท 249 USD = 0.803," which rounds to a score of 0.8. Considering the added value of its best-in-class dynamic range, its price competitiveness is sufficiently high, representing excellent cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PreSonus is a company with a long track record in the music production field, and its support system is at the industry standard level. Firmware updates are also provided, showing a commitment to product maintenance. However, specific failure rate data and detailed warranty information are not publicly available, making a fully objective evaluation difficult. Considering its past record, it is rated as slightly above the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The development policy of aiming for transparent sound quality by pursuing a class-leading, measurable performance metric like dynamic range is logical. Incorporating user-friendly features like auto-gain is also a rational approach. However, the product's core functionality remains orthodox, and it lacks a forward-thinking philosophy that could significantly disrupt the market. Therefore, the rating is slightly above average.

## Advice

The PreSonus Quantum ES2 is a strong contender for users who prioritize a wide dynamic range for clear, low-noise recordings. Its integration with PreSonus's own DAW, Studio One, is a significant advantage for those who want to work within that ecosystem. While more affordable competitors exist, the superior dynamic range and bundled software can justify the price difference for the right user. If you are pursuing pristine audio capture, the ES2 is a commendable choice.
