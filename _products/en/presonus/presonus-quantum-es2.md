## Overview

The PreSonus Quantum ES2 is positioned as the entry-level model in the company's Quantum series, a 2-in, 2-out USB-C audio interface. It boasts class-leading features such as 32-bit/192kHz resolution, MAX-HD preamps, and an auto-gain function, developed for home-recording musicians and podcasters seeking the highest possible sound quality. It also features an instrument input co-developed with Fender and includes a 6-month license for Studio One+.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The claimed dynamic range of 124 dB is an extremely excellent value that far exceeds the transparency level (105 dB or higher). The standout feature of this unit, its support for 32-bit float recording, is a scientifically highly effective function as it principally eliminates clipping from gain staging errors during recording. This ensures failure-proof recordings and provides a significant benefit to the user. While detailed published data for metrics like THD+N are still awaited, these two key performance indicators alone merit a high rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

PreSonus's proprietary MAX-HD preamp design (+75dB gain) and the auto-gain feature that automatically sets recording levels are solid technologies. However, the core 32-bit float recording technology of this unit is also found in competitor products and cannot be considered a unique innovation by PreSonus. Overall, the product skillfully packages advanced technologies and is assessed as having a technology level slightly above the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Quantum ES2 has a market price of 249 USD. Its most affordable competitor with equivalent basic functionality (2-in/2-out, 32-bit float recording) is the Zoom UAC-232, which has a street price of 200 USD. The UAC-232 is also a high-performance device with a dynamic range of over 115 dB. The cost-performance is calculated as "200 USD รท 249 USD = 0.803," which rounds to a score of 0.8. For a product with best-in-class performance, its price competitiveness is sufficiently high, representing excellent cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PreSonus is a company with a long track record in the music production field, and its support system is at the industry standard level. Firmware updates are also provided, showing a commitment to product maintenance. However, specific failure rate data and detailed warranty information are not publicly available, making an objective evaluation difficult. Considering its past record, it is rated as slightly above the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The adoption of 32-bit float recording, which eliminates the possibility of failure through technology, is an extremely rational design philosophy that maximizes user benefit. The development policy of the MAX-HD preamps, aimed at achieving transparent sound quality, is also logical. The development approach, which avoids unscientific claims and focuses on measurable, practical performance improvements, is highly commendable. Although a cheaper competitor exists, the price difference is sufficiently rational given the high performance.

## Advice

The PreSonus Quantum ES2 is a very strong contender for users seeking 32-bit float recording and best-in-class dynamic range. For those who have ever struggled with clipping during recording, its value will be immense. While the Zoom UAC-232 exists as a more affordable option, the slight advantage in dynamic range, bundled software, and integration with the PreSonus ecosystem can justify the price difference for the ES2. For those pursuing pure performance, it is one of the most recommendable products available today.
