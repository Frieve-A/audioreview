## Overview

Audioengine S6 is a compact powered subwoofer built around a 6-inch front-firing driver in a sealed enclosure. Published specifications include 140 W RMS / 210 W peak amplifier power, 33–132 Hz (±1.5 dB) frequency response, and a continuously variable 40–130 Hz low-pass crossover. Inputs are stereo RCA (including LFE) and 3.5 mm. The cabinet measures roughly 8.7" W × 9.8" H × 11.1" D and weighs about 15.4 lb, targeting desktop and small-room use where footprint matters. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are currently no credible third-party lab measurements (e.g., full-band THD vs. SPL, maximum output, standardized compression tests) for the S6. The manufacturer-published response of 33–132 Hz (±1.5 dB) within its operating band and an SNR of 100 dBA (amplifier) are positive signs for a compact sealed sub, but without independent verification of distortion and output limits we cannot confirm audibility-relevant margins. For subwoofers, THD around ≤0.1% is excellent and ≥1% is problematic under comparable conditions; such data are not provided for the S6. Hence the score defaults to an average-evidence baseline. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The S6 uses an industry-standard recipe—sealed MDF enclosure, 6-inch long-throw woofer, Class-D amplification, variable crossover and phase, auto-standby. The compact, sealed approach is a rational engineering choice for nearfield integration and placement flexibility, but there are no notable innovations (e.g., advanced DSP/room correction or novel motor designs) that would lift it beyond a competent, conventional design. [1][2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market price is 299 USD. Among subwoofers delivering equal-or-better user-facing functionality and performance, the RSL Speedwoofer 10E offers deeper extension (26–200 Hz ±3 dB) and higher rated power (300 W RMS) but currently sells for 339 USD and is physically much larger (≈15" cube, 38 lb), so it is **not cheaper**. Other micro subs of similar size, such as REL T/zero MKIII (8.5" × 9.5" × 10.5"), cost 499 USD and reach only about 37 Hz (-6 dB). Therefore, no cheaper equivalent-or-better option exists at this time; CP = 1.0. [1][2][5][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Audioengine provides a 3-year limited warranty on parts and labor. Warranty activation is automatic—registration is not required. This policy applies to new and refurbished units purchased through authorized channels. These are solid, above-average support terms for powered speakers/subwoofers at this price. [4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

For desks and small rooms, a sealed compact sub that prioritizes smooth integration (40–130 Hz crossover) and predictable placement behavior is scientifically sensible. The S6’s micro footprint enables setups where larger, ported models are impractical, and its published response aims for controlled extension rather than sheer output—appropriate for nearfield listening. [1][2]

## Advice

Choose the S6 when you need real bass extension from a ~10-inch-cube sub that tucks under or beside a desk. If you have space and want stronger low-bass headroom, consider the RSL Speedwoofer 10E: it extends deeper and has more amplifier power, albeit at a higher price and with a much larger cabinet. Either way, set crossover by measurement or ear (often 60–90 Hz for small satellites) and verify placement with basic room sweeps to minimize modal peaks. [2][5][7]
