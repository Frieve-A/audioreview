## Overview

CAIG DeoxIT Fader F5S-H6 is a 5 oz (142 g) aerosol moving-contact lubricant formulated for conductive-plastic and carbon-track faders, slide potentiometers, and similar controls. It uses a 5% DeoxIT Fader solution in a fast-evaporating carrier and an adjustable L-M-H valve for dosing. CAIG markets it to restore smooth mechanical action and maintain electrical continuity on sliding contacts while being plastics-safe [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There is no publicly available third-party, peer-reviewed measurement showing objective improvements such as quantified contact-resistance reduction or long-term noise improvement on faders. Current evidence is limited to manufacturer descriptions of a 5% lubricant solution and intended use on conductive-plastic/carbon tracks [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product applies established approaches—solvent-borne lubricant delivery via aerosol with an adjustable valve. The formulation targets plastics compatibility and sliding contact lubrication but does not demonstrate novel chemistry or engineering beyond industry-standard practices for control cleaners/lubes [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Current market price for F5S-H6 (5 oz): **19.99 USD** [3].  
Cheapest equivalent-or-better option found: **MG Chemicals 401B Nu-Trol Control Cleaner (5 oz) at 18.40 USD**, which is **plastic-safe** and explicitly specified for **controls/potentiometers** (cleaning **and** lubrication) [4][5].  
Calculation (explicit): **18.40 USD ÷ 19.99 USD = 0.92 → 0.9** (rounded to one decimal).  
Note: This is a provisional equivalence based on stated functions; no head-to-head measured performance exists.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

CAIG maintains wide US distribution and documentation (product page, data sheets, SDS). Handling/storage follow standard aerosol safety guidance; SDS lists typical flammability and pressurized container hazards [1][2][6]. Long-term durability metrics (e.g., cycles to failure or RMA data) are not published.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Focusing on **plastics-safe** lubrication for conductive-plastic/carbon faders is a rational response to material compatibility issues versus generic degreasers. However, the lack of transparent, quantitative outcomes (e.g., contact noise vs. cycles, resistance drift) tempers the evaluation [1][2].

## Advice

Use F5S-H6 when you specifically need a plastics-safe lubricant for conductive-plastic/carbon faders and want a single-can solution. For general control cleaning where a plastics-safe cleaner/lube suffices, MG 401B Nu-Trol offers similar stated functionality at a slightly lower price [4][5]. For metal contact oxidation issues, a dedicated contact cleaner may still be required before re-lubrication (outside this review’s scope).
