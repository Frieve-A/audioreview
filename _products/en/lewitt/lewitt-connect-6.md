## Overview

Lewitt Connect 6 is a compact desktop audio interface aimed at creators who need computer–mobile workflows. It provides two mic/line preamps, stereo aux in, two independent headphone outs, and balanced monitor outs, while its internal routing exposes 6×6 USB streams (including loopback and a dedicated mobile in/out). The computer port supports 24-bit/96 kHz; the mobile port runs at 24-bit/48 kHz. MFi certification enables seamless iPhone/iPad use alongside Android. Hardware DSP powers dynamics/EQ and a one-knob maximizer, with Auto Setup simplifying gain and processing for voice, vocals, and instruments [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent lab measurements are limited; therefore claims rely mainly on manufacturer specs. Key figures: mic preamp gain range –6 to 72 dB, EIN –133 dBV A-weighted, THD 0.002 %, and 20 Hz–20 kHz bandwidth (conditions per spec sheet). Computer port supports 44.1/48/96 kHz; mobile port 44.1/48 kHz [1]. If borne out by third-party tests, the quoted THD and noise are below common audibility thresholds for transparent electronics. Reputable reviews describe high practical gain and low noise but without full bench plots [2]. Pending comprehensive third-party measurements (e.g., loopback SINAD, dynamic range, crosstalk), we keep the score provisional.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The unit integrates dual-USB design with full digital phone I/O (simultaneous with computer), onboard DSP (compressor, 4-band EQ, expander, maximizer), Auto Setup, multi-bus loopback, and two independent mixes—all controlled via LEWITT Control Center. This is a thoughtful engineering response to modern streaming/collaboration needs. The spec’d preamp performance (–133 dBV EIN, 72 dB gain) and DSP-based zero-latency monitoring are technically solid. Notable caveat: the instrument input impedance is listed at 3.9 kΩ, which is lower than classic Hi-Z DI values and may load passive pickups; using a DI box is advisable for guitars directly into the interface [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current US market price is 349 USD [3]. To determine CP, we looked for the **cheapest equal-or-better alternative** that offers (a) two XLR mic inputs, (b) onboard DSP effects with zero-latency monitoring, and (c) **full digital mobile integration over USB while connected to a computer** (not just analog TRRS or single-host USB). Commonly suggested cheaper devices miss at least one requirement—for example, Yamaha AG06MK2 has DSP and smartphone I/O but via TRRS and without simultaneous dual-USB host operation [4]; MOTU M6 offers proven audio quality but no dedicated phone USB I/O [5]. Among products that do meet or exceed the same functional brief, RØDECaster Duo includes dual USB-C and extensive DSP, but it is **more expensive at 499 USD** [6]. As no cheaper equal-or-better option was found, CP is set to **1.0**.

(Price basis: English reviews use US pricing; Connect 6 at 349 USD confirmed on the cited page.)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The product carries a 2-year guarantee and provides an ASIO driver plus Control Center software for routing/mixing. It is class-compliant for macOS and supports iOS/Android (MFi certified) with device charging when appropriately powered [1]. Long-term reliability data remain limited due to the product’s relatively recent market life; community feedback is mixed but generally positive. Documentation and firmware/driver support are available through the vendor.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Prioritizing **simultaneous** mobile/computer workflows, onboard DSP, and simplified gain/FX setup is a rational, user-visible path to better recorded/streamed outcomes. The design trades deep metering and traditional studio niceties for creator-centric features like loopback, dual mixes, and one-knob loudness. The low instrument-input impedance is a practical limitation for direct passive guitar use and slightly tempers the score [1].

## Advice

If you routinely combine computer apps (DAW, conferencing, playback) with phone-based platforms (Instagram, TikTok, call-ins) and want easy loopback plus broadcast-style processing, Connect 6 delivers a uniquely capable package at its price. Two clean preamps, dual independent headphone mixes, and DSP help streamline production. If you do not need digital phone integration, a conventional interface like the MOTU M6 can be compelling for pure studio work. If you require a pad-laden production console and deeper show-control features, consider RØDECaster Duo—accepting its higher price [5][6]. Guitarists plugging passive pickups directly may want to add a DI box due to the input impedance noted above [1].
