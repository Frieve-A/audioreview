## Overview

The Denon AVR-X4300H is a 9.2-channel AV receiver released in 2016. It delivers 125W per channel and supports immersive audio formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. While it featured HEOS Built-in for multi-room functionality, it is now discontinued with limited official support. In terms of current technological standards, including HDMI and room correction technology, it has become obsolete in many aspects.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The measured performance does not reach transparent levels. The official specification for THD is 0.05% (8Ω, 2ch driven), which falls between problematic levels (0.1% or higher) and transparent levels (0.01% or lower). The S/N ratio of 102 dB is also slightly below the transparent level (105 dB or higher). The frequency response cannot be expected to have the precision of modern top-tier devices, which achieve ±0.1 dB. Compared to the latest digital technology, its audible performance remains at an average level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

As a 2016 design, it lags significantly behind current technological standards. The equipped room correction technology is Audyssey MultEQ XT32, and it does not feature more advanced correction technologies like the current Dirac Live. Furthermore, its HDMI 2.0a support means it is not compatible with 8K signals. While its 9.2-channel processing capability was advanced for its time, it has now lost almost all of its technical advantages.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

With a current used market price of around 460 USD, rival models from the same generation, such as the Yamaha RX-A2060, can be found on the used market starting from about 333 USD. The RX-A2060 offers nearly identical features and performance, including a 9.2-channel amplifier and HDMI 2.0a support. Calculating the cost-performance based on the policy gives us `333 USD ÷ 460 USD ≒ 0.72`. The existence of a cheaper alternative means its cost-performance does not receive the highest rating.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

As a discontinued product, future firmware updates or long-term repair support from the manufacturer cannot be expected. While it possesses the standard durability of a Denon product, the risk of failure due to age and the difficulty of sourcing parts for repairs are unavoidable. For a new purchase intended for long-term use, the support-related risks are high.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

It follows a standard design philosophy for an AV receiver of its time, with no particularly irrational aspects but also limited innovation. It includes a standard set of features that contribute to sound quality, such as support for immersive audio, but many aspects are found wanting by current standards. While it has value as a dedicated device, its design is a product of its era, considering the technological advancements since.

## Advice

The AVR-X4300H is only available on the used market, and the risks of technical obsolescence and lack of support must be seriously considered. Cheaper used alternatives with similar capabilities also exist. If you require the latest HDMI standards (8K support) or more advanced room correction technology (like Dirac Live), we strongly recommend considering a current model like the Onkyo TX-RZ50 (current market price approx. 1200 USD), despite the higher cost. This unit cannot be actively recommended except for the niche need of building a 9.2-channel system on a tight budget.
