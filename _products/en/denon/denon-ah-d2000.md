## Overview

The Denon AH-D2000 is a closed-back over-ear headphone featuring a 50mm microfibre diaphragm, magnesium-alloy frame, Acoustic Optimizer, and a symmetrical OFC cable as part of Denon’s upper line[1]. The model has been discontinued and is mainly available in the used market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Official specifications list 25Ω impedance, 106dB/mW sensitivity, and 5–45,000Hz frequency response[1]. Comprehensive third‑party datasets sufficient to judge transparent‑level attainment are limited; thus transparent‑level confirmation is currently not possible. This section will be updated if primary third‑party measurements become available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The microfibre diaphragm, Acoustic Optimizer, magnesium‑alloy frame, and symmetrical OFC cable were rational design choices for its era[1]. As of 2025, similar approaches have seen refinements in current models; overall assessed around average by our criteria.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Assuming a representative used price of 400 USD and selecting the cheapest current model with equal‑or‑better function/measurement, AKG K371 at 129 USD, calculation: 129 ÷ 400 = 0.32 → score 0.3[2][3][4]. Used units entail variance and aging risks.

Equivalence rationale (key points)[1][3]:
- Both are wired, passive, closed-back over-ear headphones (no dependency on ANC/wireless functions)
- Third-party measurements show K371 achieves target-curve adherence, low distortion, and practically effective isolation via proper seal/fit, indicating superior modern fidelity metrics[3]
- Use-case, size, and wearing style are equivalent; user-facing output capability (achievable SPL) is sufficient in both cases[1][3]

This comparison mixes used (target) vs new (comparator); used units carry variance and aging risk. Availability and warranty constraints apply.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The physical structure is robust and long-term use is possible for well‑maintained units. However, official support is unavailable due to discontinuation, and parts availability is limited. When purchasing used, check exterior condition, pads, headband mechanism, and channel balance.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Given its era, adopting a microfibre diaphragm and Acoustic Optimizer was rational[1]. Many current models now achieve superior measurements; we assess the design philosophy as standard by today’s criteria.

## Advice

The AH-D2000 holds historical value and suits collectors or those wanting to experience its design approach. For pure fidelity metrics and support, consider current products. When buying used, verify pad condition, headband adjustment, and channel balance.
