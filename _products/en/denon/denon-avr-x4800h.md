## Overview

The Denon AVR-X4800H is a high-end AV receiver featuring a 9.4-channel configuration with 125W×9 output power. It supports the latest home theater environments with 8K Ultra HD compatibility, Dolby Atmos, DTS:X Pro, and IMAX Enhanced support. The HEOS Built-in function enables wireless music streaming. Positioned as a product that appeals to users seeking to build authentic multi-channel systems, it emphasizes high quality through Japanese design and manufacturing, along with extensive connectivity options.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Evaluation based on actual measurement data shows excellent distortion characteristics with THD of 0.05% (125W, 8Ω, 20Hz-20kHz, 2-channel drive). At lower output levels, SINAD is approximately 95dB (THD+N about 0.0018%), indicating even better performance. SNR performance demonstrates 110.5dB (A-Weighted) for digital input and 112.5dB for analog input, significantly exceeding the catalog specification of 102dB. Frequency response covers 20Hz-20kHz, achieving performance close to the transparent level in measurement criteria. These measurement values indicate high fidelity to the original sound in the audible range and provide scientifically meaningful sound quality improvements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

It meets the technical requirements expected of current AV receivers, including 9.4-channel support, HEOS Built-in functionality, and 8K/4K120Hz compatibility. While the adoption of TI DACs shows slightly higher distortion compared to AKM products, it is suppressed to levels well below the audible threshold. Although advanced room correction technologies like Dirac Live are not included, it maintains standard technical levels for the AV receiver category. Investment in proprietary technologies is limited, adopting industry-average design approaches.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Against the price of 1,755 USD, alternatives like the Pioneer VSX-LX305 (884 USD) exist with equivalent functionality. 884 USD ÷ 1,755 USD = 0.50, meaning approximately half the price can achieve equivalent or superior features including 9.2 channels, 100W output, Dirac Live, and Advanced MCACC automatic sound field correction. While the channel count is 0.2 channels lower, the practical difference is limited, and the inclusion of Dirac Live provides superiority in sound field correction. Although the existence as a dedicated AV receiver is recognized, decisive advantages that justify the price difference cannot be found.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As a Denon brand with many years of track record, official sales and support systems are established in Japan. Product warranty is set for standard periods, and failure rates maintain industry average levels. HDMI 2.1-related issues from 2020-2021 have been resolved in products manufactured after May 2021. Continuous firmware updates for functional improvements are implemented, ensuring reliability for long-term use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

It is rational that the product reliably implements basic functions required for AV receivers and achieves values close to transparent levels in measurement performance. Function selection corresponding to modern usage environments, such as 8K support and wireless functionality, is also appropriate. However, considering the non-inclusion of advanced room correction technologies like Dirac Live and the technical standards achievable at the same price range, innovation and price-breaking initiatives are limited. While the necessity as dedicated audio equipment is recognized, the possibility of substitution by general-purpose equipment also exists.

## Advice

This product is a suitable choice for users who want to build a genuine 9.4-channel multi-channel environment. Its measurement performance is excellent, and fidelity to the original sound is highly valued. However, considering the price exceeding 1,750 USD, we recommend considering alternatives that can achieve equivalent functionality at significantly lower costs. In particular, the Pioneer VSX-LX305 (884 USD) offers 9.2 channels, Dirac Live, and Advanced MCACC automatic sound field correction, providing practically equivalent experience at about half the price. Unless there is strong preference for the Denon brand or particular concern about the 0.2-channel difference, it would be wise to consider more rational alternatives. If budget allows and reliability of Japanese manufacturing is prioritized, this product remains a strong candidate.
