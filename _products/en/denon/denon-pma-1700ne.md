## Overview

The Denon PMA-1700NE is an integrated amplifier with 70W×2 (8Ω) output power. Released in 2022, this unit incorporates USB-DAC functionality and MM/MC compatible phono equalizer, supporting up to 11.2MHz DSD and 384kHz/32bit PCM through Advanced AL32 Processing Plus. Manufactured at the Shirakawa factory in Japan, it represents the culmination of the company's acoustic technology. The ultra-high current single push-pull circuit design achieves 140W output at 4Ω load, providing a comprehensive solution for both analog and digital audio sources.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Evaluation based on measured data shows excellent performance. Total harmonic distortion (THD) records 0.0007% in the 200Hz-1kHz range at 1W and 10W output, and 0.01% at 20kHz, maintaining 0.0015% in mid-range and 0.02% at 20kHz even at 63W output. This significantly exceeds the published specification of 0.07% (8Ω, 70W). Signal-to-noise ratios achieve 107dB (CD/LINE input), 89dB (MM), and 74dB (MC), clearing transparency levels. Frequency response and distortion characteristics meet the transparency levels of measurement standards, indicating scientifically valid sound quality improvements can be expected in comparison with latest digital devices.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design combines high-resolution digital processing through Advanced AL32 Processing Plus with ultra-high current single push-pull circuit amplification technology. The USB-DAC section supports up to 11.2MHz DSD and 384kHz/32bit PCM, achieving comprehensive compatibility with current digital audio formats. Built-in MM/MC compatible phono equalizer accommodates analog record playback. High damping factor design ensures speaker control capability. However, the basic circuit topology remains an extension of conventional technology, with no revolutionary technical breakthroughs observed. While manufacturing quality and stable design philosophy are commendable, technological originality falls within industry average standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At a market price of 980 USD, the Cambridge Audio CXA81 with similar functionality sells for about 990 USD (80W×2 output with built-in USB-DAC but lacking phono stage). However, it is not fully equivalent due to the absence of phono stage. More comprehensively, equivalent functionality can be achieved with a combination (PC + Topping DX3 Pro+ DAC about 130 USD + Schiit Mani 2 phono about 170 USD + Fosi Audio ZA3 amp 80W about 100 USD, total about 400 USD), resulting in 400 USD ÷ 980 USD = 0.4. The Yamaha A-S701 offers 90W output at about 1,320 USD but lacks USB-DAC and phono stage, making it inferior in features. The existence of lower-cost alternatives for equivalent functionality results in low cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Denon brand provides industry-standard reliability as an established audio manufacturer with over 70 years of history. Quality control is satisfactory through domestic Japanese manufacturing, with well-established support systems. The warranty period follows industry standard of one year, with repair services available through nationwide service networks. While long-term reliability expectations are reasonable based on Denon's track record, there are no particularly superior aspects compared to emerging high-performance manufacturers. Advanced support features such as firmware updates are not provided.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

A scientific approach aimed at achieving transparency levels in measurement standards has been adopted. The design rationally focuses on improving objective sound quality indicators including harmonic distortion reduction, high S/N ratio achievement, and wide-band frequency response assurance. USB-DAC functionality for high-resolution digital audio support and MM/MC compatible phono stage for analog audio sources realize comprehensive compatibility with modern audio source environments. The Source Direct function allows bypassing tone control circuits, showing consideration for signal path purity. However, equivalent functionality can be achieved at lower cost through PC + high-performance DAC + phono stage + amp combinations, limiting the added value as integrated equipment. The elimination of occult elements and design based on scientific evidence is commendable.

## Advice

The Denon PMA-1700NE is a highly integrated amplifier with 70W×2 output, built-in USB-DAC, and phono stage. Measured performance is excellent, with distortion characteristics significantly exceeding published specifications. For users handling both analog records and digital sources, the convenience of integrated necessary functions is appealing. However, at the 980 USD price point, equivalent functionality can be achieved with lower-cost combinations (PC + DAC + phono + amp for about 400 USD), lacking cost advantages as a single unit. If a phono stage is unnecessary, the Cambridge Audio CXA81 at similar price offers 80W output, but considering combinations, overall cost reduction is possible. This unit's characteristics are functional balance and good measured performance, but advantages over alternative means are limited. When considering purchase, we recommend clarifying phono stage necessity and power requirements, then conducting function and performance comparisons including combinations.
