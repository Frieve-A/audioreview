## Overview

The Denon AVR-X1700H is a 7.2 channel AV receiver released in October 2021. It features 80W output (8Î©, 20Hz-20kHz, THD 0.08%) and HDMI functionality supporting 8K/60Hz and 4K/120Hz, compatible with the latest surround sound formats including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. While competing products in the same price range such as the Yamaha RX-V4A and Marantz NR1510 offer 5.2 channel configurations, this product differentiates itself with 7.2 channel support. Three of its six HDMI inputs support 8K, making it suitable for gaming and latest video content playback applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Measurement-based audio quality evaluation shows average performance. THD+N of 0.08% (20Hz-20kHz, 2-channel driven) does not reach transparent levels (0.01% or below) but avoids problematic levels (0.1% or above). The S/N ratio of 98dB falls short of transparent levels (105dB or above) but maintains practically acceptable standards. Frequency response is specified as 10Hz-100kHz (+1/-3dB), with measurements showing 1Hz-60kHz (-3dB). Dynamic range is 109dB, though analog stage measurement performance does not reach the highest standards. Overall, audible sound quality improvements are recognized, though transparent level achievement remains limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

From a technical perspective, designs exceeding industry standards have been adopted. Discrete high-current amplifiers are installed across all channels, ensuring uniformity of inter-channel characteristics in multi-channel configurations. Digital processing employs the Cirrus Logic CS49844 quad-core 32bit processing chip, supporting advanced sound field processing for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. Video processing partially implements HDMI 2.1 specifications supporting 8K/60Hz and 4K/120Hz, ensuring compatibility with the latest gaming consoles and 8K video equipment. However, the amplifier design itself uses conventional Class AB configuration and does not adopt latest high-efficiency designs like Class D amplifiers. Proprietary technology implementation is limited, with the product primarily consisting of combinations of existing technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Price-to-performance ratio evaluation shows the highest level results. Against the Amazon market price of 499 USD, we investigated competing products with equivalent functionality. Major competing products include the Onkyo TX-NR5100 (499 USD) with 7.2 channel configuration and Dolby Atmos support, and the Pioneer VSX-935 (499 USD) also with 7.2 channel 80W output and Dolby Atmos support. These competing products are at equivalent prices with similar channel count and surround sound technology, making them equivalent from a user functionality and performance perspective. This product is effectively among the most affordable options for the specified functionality and performance, resulting in a score of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Reliability maintains general standards. The warranty system under the Denon brand is at industry standard levels, with support networks established domestically and internationally. However, with the successor model AVR-X1800H released in 2023, there are concerns about long-term support continuity from a product lifecycle perspective. Regarding firmware updates, response frequency is expected to decrease as this is no longer a current product, but updates are still provided as of 2025. User reviews show no notable failure reports, but long-term reliability data is limited. Manufacturer warranty periods are standard, and repair systems remain at general levels. While more stable compared to emerging manufacturers, it cannot be considered industry-leading.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design approach is rational from a scientific perspective. Focus on functions that contribute to measurable performance improvements, such as 8K support and Dolby Atmos implementation, is commendable. Multi-zone support enhances practicality, and HEOS network function integration addresses modern user needs. No designs based on unscientific "audio myths" are observed, with rational technical choices made based on measurement data. However, Class AB amplifier adoption is not optimal from a power efficiency perspective. Considering the maturity of Class D amplifier technology, more efficient designs could have been possible. While price-breaking elements are limited, the design philosophy is rational in achieving scientifically-based functional improvements while differentiating from competing products.

## Advice

The Denon AVR-X1700H is a strong choice for users seeking 7.2 channel configuration and Dolby Atmos support. Particularly when compared to 7.2 channel competing products in the same price range, it offers clear advantages in future expandability and surround sound support. However, transparent level achievement in sound quality is limited, making it unsuitable for users prioritizing measurement performance above all else. Additionally, with a successor model released in 2023, consideration of the latest model is recommended for long-term use scenarios. For connections with 8K-compatible devices and mid-scale home theater system construction, this product provides practical performance. It can be evaluated as suitable for users prioritizing functionality and expandability over pure sound quality pursuit. When budget allows, consideration of higher-performance upper-tier models is also worthwhile.
