## Overview

The Denon PMA-3000NE-SP is a premium silver-finished integrated amplifier manufactured at Denon's Shirakawa factory in Japan. It includes four ESS DACs, MM/MC phono stages, and UHC-MOS single push-pull circuitry. It specifies 160W/4Ω and 80W/8Ω output, with digital inputs supporting up to 384kHz/32bit and DSD 11.2MHz. The 24.6kg chassis incorporates Denon's established technologies.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Hi-Fi News measurements show the unit outputs 130W/8Ω and 200W/4Ω, exceeding the rated 80W/8Ω, with dynamic power up to 750W/1Ω. THD is below 0.001% from 20Hz-1kHz, SNR is 110.1dB, and frequency response is within ±0.2dB (2Hz-100kHz/8Ω). These values surpass transparency thresholds in the measurement criteria, indicating audible improvements. However, performance is comparable to other modern amplifiers, not exceptional.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The amplifier uses UHC-MOS single push-pull circuitry with differential single-stage configuration, four ESS DACs in dual differential mode, and Ultra AL32 processing. Manufacturing at Shirakawa ensures quality, with measurements exceeding rated specs. This demonstrates solid engineering, but similar technologies appear in competitors, not reaching the highest industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Priced at 2,650 USD, the Rotel A14MKII at 1,599 USD provides comparable functionality and performance. The A14MKII offers 80W/8Ω output (measured 90W), 32bit/384kHz AKM DAC, MM/MC phono stage, and digital inputs, with similar THD below 0.018%, SNR 100dB, and frequency response. Calculation: 1,599 USD ÷ 2,650 USD ≈ 0.603, rounded to 0.6. The price difference of about 1,051 USD is not justified by measurable differences.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Denon, founded in 1910, operates the Shirakawa factory with high manufacturing standards. Warranties are standard, and support infrastructure is established. However, no extended warranties or innovative services stand out for audio equipment, aligning with industry averages. Reliability has a proven record, but it remains conservative compared to newer manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The focus on measurements and conservative ratings that exceed specs follows a scientific approach. The integrated design from phono to digital inputs is practical. However, with similar performance available at around 60% of the price, differentiation to justify the premium is lacking. While improvements are measurable, they do not warrant the cost difference in typical use.

## Advice

This amplifier suits those prioritizing measured performance and Japanese manufacturing without budget constraints. However, alternatives offer similar functionality and measurements at lower costs, requiring careful evaluation for value-focused buyers. In standard listening setups, differences may not translate to audible benefits, so consider options like the Rotel A14MKII. Evaluate based solely on specs and performance, ignoring brand or origin.
