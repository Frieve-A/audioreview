## Overview

The Denon AVR-X2800H is a 7.2ch mid-class AV receiver released in 2022. It features a 95W×7ch Class AB discrete power amplifier and comprehensively incorporates functions demanded by modern home theaters, including Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and 8K Ultra HD support. The product achieves acoustic performance that satisfies intermediate to advanced users through proprietary AL32 processing technology for high-resolution audio processing and Audyssey MultEQ XT automatic room correction. With built-in HEOS providing comprehensive streaming support, it is designed to serve as the core of a comprehensive AV system.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AVR-X2800H's measured performance records a harmonic distortion rate of 0.08% (8Ω, 20Hz-20kHz, 2ch drive), which falls between transparent and problem levels, representing average values. Frequency characteristics are specified in the 20Hz-20kHz range, covering the standard audible range. The Class AB discrete amplifier design secures practical 95W×7ch output capable of adequately driving typical home theater speakers. AL32 processing technology provides high-resolution processing supporting 24bit/192kHz, though scientifically meaningful improvement effects are limited. The Audyssey MultEQ XT automatic room correction function contributes to room characteristic improvements through actual measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The discrete configuration Class AB power amplifier demonstrates design robustness, but technical novelty is limited. AL32 processing technology is an application of the company's existing technology, representing industry-standard level signal processing functionality. HDMI circuitry supporting 8K/60Hz and 4K/120Hz is appropriate for the current generation but lacks advanced characteristics. Built-in HEOS streaming functionality contributes to convenience improvements, but technical contributions to sound quality are minor. Overall, this represents solid design exceeding industry average, but innovative technical elements are not evident.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Against the current market price of 567 USD, the Denon AVR-X1800H (395 USD) exists with equivalent functionality. The X1800H provides 80W×7ch output with equivalent basic functions, and the 15W output difference has minimal practical difference in typical usage environments. Calculation formula: 395 USD ÷ 567 USD = 0.697, resulting in a 0.7 evaluation after rounding. However, the X2800H's discrete power amplifier design and more comprehensive terminal configuration are recognized as differentiation elements worthy of the price difference.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Denon maintains an established support system as a veteran audio manufacturer with over 110 years of history. In the AV receiver field, they have long manufacturing experience with general failure rates at industry average levels. A 3-year warranty is provided as standard, with nationwide service networks also established. Firmware update support is appropriately implemented, with functional improvements expected during the product lifecycle. However, particularly excellent reliability indicators as modern electronic equipment have not been confirmed.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Adopting Class AB discrete amplifiers represents a rational choice balancing sound quality and efficiency. Compliance with current standards including 8K support and Dolby Atmos support is appropriate, with future compatibility also considered. However, unlike DAPs or network streamers, AV receivers represent a product category where substitution by general-purpose equipment is difficult, making the existence significance as dedicated equipment clear. While some technologies like AL32 processing have limited scientific effects, the overall design philosophy toward measurable performance improvements is maintained. Audio occult elements are eliminated, with rational approaches taken.

## Advice

The AVR-X2800H provides stable performance as the core of a 7.2ch home theater system. The 95W×7ch output can secure sufficient sound pressure in rooms up to approximately 30 tatami mats, and can appropriately reproduce three-dimensional sound through Dolby Atmos. However, to justify the 171 USD price difference with the equivalent-function X1800H, an environment where sound quality improvement effects from discrete amplifiers can be experienced is necessary. When combined with high-efficiency speakers, the benefits of output differences become limited, so true value is demonstrated when using speakers with efficiency of 85dB or below. Audyssey automatic room correction must be executed during initial installation, and optimal results are obtained through combined use with manual adjustments. Streaming functionality provides good integration with music distribution services through HEOS support, functioning as a comprehensive entertainment hub.
