## Overview

The Denon PMA-900HNE is a network-enabled integrated amplifier featuring HEOS Built-in functionality. It delivers 85W×2 (4Ω) output through Advanced High Current Single Push-Pull circuitry and includes AirPlay 2, Bluetooth, and various streaming service compatibility. Positioned as a product that fuses analog circuit technology cultivated by Denon since its founding in 1910 with modern network capabilities, it supports high-resolution audio sources and DSD playback. The unit incorporates built-in MM/MC phono equalizers, enabling analog record playback.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Evaluation against measurement result criteria shows acceptable performance. The S/N ratio achieves 105dB for line input, clearing the transparent level, while harmonic distortion is 0.07% at 8Ω load, which is between transparent and problem levels. However, THD at 4Ω load reaches 0.7%, exceeding problem levels, indicating challenges with low-impedance load performance. Frequency response extends to 100kHz, well beyond the audible range. MM phono S/N ratio of 86dB and MC phono 71dB fall within practical ranges. Overall, measurement performance is close to transparent levels but limited by distortion rates under certain loads.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Advanced High Current Single Push-Pull circuit demonstrates a unique design approach, while HEOS Built-in network functionality integration shows technological progressiveness. Support for 24bit/192kHz PCM and DSD 5.6MHz aligns with modern high-resolution audio sources. However, the basic amplifier circuitry is an extension of conventional technology with limited innovative elements. While the combination of network functionality and traditional analog circuits is rational, technical superiority in pure acoustic performance is limited. The design level exceeds industry average but does not reach the highest standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The price of 1049 USD represents the world's lowest level among products with equivalent functionality. Comparing integrated amplifiers that combine HEOS built-in network streaming, high-performance internal DAC, MM/MC phono equalizer, digital inputs, and integrated remote control, the closest competing products are the NAD C399 (approximately 2199 USD) and Cambridge Audio Evo 150 (approximately 3299 USD). While these products exceed in output power and some features, this product is overwhelmingly more affordable for the basic equivalent feature set. For users who don't require network streaming functionality, this may be over-specified, but for users seeking HEOS-compatible products, there are no alternatives in this price range.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Denon is established as an audio brand with a long history and has a comprehensive support system domestically in Japan. The product warranty period is industry-standard, and repair infrastructure is well-organized. HEOS functionality receives regular firmware updates with continuous network function improvements and new feature additions. As a major brand, quality control is appropriately managed with no reports of critical defects. However, some users report connection instability with certain network functions, so it cannot be considered perfect.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Network functionality integration represents a rational approach suited to modern audio environments. Design elements contributing to measurement performance improvement are included, and achieving near-transparent level performance is commendable. However, methods exist to achieve equivalent sound quality performance at lower cost, while this product remains with a combination of traditional analog circuits and network functionality. Configurations separating DAC and streaming functions might offer superior flexibility and cost-performance. While efforts toward scientific measurement result improvement are evident, a price-breaking approach has not been achieved.

## Advice

This product offers acceptable measurement performance and excellent price competitiveness for equivalent functionality. For those seeking an integrated configuration with HEOS built-in network streaming, high-performance DAC, MM/MC phono equalizer, digital inputs, and integrated remote control, there are no alternatives in this price range. However, for users who don't require network functionality and prioritize amplifier performance alone, more affordable options exist. The elevated distortion rate at 4Ω load requires consideration when using low-impedance speakers. For those planning to build multi-room environments utilizing the HEOS ecosystem, this product is recommendable for both integration and cost-performance aspects. For users prioritizing analog record playback, the built-in phono equalizer supporting both MM/MC represents a significant advantage.
