summary: "Released in 1993 as Denon's flagship integrated amplifier featuring UHC-MOS. Specifications include 50W+50W (8Ω, 20Hz–20kHz), THD 0.007% (1kHz/25W/8Ω), and S/N ratio 108dB (Line). The current used market price of approximately 1,200 USD remains expensive compared to modern high-performance amplifiers."

## Overview

The Denon PMA-S1 is a flagship integrated amplifier released by Denon in 1993. Originally priced at 2667 USD, it features circuit design lineage from the POA-S1 power amplifier and UHC-MOS output devices. It employs a sand-cast integrated chassis for rigidity and vibration control and adopts a BTL circuit to achieve high output at lower supply voltages. A built-in phono stage is also provided, reflecting its status as a top-tier model of the era.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Based on published specifications, THD of 0.007% (1kHz, 25W, 8Ω) meets the transparent level (≤0.01%), and the Line S/N ratio of 108dB is also strong. Rated output is 50W+50W (8Ω, 20Hz–20kHz), and 100W+100W at 4Ω (1kHz). However, modern comprehensive measurements such as wideband THD+N versus power, multitone/IMD, and crosstalk are not readily available, limiting the precision of direct comparisons with current models.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While the UHC-MOS technology was advanced for 1996, its technical advantages have been lost from a modern perspective. The design with heavy material investment, including the sand-cast frame and copper components, is appreciable, but has become outdated in terms of efficiency and performance with the proliferation of Class-D amplifiers. The dual-mono configuration and BTL circuit were appropriate for a high-end product of its time, but technologies that achieve equivalent or superior performance more efficiently have now been established. The built-in phono stage offers functional value, but its technological innovation is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

We compare using the "minimum bundle achieving equivalent functions (input selector + phono stage)." As an example, a stereo build using two Fosi Audio V3 Mono units [2][5] plus a simple line preamplifier for input selection (e.g., JDS Labs Atom Pre) [4] and an MM phono preamp (e.g., Schiit Mani 2) [3] totals approximately 586 USD. With the review target at 1,200 USD used market price, the calculation is `586 USD ÷ 1,200 USD = 0.49`, giving a score of 0.5. With functional equivalence secured, third-party measurements [5] indicate the modern bundle generally surpasses in key metrics like distortion and output.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Being approximately 30 years old, manufacturer warranty cannot be expected and repair support is limited. There is high risk of failures due to aging such as electrolytic capacitor degradation and contact oxidation, potentially requiring specialized maintenance. While Denon continues as a company, parts supply and support systems for older models are not guaranteed. When purchasing used, variations in condition between individual units must be considered, and long-term reliability is inferior compared to modern products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design philosophy was rational for 1993 but appears less efficient today. The analog-centric architecture and heavy, rigid chassis aid thermal and mechanical stability, while modern designs can achieve similar performance in smaller, more efficient packages. UHC-MOS represented an optimal solution within the constraints of its time, though equivalent or superior results are now attainable with simpler means.

## Advice

While the PMA-S1 has appeal in its historical value and high build quality, modern products are strongly recommended for pure sound quality performance. With a 1,200 USD budget, options that significantly surpass it in measurement performance exist, such as used Marantz PM-10 or pairs of Fosi Audio V3 Mono. Except for vintage audio collection purposes or experiencing the sound characteristics of that era, it cannot be recommended from a cost-performance perspective. If considering purchase, thorough verification of maintenance history and future repairability is essential. It should be understood that modern standards offer abundant higher-performance and more reliable options within the same budget before making a decision.
