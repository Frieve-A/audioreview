## Overview

The Denon AVC-A1H is the company's flagship AV amplifier and a groundbreaking product, being the world's first to integrate 15.4-channel processing and a 15-channel power amplifier into a single chassis. Designed and manufactured at Japan's Shirakawa Audio Works, it boasts an output capability of 150W×15 channels (8Ω, 2ch driven). It supports major immersive audio formats like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, IMAX Enhanced, and AURO-3D, and is fully equipped with 8K/60Hz and 4K/120Hz passthrough functionality. A key feature is its mass-oriented design, incorporating a massive 11.5kg EI core transformer and two 33,000µF large-capacity power supply capacitors, resulting in a total weight of 32kg.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The nominal THD+N specification of 0.05% (20Hz-20kHz, 8Ω, 2-channel drive), while not reaching the transparent level (0.01% or below), sufficiently clears the level where audible issues may arise (0.1% or above). Third-party measurements confirm clean output exceeding 170W with two channels driven, and demonstrate a powerful power supply capable of maintaining over 100W per channel even with all 15 channels driven simultaneously. The published measurement values are close to transparent levels in many areas, indicating that audible distortion that could compromise the master sound source is adequately suppressed.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

As the world's first 15.4-channel integrated AV amplifier, its technical achievement in the industry is extremely high. The power supply design, which houses 15 power amplifiers in a single chassis and uses the company's largest-ever 11.5kg EI core transformer and large-capacity capacitors to provide stable power to each, is truly impressive. The technologies employed, such as temperature-compensated DHCT (Denon High-Current Transistor), 4-layer board for noise reduction, a dual-core 1GHz DSP with 2,000 MIPS processing power, and a dedicated 32-bit DAC power supply, are at the industry's highest level. The fact that all this is designed and manufactured at Japan's Shirakawa Audio Works, maintaining high quality control, is also commendable.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

For its market price of approximately 770,000 JPY (as of July 2025), the functionality offered by this product—15.4-channel integrated processing and amplification—is unmatched in the market. Therefore, for users who want to achieve this functionality in an integrated AV amplifier, it is the only option. Since there are no cheaper alternative products with equivalent or superior functionality, the cost-performance rating is 1.0. While it is possible to achieve an equal or greater number of channels with a separate configuration of an AV processor and external power amplifiers, this would likely increase the total system cost and installation complexity.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Denon has a long track record of leading the AV amplifier market, and its corporate reliability is high. Flagship models manufactured at the Shirakawa Audio Works in Japan are particularly known for their strict quality control and are expected to operate stably for a long time. The warranty period is industry-standard, and with a service network both domestically and internationally, repair support is appropriate. After-sales support is also robust, with continuous functional improvements provided through firmware updates. However, due to the complexity of a multi-functional, high-performance flagship unit, the potential risk of failure is relatively higher compared to entry-level models.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design philosophy of realizing an advanced immersive audio environment, such as a 9.4.6 configuration, with a single component is extremely rational for users who want to simply build a top-tier home theater experience. The mass-investment design, weighing over 32kg, is a necessary approach to supply stable power to 15 channels of amplification and achieve high measurement performance. The convenience of connection and space-saving benefits of an integrated unit are significant advantages for users who wish to avoid complex separate systems. For users who place maximum value on the benefits of an integrated unit, the rationality of this product's design philosophy is paramount.

## Advice

This product is the only one on the market that supports the highest number of channels in an integrated AV amplifier. For users who want to build a state-of-the-art Dolby Atmos environment, such as a 9.4.6 configuration, without compromise, there is no other choice. When considering a purchase, the key factors will be whether you can accept the price of approximately 770,000 JPY and the weight and size exceeding 32kg, and whether you can actually implement a speaker layout that fully utilizes all 15 channels. If you are not committed to an integrated unit, a separate configuration with a high-performance AV processor and multiple power amplifiers is also an option. However, in most cases, the total system cost will be higher than this unit, and the installation will be more complex. If you seek the highest number of channels while maintaining simplicity, this unit is the definitive choice.
