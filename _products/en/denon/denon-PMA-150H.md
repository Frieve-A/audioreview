## Overview

The Denon PMA-150H is a compact integrated amplifier featuring the company's Direct Digital Feedback Amplification (DDFA) technology and HEOS network functionality. With 70W (4Ω)/35W (8Ω) output power, it offers diverse input options including USB DAC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Apple AirPlay 2. The design incorporates a 5mm aluminum panel and OLED display, addressing contemporary network audio needs.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

In terms of measurement performance, it achieves numbers generally close to transparent levels. Specifications of THD 0.07% (8Ω, 20Hz-20kHz) and S/N ratio 110dB provide sufficient transparency in the audible range. Frequency response covers 20Hz-20kHz, and the USB DAC supports up to 384kHz/32bit PCM and DSD 11.2MHz, enabling high-resolution playback with digital inputs. However, a THD of 0.1% at a 4Ω load, while practically close to transparent, shows slight degradation compared to 0.07% at an 8Ω load. This level is unproblematic for practical use with low-impedance speakers but is not top-tier. While DDFA technology aims to suppress internal noise, the overall measurement performance does not reach the highest contemporary standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

DDFA (Direct Digital Feedback Amplification) technology is the company's proprietary advanced digital amplifier technology, employing feedback control in the digital domain rather than conventional analog feedback. This technology eliminates the influence of internal and external analog noise, achieving more precise amplification. Advanced AL32 Processing Plus digital signal processing also demonstrates technical superiority. However, the basic power stage design and output characteristics remain at industry-average levels, with limited technological breakthroughs in measurement performance. The integration of the HEOS platform contributes to convenience, but its technical superiority in terms of sound quality is not clearly evident.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The PMA-150H is a discontinued product, trading on the used market for around 60,000 to 80,000 JPY. For a cost-performance evaluation, we compare it to current products with equivalent or superior functionality and performance. For example, the Wiim Amp (retailing for around 48,000 JPY) offers 60W (8Ω) output, supports AirPlay 2, Chromecast, and various streaming services, and its measured performance surpasses this unit in some aspects. Considering that the new Wiim Amp is more affordable and offers higher performance than a used PMA-150H, this product's cost-performance cannot be rated highly. Unless there is a strong preference for the HEOS ecosystem, more rational alternatives exist.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Reliability as a Denon brand product is generally at industry-average levels, but product-specific long-term reliability data is limited. As a discontinued product, future repair support may be constrained. The HEOS functionality is network-dependent, which raises concerns about future service continuity. Firmware updates may have also ceased, meaning long-term support is not guaranteed.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption of DDFA technology represents a scientifically rational approach to eliminating analog stage noise through digital domain control. The integration of multiple functions in a compact chassis also addressed contemporary needs and justified its existence as dedicated audio equipment. However, some of its functionality could be replicated with a smartphone and an external DAC/amplifier, questioning its necessity as a dedicated unit. Moreover, with the emergence of products like the Wiim Amp, which leverage lower-cost, high-performance chipsets, the design rationale for a relatively expensive, integrated unit like this one has diminished.

## Advice

While the PMA-150H can still be an option for users committed to the HEOS ecosystem, those seeking pure sound quality or cost-performance are strongly advised to consider other options. Specifically, a more affordable and higher-performing integrated network amplifier like the Wiim Amp serves as an excellent alternative. Unless you are heavily invested in the HEOS ecosystem, purchasing a new, modern alternative is a more rational choice than searching for a used PMA-150H. If you consider buying this unit on the used market, always verify its firmware status and the functionality of HEOS.
