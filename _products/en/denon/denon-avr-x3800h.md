## Overview

The Denon AVR-X3800H is a 9.4-channel AV receiver announced in 2022. As the effective successor to the AVC-X3700H, it provides comprehensive surround format support including 8K/60Hz, Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, IMAX Enhanced, and Auro-3D. While equipped with nine internal amplifiers, it features 11.4-channel processing capabilities. This allows for configurations like 5.4.4 out of the box, with the flexibility to expand to larger setups such as 7.4.4 by adding an external power amplifier. It's a mid-class AV receiver for home theaters, blending Denon's traditional audio design with modern network functionalities.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The AVR-X3800H achieves a good level of measurement performance. It realizes a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of 0.08% at its rated output of 105W (at 8 ohms, 2-ch driven). This is below the problematic level of 0.1%, minimizing audible quality degradation. The frequency response covers 20Hz-20kHz, which is standard for an AV receiver. However, it does not reach the transparent level of THD 0.01% or below, so it cannot be considered top-tier measurement performance. Nevertheless, independent third-party measurements have reported very good pre-out performance. With limited official detailed data on crosstalk and S/N ratio, the overall scientific validity is rated as moderate.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design incorporates technology that is above the industry average. Audyssey MultEQ XT32 is one of the company's higher-tier room correction technologies, enabling precise sound field correction with high-resolution filters. Furthermore, the option to upgrade to the more advanced Dirac Live measurement and correction system demonstrates technical flexibility. It supports HDMI 2.1, making it compatible with current major video standards like 8K/60Hz, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision. While detailed technical specifications for the DAC and amplifier circuits are not disclosed, the stable output characteristics indicate a certain level of technical competence. However, it does not feature groundbreaking proprietary technologies, staying with a solid combination of established ones.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

With a market price of around 1,699 USD, the AVR-X3800H offers 9-channel amplification and 11.4-channel processing at a competitive price point. However, a direct competitor, the Onkyo TX-RZ50 (9.2ch), is available for slightly less at approximately 1,599 USD and includes Dirac Live as a standard feature. While the AVR-X3800H offers advantages like four independent subwoofer pre-outs, it is not the absolute cheapest option for its channel count. The calculation `1,599 USD / 1,699 USD = 0.94` results in a very high but not perfect score. Therefore, its cost-performance is excellent but not the absolute best in the market.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Denon is a long-established audio manufacturer founded in 1910, with well-established global support systems. The standard one-year warranty is typical for the industry. Firmware updates are provided regularly, ensuring continued support for new audio formats and feature improvements. The company's AV receivers tend to receive stable, long-term support, and Denon is recognized as a reliable manufacturer. However, out-of-warranty repair costs can potentially be higher compared to some competitors. Overall, it provides industry-average reliability and support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy of the AVR-X3800H adopts a rational, evidence-based approach. It focuses on technologies that contribute to measurable and objective quality improvements, such as measurement-based sound field correction via Audyssey MultEQ XT32 (with the Dirac Live option), support for the latest video standards through HDMI 2.1, and comprehensive surround format support. The 9.4-channel architecture enables physically accurate Dolby Atmos object rendering, aiming for a scientifically-backed three-dimensional audio experience. The emphasis on objective sound quality improvement through digital signal processing and room acoustics, while avoiding non-scientific "occult" elements, is highly commendable.

## Advice

The AVR-X3800H is an excellent choice for users looking to build a 9-channel or larger Dolby Atmos system on a reasonable budget. It is a particularly strong contender for those wanting to create a 5.4.4 immersive sound setup with a single unit. Its expandability to a 7.4.4 configuration with an external amp also provides a solid upgrade path. Before purchasing, it is important to plan your speaker layout to ensure you can utilize its capabilities. For users who prioritize the most advanced room correction out of the box, the Onkyo TX-RZ50, which includes Dirac Live as standard and is priced slightly lower, is a worthy alternative to consider.
