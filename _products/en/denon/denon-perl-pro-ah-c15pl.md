## Overview

The Denon PerL Pro AH-C15PL is a true wireless earbud developed in partnership with medical technology company Masimo, featuring personalization capabilities. It incorporates 10mm triple-layer titanium dynamic drivers and claims a frequency response of 20Hz-40kHz. Key features include Masimo Adaptive Acoustic Technology (AAT) for individual hearing characteristic measurement and optimization, Qualcomm aptX Lossless support, and adaptive active noise cancellation. The current market price is approximately 35,000 JPY (230 USD), down from the original launch price of 43,000-48,000 JPY (290-325 USD).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Multiple measurement reviews have confirmed serious issues with this product's frequency response. SoundGuys measurements reveal abnormal peaks above 10kHz while showing deficiencies in the critical 2-4kHz region, displaying what they describe as "bizarre" characteristics. The unnatural emphasis in high frequencies combined with mid-high frequency deficiencies severely compromises fidelity to source material. Additional distortion problems have been reported at higher volumes, with distortion occurring easily when bypassing EU volume restrictions for high output levels. Despite claims of triple-layer titanium drivers and ultra-low distortion design, actual measurement results fall significantly short of expectations.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Masimo Adaptive Acoustic Technology (AAT) for individual hearing optimization represents a technically advanced approach through medical technology application. The product incorporates numerous cutting-edge technical elements including Qualcomm aptX Lossless support for bit-perfect playback, Dirac Virtuo spatial audio processing, and active noise cancellation using 4 microphones per side (including 2 bone conduction microphones). The 10mm triple-layer titanium driver design is also technically advanced. However, these technical capabilities fail to properly translate into final acoustic performance, suggesting challenges in technology integration and calibration.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At the current price of 35,000 JPY (230 USD), the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC offers equivalent ANC and LDAC support functionality for approximately 13,000 JPY (85 USD). 13,000 JPY รท 35,000 JPY = 0.37, indicating this product is priced at more than double that of equivalent-function alternatives. The Soundcore Liberty 4 NC provides 50-hour playback, noise cancellation, hi-res audio support, and IPX4 water resistance with comparable basic functionality. Meanwhile, the higher-priced Sony WF-1000XM5 at 30,000 JPY (200 USD) demonstrates superior acoustic performance in measurements, offering better value despite the price difference. While personalization functionality is unique to this product, its effectiveness requires fundamental acoustic performance improvements as a prerequisite. Given current acoustic performance issues, the product fails to deliver value commensurate with its price, resulting in limited cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Denon, as an established audio manufacturer with over 100 years of history, maintains reasonable reliability and stable support infrastructure. The product features IPX4 water resistance rating, ensuring durability for daily use. Battery life of 8 hours for the earbuds and 32 hours total with the case represents standard performance levels. Firmware updates for improvements are anticipated, with multiple reviews mentioning "potential resolution of issues through firmware updates." However, the fact that fundamental acoustic problems remain unresolved despite time elapsed since launch is concerning.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The concept of personalization functionality utilizing medical technology represents a scientifically-grounded rational approach. Individual hearing characteristic-based acoustic adjustment theoretically offers potential for optimized audio experiences. However, when the fundamental acoustic performance serving as the foundation for personalization processing is inadequate, the effectiveness of individual optimization becomes limited. Reviews indicate that "personalization functionality does not resolve fundamental audio quality issues." In a context where both advanced technology implementation and basic performance assurance are crucial, the design philosophy shows room for improvement due to apparent compromises in fundamental aspects.

## Advice

While this product may interest those attracted to advanced personalization technology, it cannot be recommended for pure audio quality-focused applications. The Sony WF-1000XM5 at 30,000 JPY (200 USD), though more expensive, offers superior acoustic performance and represents a more rational choice considering the price difference. For budget-conscious users, alternatives like the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC at approximately 13,000 JPY (85 USD) provide basic noise cancellation and high-quality codec support with significant cost savings. Should you still consider this product, we strongly recommend thorough listening tests to verify the actual improvement effects of personalization functionality. At the current price level of 35,000 JPY (230 USD), which represents more than double the cost of equivalent-function products, careful consideration is necessary given audio quality limitations. While the purchase may have merit for technical interest or experimental purposes, for daily listening applications, we recommend considering more established alternatives.
