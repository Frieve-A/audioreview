## Overview

The Denon PMA-390RE is an entry-class integrated amplifier released exclusively for the Japanese market in 2012. Carrying on the lineage of Denon's PMA series, it was designed as a product with 50W×2 channel (8Ω) output. It adopts Advanced HC (High Current) transistor technology and is claimed to achieve approximately three times the current supply capability of conventional designs through a single push-pull circuit. The input stage employs a dual FET design and is specifically engineered for Japan's 100V power supply.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Based on Denon's official specifications, the PMA-390RE demonstrates excellent performance that meets modern standards for transparency. The manufacturer reports a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of 0.01% (1kHz, at rated output -3dB) and a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 107dB (LINE, Source Direct ON). These figures meet or exceed the transparent level benchmarks (THD ≤ 0.01%, SNR ≥ 105dB). While third-party measurements from sources like Audio Science Review are unavailable, the official data confirms this amplifier's capability to deliver a scientifically clean and accurate signal.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Advanced HC transistor technology and dual FET input stage design represent a mature and well-executed implementation of Class-AB amplifier technology for its time (2012). While it doesn't feature cutting-edge innovations like modern Class-D designs or advanced DSP, the technology is proven and capable of achieving high-fidelity performance, as evidenced by its specifications. The design prioritizes a robust analog circuit, resulting in a significant size and weight (7.1kg), which contrasts with the trend towards compact, high-efficiency amplifiers. However, the technology is sound and effectively delivers on its performance goals, placing it at an industry-average level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

With a current used market price averaging around 133 USD, the PMA-390RE offers exceptional value. Its key advantage lies in its comprehensive feature set, including multiple switchable line inputs and a dedicated phono stage. To find a new, currently available integrated amplifier with a comparable set of features and performance, one would need to consider models like the Yamaha A-S301, which retails for approximately 267 USD. As the PMA-390RE provides equivalent or superior functionality at less than half the price of its nearest new competitor, it achieves the highest possible score of 1.0 for cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While the Denon brand maintains a certain level of reliability, this product was manufactured in 2012, meaning over a decade has passed and the manufacturer's warranty has expired. As it is only available as a used item, repair support in case of failure is limited. Although a domestic repair network is maintained in Japan, there are concerns about the long-term availability of parts. Modern support features such as firmware updates are not available.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design philosophy of the PMA-390RE is focused on being an integrated amplifier with multiple analog inputs, processing signals in the analog domain from input to output without digital conversion. This approach is functionally rational for users who want to simply manage multiple analog sources like CD players and turntables. However, there is no scientific evidence that analog processing itself holds an intrinsic sonic advantage; the idea of a "pure analog path" having superior value is an irrational audio myth. The product's worth should be judged on its measured performance and functionality, weighing whether the convenience of its multiple analog inputs outweighs the clear disadvantages of its large size and low power efficiency.

## Advice

When considering the Denon PMA-390RE, buyers should focus on its functional strengths: the inclusion of multiple analog inputs and a phono preamp. Its officially stated performance (THD 0.01%, SNR 107dB) meets modern transparency standards, making it a scientifically sound choice. For a used price of around 133 USD, it presents an outstanding value proposition, offering connectivity features often missing in modern, minimalist Class-D amplifiers.

If your system is built around analog sources like a CD player, tuner, and turntable, the PMA-390RE is an exceptionally cost-effective and excellent choice. However, if you prioritize a compact size, digital inputs (like USB or Bluetooth), and power efficiency, a modern alternative such as the SMSL A300 would be a more suitable option. The choice depends entirely on your specific needs rather than a clear superiority of one over the other.
