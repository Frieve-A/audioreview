## Overview

The Denon PMA-SX11 is a high-end integrated amplifier released by the company in 2015. It delivers 120W+120W (8Ω) output and features Advanced UHC MOS single-ended circuits and a CR-type phono equalizer supporting both MC/MM cartridges. Housed in a 27.4kg heavyweight chassis, this unit represents a concentration of Denon's technological capabilities. In terms of measured performance, it records exceptionally good figures, with specifications such as 0.01% distortion and 108dB S/N ratio (line input) reaching transparent levels.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The PMA-SX11's measured performance clears transparent levels. The THD+N of 0.01% (at rated output, 8Ω load, 1kHz) meets the transparent level (0.01% or below) in measurement standards, making auditory distortion undetectable. The S/N ratio of 108dB (line input) also exceeds the transparent level (105dB or above), ensuring the noise floor poses no practical issues. The frequency response of 5Hz-100kHz secures a bandwidth far exceeding the audible range, enabling transparent reproduction. While specific values for damping factor and crosstalk are unknown, given that other measurement parameters reach transparent levels, this product possesses comprehensively high scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Advanced UHC MOS single-ended circuit is the company's proprietary amplification technology, contributing to low distortion and high S/N ratio achievement. The CR-type phono equalizer supports both MC/MM with practical specifications of 0.2mV MC sensitivity and 2.5mV MM sensitivity. The 27.4kg heavyweight chassis suggests robust power supply design, potentially improving resistance to power fluctuations. However, the measured performance is not particularly outstanding compared to current state-of-the-art technology standards, representing a technology level above industry average. While the design philosophy is solid, innovative elements are limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Against the current market price of approximately 1700 USD, there exists the Marantz Model 40N (current price 2700 USD, 70W output, THD 0.02%) as a product with equivalent functionality and measured performance featuring MC/MM phono stage support. The calculation 2700 USD ÷ 1700 USD = 1.59 indicates competitive products exist at higher price, but for the lowest cost alternative, a combination of Fosi Audio V3 (100 USD, 89W output, THD 0.0008%), Schiit Mani 2 (149 USD, MC/MM phono, THD 0.002%), and Schiit Saga S (299 USD, multiple input preamp) yields 548 USD ÷ 1700 USD = 0.32. This combination provides equivalent or better measured performance in key metrics like THD and S/N ratio, with multiple input switching and phono functionality, selected as it offers the same integrated amplification capabilities at the lowest identified cost. Thus, the cost-performance is low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Denon is an established audio manufacturer founded in 1910 with a long-standing product support system. While this unit dates from 2015, the company's products generally have low failure rates and well-organized repair systems. However, with 10 years having passed since manufacture, concerns remain about future parts supply and repair support. The warranty period is standard, providing industry-average support levels. The heavyweight chassis offers excellent physical durability, but aging of internal circuits is inevitable.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy aimed at achieving transparent levels in measurement standards is rational. The pursuit of low distortion and high S/N ratio realizes improved fidelity to master sources. The adoption of CR-type phono equalizers is also scientifically valid for analog record reproduction. However, the excessive 27.4kg weight design represents inefficient material investment relative to actual sound quality improvement effects. With current technology standards, products of equivalent performance with lighter weight are achievable, leaving room for improvement in design efficiency. The limited utilization of digital technology also lacks modern rationality.

## Advice

While the PMA-SX11 is an excellent product reaching transparent levels in measured performance, recommendation is difficult from a cost-performance perspective. Compared to the Marantz Model 40N (2700 USD), it offers similar functionality at a lower used price, but the output difference is 120W versus 70W, with practical sound quality differences at unmeasurable levels. For MC-compatible phono stages and multiple inputs, more affordable options exist, such as the combination of Fosi Audio V3, Schiit Mani 2, and Schiit Saga S (total 548 USD), which provides comparable transparent performance with input switching. Reasons to choose this unit would be limited to cases where value is found in Denon brand trust or the substantial chassis. For pure sound quality and cost considerations, we recommend considering the lower-cost combination mentioned. In the used market, it may be available for around 1700 USD, but even at that point, alternatives offer better value.
