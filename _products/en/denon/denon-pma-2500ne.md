## Overview

The Denon PMA-2500NE is a large integrated amplifier weighing 25kg, manufactured at the Shirakawa factory in Fukushima Prefecture. It delivers 80W into 8Ω and 160W into 4Ω using UHC-MOS FET technology. The unit supports high-resolution playback up to 384kHz/32bit PCM and DSD 11.2MHz via USB-B input, and features built-in MM/MC phono equalizers. As part of the NE series meaning "New Era," this product has been continuously sold since 2016.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While the published specifications claim THD 0.01% and S/N ratio 110dB, third-party measurements reveal significantly different results. Audio Science Review measured the S/N ratio at 75dB, substantially below the published figure, while Hi-Fi News measured 81dB, described as "below average." Conversely, THD+N showed 0.0057% at 10W/4Ω, which is better than the published specification. Frequency response measurements indicate 5Hz-100kHz (-3dB), exceeding the transparent level of 20Hz-20kHz (±0.5dB). However, the most critical S/N ratio falls into the problematic level below 80dB according to measurement criteria, significantly deviating from the transparent level of 105dB or higher. The scientific validity is judged to be low.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The UHC-MOS FET (Ultra High Current MOS) technology in single push-pull configuration achieves peak current supply capability of up to 210A. Technical refinements include Advanced AL32 Processing Plus for digital signal processing and high-speed digital isolators for USB noise elimination. Quality control is expected from domestic manufacturing at the company's own factory in Japan. However, despite these technological investments, the measured S/N ratio falls below industry average, raising questions about effective utilization of the technology. From current industry standards, this represents an average technical level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

At the current price of 1,400 USD, a combination of the Yamaha A-S801 (900 USD) and Schiit Mani 2 external phono preamp (149 USD) offers equivalent or superior functionality and performance for a total of 1,049 USD. The A-S801 provides 100W at 8Ω (higher output), USB DAC functionality (DSD 5.6MHz, PCM 384kHz/32bit support), and MM phono input, while the Mani 2 adds MC phono support with superior measurements (SNR >87dB, THD <0.0015%). The cost-performance calculation yields 1,049 USD ÷ 1,400 USD = 0.75, indicating that equivalent functionality can be obtained for approximately 75% of the PMA-2500NE's price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Denon has established a support system in Japan and provides a standard 1-year warranty. No significant user reports indicate widespread failure cases or unusually high repair costs. While domestic production at the Shirakawa factory suggests certain quality control expectations, long-term reliability is judged to be at industry average levels. Support quality also remains at standard levels with no notable issues.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy incorporating analog mode digital circuit bypass functionality and MM/MC phono equalizer support addresses traditional audio enthusiast needs, which is understandable. However, despite the mass investment of 25kg weight and large chassis, measured performance falling below expectations in S/N ratio raises questions about rationality. Currently, products exist that achieve equivalent or superior measurement results with lighter, more compact designs, limiting rationality from a pure performance improvement perspective. While USB DAC functionality addresses modern usage environments, the overall approach remains an extension of traditional methods.

## Advice

Those considering purchasing the PMA-2500NE should carefully compare it with alternative combinations offering equivalent functionality. Particularly, the Yamaha A-S801 combined with the Schiit Mani 2 provides equivalent or superior functionality, higher output, and better phono measurements at approximately 75% of the price, making it a more rational choice for many users. Even if valuing the integrated design or Denon brand, decisions should be made with understanding of measured performance limitations. The physical constraints of 25kg weight and standard warranty terms should be considered beforehand. In audio equipment selection, we strongly recommend prioritizing objective performance indicators over brand image and choosing products optimal for your budget and usage environment. Considering long-term satisfaction, examining more rationally priced competitive combinations would be prudent.
