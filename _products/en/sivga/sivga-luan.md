## Overview

The SIVGA Luan is an open-back dynamic headphone featuring 50mm drivers housed in solid wood ear cups. Established in 2016, SIVGA focuses on combining traditional wood craftsmanship with modern driver technology. The Luan employs nickel-coated diaphragm components and a carbon fiber composite dome, powered by a 24.5mm NdFeB magnet system. With 38Ω impedance and 100dB sensitivity, it targets audiophiles seeking wooden headphone aesthetics with contemporary performance specifications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurements from headphonecheck.com [3] demonstrate low distortion at 84dB SPL with measured impedance of 40.9Ω closely matching 38Ω specification. Bass distortion increases at 104dB SPL, consistent with typical dynamic driver behavior. Frequency response measurements show warm characteristics with midrange-forward tuning and extended treble response to 40kHz [1]. However, comprehensive measurement data across critical metrics (S/N ratio, crosstalk, dynamic range) remains unavailable, limiting scientific validity evaluation to conservative baseline level as insufficient data prevents full performance assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Luan incorporates advanced materials including nickel-coated diaphragm peripheral components and macromolecular organic carbon fiber composite dome. The 24.5mm oversized NdFeB magnet system achieves 350 KJ/m³ potency, demonstrating sophisticated magnetic circuit design [1]. In-house design by SIVGA combines traditional wood craftsmanship with contemporary driver technology. While lacking proprietary patents, the integration of premium materials (carbon fiber composite, nickel coating) with high-energy magnet systems represents meaningful technical advancement over basic dynamic driver implementations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Current market price: 359 USD. Equipped with 50mm drivers, open-back design, 38Ω impedance, and 100dB sensitivity. The Philips SHP9500 provides equivalent-or-better functionality with 50mm neodymium drivers, 32Ω impedance, 101dB sensitivity, open-back design, and wide 12Hz-35kHz frequency response with measured frequency response data available [4][5].

CP = 75 USD ÷ 359 USD = 0.21 → 0.2

The substantial price premium reflects wood housing construction and premium materials rather than superior measured performance, resulting in poor cost-performance against alternatives offering equivalent core functionality with verified measured data.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

SIVGA provides a standard 1-year warranty period, below the typical 2-year industry standard. The simple dynamic driver construction offers inherent reliability advantages with fewer failure-prone components. As a company established in 2016, SIVGA has limited long-term reliability track record. Support infrastructure relies primarily on dealer networks rather than direct manufacturer service. The robust mechanical design benefits reliability, but shorter warranty coverage and newer company status limit the overall reliability assessment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

SIVGA's design philosophy balances traditional wood craftsmanship with contemporary driver technology. While significant cost allocation goes toward solid wood housing construction and traditional finishing processes, the driver materials demonstrate technical consideration through carbon fiber dome, nickel coating, and high-energy NdFeB magnet systems. The philosophy combines aesthetic appeal with meaningful technical implementation, though lacks measurement-focused optimization and advanced technology integration that could achieve superior performance at equivalent cost.

## Advice

The SIVGA Luan appeals primarily to users prioritizing wood construction aesthetics and premium materials. However, equivalent core audio functionality exists at substantially lower prices through products like the Philips SHP9500 (75 USD) which offers verified measured performance data. Consider the Luan only if wooden housing construction and premium driver materials justify the 4.8x price premium over functionally equivalent alternatives. For performance-focused purchases, explore options offering equivalent measured specifications and functionality at significantly lower cost.
