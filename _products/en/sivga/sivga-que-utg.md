## Overview

The SIVGA Que UTG is a canal-type earphone released in May 2025 by SIVGA (Dongguan Siweige Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.), a Chinese manufacturer. It features the world's first Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG) diaphragm in a 10mm dynamic driver, utilizing innovative glass diaphragm technology from Japan's NEG Corporation. The design combines a green sandalwood faceplate with a zinc alloy shell for a premium appearance, and offers easy drivability with 32Ω impedance and 103dB sensitivity. It includes modular cables with 3.5mm/4.4mm connectors and a 0.78mm 2pin interface, marketed at 107 USD. This ambitious model aims for differentiation through a V-shaped sound signature and world-first technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Regarding the measured performance of the SIVGA Que UTG, the adoption of NEG's Ultra-Thin Glass diaphragm is theoretically expected to yield excellent characteristics. The high elastic modulus of glass is said to reduce vibration and distortion, improving transient response and high-frequency detail reproduction. Covering the basic 20Hz-20kHz frequency range, its 32Ω impedance and 103dB sensitivity contribute to transparency in terms of drivability. However, detailed measurement data such as specific THD values, SNR, and crosstalk are limited. Furthermore, the V-shaped sound signature suggests a deviation from frequency response flatness (±0.5dB) from a fidelity perspective. While improvements in transient response from the glass diaphragm may have audible effects, achieving transparency across the entire frequency band is questionable.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The implementation of the world's first Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG) diaphragm technology is evaluated as a groundbreaking technological innovation in the industry. The glass diaphragm, developed in collaboration with Japan's NEG Corporation, realizes physical characteristics that surpass conventional plastic-based materials, and the design, which balances the rigidity and lightness of glass, is technically very advanced. The integration technology into a 10mm dynamic driver unit, the modular design with a 0.78mm 2pin connector, and the implementation of dual-output compatible cables also demonstrate a solid technical level. The resonance control through the combination of a zinc alloy shell and a sandalwood faceplate also shows technical consideration. However, despite introducing a world-first technology, the single dynamic driver configuration is conservative and has technical limitations compared to more advanced hybrid configurations or multi-driver technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

As a competitive product with equivalent or superior functionality and performance to the SIVGA Que UTG (107 USD), we select the Moondrop Chu II (approx. 21 USD). The Chu II also features a 10mm dynamic driver, is compatible with replaceable cables, has a metal housing, and provides excellent measured performance, with no inferior aspects in the basic audio functions compared to the SIVGA Que UTG.

Cost-performance is evaluated based on the following calculation:

`21 USD (Moondrop Chu II) ÷ 107 USD (SIVGA Que UTG) = 0.200`

This rounds to 0.2. This calculation results from dividing the price of the cheapest product with equivalent functionality and measured performance (Moondrop Chu II) by the price of the review target product (SIVGA Que UTG). While the world's-first glass diaphragm technology is indeed innovative, the price premium of approximately five times is excessive relative to the substantial sound quality improvement for the end-user. The current situation where equivalent basic audio functionality can be obtained at one-fifth the price presents a serious issue from a cost-performance perspective.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

SIVGA, established in 2016 with an approximately 9-year track record, is in a transitional period from a startup to a mid-tier manufacturer. While the company has built a certain market実績 with its previous products, objective data on long-term reliability is limited. Although the adoption of the innovative glass diaphragm technology is expected to improve physical durability compared to conventional plastic-based diaphragms, long-term durability data against temperature/humidity changes and drop impacts is insufficient. The combined structure of a wooden faceplate and metal shell includes risks of aging deterioration at the joints of dissimilar materials. Furthermore, the support system is not as established as those of major industry players, leaving concerns about long-term support such as repairs and firmware updates. These points lead to an evaluation slightly below the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design philosophy of the SIVGA Que UTG aims for scientific sound quality improvement through the implementation of the world's first Ultra-Thin Glass diaphragm technology, which is an extremely rational approach. The vibration control and distortion reduction due to the high elastic modulus of glass, and the improvement of transient characteristics, could provide measurable physical advantages. The adoption of NEG's diaphragm can be evaluated as a choice based on technical grounds. However, the adoption of a V-shaped sound signature prioritizes musical preference over fidelity to the original sound, which contradicts the pursuit of scientific transparency. Additionally, the conservatism of sticking to a single dynamic driver configuration despite introducing a world-first technology, and elements focused on appearance like the wooden faceplate, result in a design philosophy that mixes scientific rationality with commercial considerations. The non-adoption of digital signal processing or active technologies is also limited from a modern sound quality improvement approach. While the commitment to technological innovation is commendable, the overall rationality remains moderate.

## Advice

For those considering the SIVGA Que UTG, we strongly recommend first establishing a clear value perspective on the world's-first glass diaphragm technology. If pure sound quality performance (fidelity to the master recording) is the top priority, products like the Moondrop Chu II (approx. 21 USD) offer equivalent basic functionality at a significantly lower cost. However, for those with an interest in the latest technology, a desire to support innovative approaches, and an appreciation for differentiated products, there is a certain significance in experiencing this world-first technology. It is essential to audition the product before purchase to confirm whether the sound quality characteristics of the glass diaphragm match personal preferences. Particularly for advanced users who value transparency in the high-frequency range and the improvement of transient characteristics, it is worth considering from a technical interest perspective. However, for those who prioritize cost-performance or are considering it for long-term use as their main device, a careful comparison with more established options is recommended. An appropriate evaluation and setting of expectations for this world-first technology are crucial.
