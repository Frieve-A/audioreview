## Overview

The SIVGA P2 PRO is a planar magnetic headphone featuring what is claimed to be the industry's first sapphire-aluminum composite diaphragm. It features a wooden enclosure made from red oak and a large 97×76mm driver manufactured using a 28nm fabrication process and deep ultraviolet lithography for precision. With an impedance of 32Ω and a sensitivity of 98dB±3dB, it offers easy-to-drive specifications and aims for a natural soundstage through its open-back design. Weighing 435g, it is standard for planar magnetic headphones and comes with a 4.4mm balanced cable and various adapters.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While planar magnetic technology theoretically enables low distortion performance with THD below 0.05%, the disclosure of specific measurement data is limited. The frequency response covers a wide band from 20Hz to 40kHz, but deviation specifications in ±dB are not provided, making it impossible to confirm achievement of the transparent level (±0.5dB) from the measurement standards table. The sensitivity of 98dB±3dB is adequate, but detailed measurements such as an S/N ratio above 100dB, crosstalk below -70dB, and a dynamic range above 105dB are unknown. Although sapphire diaphragm technology theoretically offers distortion reduction, there is insufficient backing from objective third-party measurement data, and the actual auditory improvement remains unconfirmed. Considering the physical characteristics of planar magnetic drivers, the design approach is scientifically valid, but the lack of measurement data significantly limits the evaluation of its scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The claimed industry-first sapphire-aluminum composite diaphragm represents a notable technological innovation. The adoption of a 28nm manufacturing process and deep ultraviolet lithography technology achieves a level of precision beyond conventional planar magnetic drivers. The dual-sided magnetic array and airflow management through 108 acoustic ventilation holes also constitute a rational design. The CNC precision machining of the red oak enclosure and the gunmetal oxidation surface treatment demonstrate high manufacturing precision. However, technological elements other than the driver do not show innovation significantly exceeding industry standards, placing the overall technology level at a high standard but not at the highest level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Against the SIVGA P2 PRO's price of 79,800 JPY, the HiFiMan Sundara is available with equivalent or superior performance at 28,800 JPY. The cost-performance calculation is: 28,800 JPY ÷ 79,800 JPY = 0.361, which rounds to 0.4. While the Sundara has an 80mm circular diaphragm, different from the P2 PRO's 97×76mm one, it features Stealth Magnet technology for superior resolution, is lighter (342g vs 435g), and demonstrates objectively excellent performance in many measurements. For an even more affordable option, the Fostex T50RP mk3 (approx. 20,000 JPY) exists, but considering overall performance, the Sundara is the most appropriate practical comparison. While the sapphire diaphragm technology is innovative, a sound quality improvement justifying the price difference (approximately 2.8 times) cannot be confirmed from measurement data.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While SIVGA, as an established audio manufacturer, provides standard warranty services, no information confirming particularly excellent reliability records or support systems was found. Product failure rates and MTBF data are not disclosed, leaving insufficient information to judge long-term reliability. The warranty period and repair system are presumed to be at industry-standard levels, but the long-term durability of the emerging sapphire diaphragm technology lacks a track record, leaving unknown factors. While not a new manufacturer, no notable advantages in terms of reliability are apparent.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The scientific approach of reducing distortion via a sapphire diaphragm is rational. The adoption of planar magnetic technology and the acoustic design with a large driver are also theoretically sound. The utilization of a 28nm manufacturing process is an advanced application of semiconductor technology in the audio field. There are no occult claims or unscientific promotional phrases, and the commitment to measurable performance improvement is commendable. However, its innovative advantages over existing planar magnetic products are not clear, raising questions about the cost-effectiveness of the sound quality improvement relative to the technology invested. While its existence as a dedicated audio device is recognized, its rationality commensurate with its price is questionable.

## Advice

While the SIVGA P2 PRO showcases technological ambition and high manufacturing quality, its price of 79,800 JPY is difficult to recommend considering the current market. The HiFiMan Sundara (28,800 JPY), equipped with equivalent planar magnetic technology, demonstrates superior performance in objective measurement data at about one-third of the P2 PRO's price. For those on a tighter budget, the Fostex T50RP mk3 (approx. 20,000 JPY), also known for being modifiable, is an option. With a budget of 79,800 JPY, proven alternatives like the HiFiMan Edition XS (approx. 55,000 JPY) combined with a portable amplifier, or the Audeze LCD-2 Classic (approx. 120,000 JPY), offer superior objective performance based on measurement data. Although the sapphire diaphragm is an interesting innovation, its sound quality improvement commensurate with the price difference has not been objectively proven at present. For beginners to planar magnetic headphones, a rational approach is to first experience the benefits of the core technology with the Sundara and then consider higher-end models once specific sound quality requirements become clear.
