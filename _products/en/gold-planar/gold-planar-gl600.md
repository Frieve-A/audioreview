## Overview

The Gold Planar GL600 represents the company's entry into reference-grade headphone manufacturing, utilizing their proprietary Nano-Membrane 66mm planar magnetic drivers. Gold Planar began as an OEM transducer manufacturer serving established headphone brands since 2010, officially launching their own brand in 2017. The GL600 features aerospace-grade aluminum construction, open-back design, and detachable cable connectivity, positioned as a reference tuning headphone for natural sound reproduction at the 179.99 USD price point.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications list THD of 0.25% at 1kHz/100dB SPL, positioning performance between problematic (0.5%) and excellent (0.05%) levels for headphones. Frequency response specified as 6Hz-50kHz with 22-ohm impedance and 100dB sensitivity. However, no credible third-party measurement data is available for independent verification of claimed performance. Conservative evaluation applied due to reliance on manufacturer specifications, as actual measured performance may differ from published values.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Gold Planar demonstrates significant technical advancement through proprietary Nano-Membrane technology with modified internal driver plates for increased surface area and airflow. The company's background as OEM manufacturer for established brands provides substantial technical expertise foundation. Driver technology attracts adoption by other manufacturers, indicating desirability and competitive advantage. In-house driver design and nano-membrane implementation represent contemporary planar magnetic advancement, though limited to analog/mechanical integration without digital enhancement capabilities.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

At 179.99 USD, the GL600 competes against the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x at 150 USD, which provides equivalent-or-better scientific validity performance. While GL600 claims THD 0.25% (1kHz/100dB SPL), the ATH-M50x achieves THD 0.1% or below according to manufacturer specifications, demonstrating 2.5x superior distortion characteristics [5]. For frequency response, GL600's 6Hz-50kHz specification is broader than ATH-M50x's 15Hz-28kHz, though both provide practically equivalent performance for real-world audio reproduction. Both products provide equivalent user functions (Over-Ear headphone audio reproduction) while the ATH-M50x delivers proven industry-standard performance with established track record at lower cost. CP = 150 USD ÷ 179.99 USD = 0.83. The GL600 faces a significant cost-performance disadvantage against proven headphone alternatives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

1-year warranty coverage on products with 3-month cable warranty represents typical industry practice. Aerospace-grade aluminum construction suggests durability, though user reports indicate severe clamping force issues causing discomfort after 5 minutes of use, requiring manual frame adjustment. Dealer-based support system provides reasonable coverage, and Gold Planar's established manufacturing track record supports reliability expectations. However, shorter cable warranty and comfort issues noted by users impact overall reliability assessment for extended use scenarios.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Gold Planar's reference tuning approach aligns with scientific sound reproduction principles. Investment in proprietary nano-membrane technology demonstrates meaningful innovation toward improved driver responsiveness and frequency response. Aerospace-grade materials provide rational cost allocation for durability at the price point. Company's progression from OEM manufacturing to proprietary design shows logical advancement utilizing accumulated expertise. Design philosophy emphasizes measurable performance improvements through driver technology rather than subjective enhancements, supporting rational development direction.

## Advice

For users seeking reference tuning headphones, the GL600 offers solid construction and proprietary driver technology, though direct measurement verification remains unavailable. Consider the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x as a lower-cost alternative with established manufacturer specifications. The ATH-M50x is widely used as an industry standard and provides superior distortion characteristics (THD 0.1% or below) and practical frequency response (15Hz-28kHz) at 150 USD [5]. Potential buyers should expect initial clamping force adjustment requirements and carefully evaluate whether proprietary driver claims justify a 20% price premium over proven industry standards like the ATH-M50x.
