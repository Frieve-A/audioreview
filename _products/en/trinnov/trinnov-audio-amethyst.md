## Overview

The Trinnov Audio Amethyst is a flagship stereo preamplifier developed by French company Trinnov Audio. It is positioned as a product that integrates a 24bit/192kHz DAC, network renderer, and advanced speaker/room optimization system called "Trinnov Optimizer" into a single chassis. The company has leveraged its 15 years of experience in professional audio, applying technology used in approximately 2000 studios and about 10000 high-performance installations to consumer applications. It claims to achieve over 320dB resolution through 64-bit floating-point processing, eliminating signal loss in digital volume control.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Amethyst receives a moderate rating for scientific validity. While the 320dB resolution achieved through 64-bit floating-point processing is theoretically excellent, its impact on actual audibility is limited. The 24bit/192kHz DAC processing capability represents standard modern performance that reaches transparency levels but offers no outstanding advantages. The Trinnov Optimizer's room correction technology provides time and frequency domain measurement and correction functions using 3D microphones, which could potentially deliver audibly meaningful improvements. However, without published specific THD, SNR, and frequency response measurement data, it is impossible to confirm transparency level achievement. The active crossover function enables 2-way biamp driving and subwoofer integration, but similar functions are available in other products.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Trinnov Amethyst deserves high marks for technology level. The 64-bit floating-point DSP processing is technically advanced, and achieving 320dB resolution represents excellent engineering design. Trinnov Optimizer is the result of 15 years of research and development, and the spatial measurement technology using 3D microphones combined with proprietary room correction algorithms demonstrates advanced technical standards in the industry. The design capability to integrate 12-input preamplifier function, HybriD Phono Preamp, network renderer, 24bit/192kHz DAC, and 2-way active crossover engine into a single chassis is technically commendable. Wi-Fi connectivity and Roon Ready support also meet modern requirements. The in-house design and manufacturing system in France demonstrates technical independence. However, basic DAC performance and amplifier design cannot be considered innovative compared to other companies' latest technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The Trinnov Amethyst (10000 USD) receives an extremely low cost-performance rating. Compared to the miniDSP SHD Studio (949 USD) which provides equivalent or superior functionality, the calculation 949 USD รท 10000 USD = 0.0949, which rounds to 0.1. The miniDSP SHD Studio offers 32-bit floating-point SHARC DSP, 120dB dynamic range, 0.0003% THD+N, Dirac Live room correction, Roon Ready support, 10-band parametric EQ, and 48dB/octave crossover functions, delivering equivalent or superior functionality and performance from a user perspective at approximately one-tenth the price. Both products feature room correction, streaming functions, multichannel DSP processing, and digital/analog inputs/outputs, with limited practical differences. While there are differences in Trinnov's proprietary 3D microphone measurement technology and brand value, there is no objective evidence to justify the 10000 USD price difference in terms of final sound quality improvement results.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Trinnov Audio's reliability and support are at a good level. Since October 2017, they have provided 5-year warranties on premium products, including the Altitude 16, 32, 48ext series and latest products. In-house design and manufacturing in France ensures thorough quality control, and their 15-year track record in professional audio provides a foundation for reliability. In actual user experience, there is a case where a power supply failure in an ST2 unit after 13 years of use was repaired for only parts costs and minimal labor charges despite being out of warranty, confirming their long-term support commitment. Their adoption record in approximately 2000 studios and 10000 high-performance installations worldwide demonstrates industry reliability. However, long-term data as consumer products is limited, and reliability in different usage environments from professional applications may vary in evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Trinnov Amethyst receives a low rating for design philosophy rationality. While the integration of advanced room correction technology is rational, the 10000 USD price setting is irrational from a modern perspective. With the miniDSP SHD Studio providing equivalent functionality for 949 USD, the existence value as dedicated audio equipment becomes replaceable by combinations of general-purpose equipment. While 64-bit floating-point processing and 320dB resolution are technically excellent, their cost-effectiveness in actual auditory improvements is questionable. The approach remains committed to traditional high-priced dedicated equipment rather than embracing trends toward low-cost realization through latest software signal processing technology and AI utilization, lacking rationality. While modern elements like Roon Ready support and Wi-Fi functionality are commendable, the fundamental value proposition lacks scientific basis. Dependence on unmeasurable effects and lack of data showing objective superiority demonstrate irrationality in design philosophy.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the Trinnov Audio Amethyst, we strongly recommend first comparing functionality with the miniDSP SHD Studio (949 USD). Both products provide room correction, streaming functions, and multichannel DSP processing, with no significant difference expected in practical sound quality improvement effects. The Amethyst's 10000 USD price is excessively high relative to objective performance improvements. Even if you find special value in Trinnov's proprietary 3D microphone measurement technology, carefully consider whether its effects can justify a 10-fold price difference. We recommend making decisions based on scientific evidence rather than being swayed by the prestige of high-end audio brands. Even with ample budget, a combination of miniDSP SHD Studio and high-quality power amplifiers would achieve more rational sound quality improvements. Ultimately, avoid making expensive investments without actual auditory confirmation through blind testing.
