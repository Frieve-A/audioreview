## Overview

The Trinnov Altitude-32 is the reference 32-channel AV processor designed for demanding immersive audio environments. It natively supports Dolby Atmos, DTS:X Pro, Auro-3D, and more, with 192kHz/24-bit processing and 64-bit floating-point arithmetic. Based on an Intel multi-core platform running TrinnovOS and equipped with ESS Sabre Pro DACs, it leverages proprietary Loudspeaker/Room Optimizer and 3D Loudspeaker Remapping to deliver an unparalleled surround sound experience for users who truly need 32 channels. 

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Altitude-32’s ESS Sabre Pro DACs (e.g., ES9028PRO/ES9039Q2M) achieve dynamic ranges of up to 130 dB and THD+N down to –120 dB (0.0001%), far exceeding transparency thresholds. Combined with 192kHz/24-bit and 64-bit floating-point DSP, it ensures almost perfect fidelity to the source signal, providing scientifically measurable improvements. 

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Operating on an Intel multi-core hardware platform rather than a conventional DSP, running TrinnovOS with pure software upgrades, and implementing advanced 3D remapping algorithms, the Altitude-32 represents the pinnacle of AV processor design and sets an industry benchmark. 

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Priced at 29,000 USD, no other AV processor offers true 32-channel native processing with comparable measurement performance. As there are no equal-or-better alternatives, Altitude-32 effectively represents the world’s cheapest option for its class, yielding a cost-performance rating of 1.0. 

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Trinnov provides a standard 5-year transferable warranty and offers an extended 5-year warranty program, including a full inspection and refresh at Trinnov facilities. This level of post-purchase support underscores the product’s long-term reliability. 

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The software-based upgradeable architecture, high channel count for immersive formats, and measurement-driven optimization tools demonstrate a scientifically grounded, future-proof design philosophy tailored to professional and high-end use cases. 

## Advice

For installations that genuinely require 32-channel processing—such as large-scale home theaters or professional venues—the Altitude-32 stands alone as the only viable solution. If 32 channels are not essential, consider more cost-effective alternatives like the Altitude-16 or other 16-channel processors paired with external matrixing, which can still deliver a compelling immersive experience. Assess your channel requirements and room configuration carefully before investing.
