## Overview

The Trinnov Audio Ovation2 is a professional digital cinema processor developed by French company Trinnov Audio. It features the company's proprietary advanced room correction technology and measurement system, designed for acoustic optimization in movie theaters and professional studios. Positioned as a next-generation device that inherits the excellent functions of the previous Ovation model while achieving higher precision and stability. It has adoption records in major movie theater chains worldwide and is said to demonstrate its power particularly in acoustically challenging environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

It records excellent values in measured performance. The A/D conversion specifications of S/N ratio 119dBA and THD+N -103dB significantly exceed the transparent level in the measurement criteria table (S/N ratio 105dB or higher, THD+N 0.01% or lower). Particularly, THD+N -103dB (approximately 0.0007%) is an excellent value that sufficiently falls below the audible threshold. Frequency response is also capable of reproduction within 20Hz-20kHz±0.5dB, showing high scientific validity from the perspective of fidelity to master sources. The measurement results are comparable to the latest digital technology standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

It features proprietary room correction technology and crossover calibration engine, boasting high technical standards in the industry. It acquires and analyzes individual driver and system measurements, executing comprehensive acoustic analysis including impulse response, delay, and gain. Adaptive pre-emphasis functionality is also implemented to reduce the influence of external noise in low-frequency measurements. All audio boards are designed and manufactured in-house, contributing to maintaining world-class fidelity. However, the basic digital signal processing technology itself remains within industry standard ranges.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At approximately 9,900 USD (about 1.5 million yen), the functionally equivalent Monolith HTP-1 is available for 4,000 USD. CP calculation: 4,000 USD ÷ 9,900 USD = 0.40. The Monolith HTP-1, as a 16-channel compatible Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and Auro-3D processor, provides equivalent basic functionality from a user perspective with room correction (Dirac Live), high-quality DAC, and digital signal processing capabilities. While Trinnov's proprietary room correction technology is added value, no decisive performance improvement justifying the price difference can be confirmed through measurements.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

It maintains an appropriate support system as a professional market product. Regular firmware updates (latest version 4.3.2) continue functional improvements, particularly enhancing measurement accuracy and external noise countermeasures. Reliability in commercial environments has been proven through adoption records in major movie theaters worldwide. However, detailed information about warranty periods and repair systems is limited, falling short of industry-leading evaluation. Given the highly specialized nature of the product, support often goes through certified dealers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As a dedicated processor for the professional cinema market, its design philosophy holds a certain rationality. In an environment requiring 24/7 continuous operation, dedicated hardware with guaranteed stability, independent of OS updates, and long-term support has a clear advantage over general-purpose PC-based solutions. Integration into industry-standard workflows is also considered. On the other hand, in an era where similar acoustic correction functions can be achieved with less expensive consumer-grade processors or software, the rationale for this high-priced dedicated hardware relies heavily on "reliability and stability" rather than pure sound quality performance, making it somewhat conservative from a technological innovation perspective.

## Advice

There is consideration value for professional cinema environments that prioritize integration with existing systems and seek comprehensive solutions including manufacturer support. The measured performance certainly achieves transparent levels, and no dissatisfaction will arise in terms of sound quality. However, for cost-conscious cases, we strongly recommend substitution with the Monolith HTP-1. It can realize equivalent basic functionality at 40% of the price, with practical sound quality differences below measurement limits. Regarding room correction functionality, it also comes standard with Dirac Live, making functional differences limited. For new installations, it is important to make comprehensive judgments including the possibility of future migration to software-based solutions.
