## Overview

The Trinnov Audio Nova is a 1U rack-mountable room and monitor optimization processor developed by Trinnov Audio, which has been researching room correction technology since 2003. Released in 2024, this product brings technologies refined in the company's high-end models to a more accessible price point. It features spatial measurement technology using proprietary 3D microphones and comprehensive optimization functions that correct not only frequency response but also phase, group delay, and impulse response. The system has been completely redesigned from the previous Linux-based architecture to ARM processors, packing advanced processing capabilities into a compact chassis.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Nova records exceptionally excellent measurement performance. The A/D and D/A dynamic range achieves 115dB (A-weighted, +18dBu reference), significantly exceeding the transparency level (105dB or higher). THD+N realizes over 110dB (1kHz, 0dBFS), meeting the transparency level of 0.01% or lower. The newly designed AD/DA section using ESS Sabre chipsets dramatically reduces distortion and noise across all frequency bands. The proprietary 3D microphone features four omnidirectional condenser capsules arranged in a tetrahedral configuration, with each unit individually calibrated. Sound on Sound magazine's review evaluated it as providing "clear performance improvement" and "significantly enhanced detail and accuracy," confirming objective sound quality improvement effects.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Trinnov has developed the industry's only individually calibrated 3D microphone system, establishing technology for precise three-dimensional measurement of speaker positions and angles within space. While typical room correction is limited to frequency response correction, the Nova comprehensively optimizes phase response, group delay, and impulse response. The complete transition to ARM processors achieves significant miniaturization and efficiency improvements from the previous Linux PC-based system. Dante network compatibility enables low-latency audio transmission at 250 microseconds, ensuring integration in professional environments. The design allowing software license expansion from 2 to 6 channels demonstrates technical flexibility. These technologies are proprietary developments continuously evolved from the company's initial products since 2005.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Trinnov Nova's 2-channel version is priced at 3,490 USD. A more functionally comparable alternative with multi-channel expandability is the "miniDSP Flex HTx" (approx. 950 USD), which features XLR balanced I/O. This product offers high-precision room correction via Dirac Live and provides 8 channels of balanced outputs, covering the professional connectivity and multi-channel capabilities of the Nova. Based on the review policy, the calculation "950 USD รท 3,490 USD = 0.272..." is rounded as required, resulting in a score of 0.3. Users can opt for a functionally very similar alternative at less than a quarter of the price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Trinnov has continuously researched and developed room correction technology since 2003, demonstrating over 20 years of expertise as a specialized company. The technical foundation initially developed for professional studios indicates high reliability. Software updates including hardware bypass functionality were provided in 2024, showing continuous product improvement. The 1U rack-mount design for professional use features robust construction suitable for long-term use. Support systems are established through a global dealer network. However, being a relatively niche product, there are slight concerns about parts procurement and support continuity compared to mass-produced products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Trinnov's design philosophy adopts an objective approach based on scientific measurement, which is extremely rational. The comprehensiveness of correcting phase, group delay, and impulse response in addition to frequency characteristics represents the acoustically correct direction. The strategy of bringing studio-proven technology to the consumer market is also reasonable. The transition to ARM processors for compactization and efficiency represents a modern approach. However, questions remain about the necessity of existence as dedicated hardware. Considering current computer processing capabilities and advances in software-based room correction technology, equivalent or better results can be achieved with PC-based solutions like Dirac Live or REW. The necessity of existing as dedicated equipment in this price range becomes somewhat weak, except for integration and reliability in professional applications.

## Advice

While the Trinnov Nova is a technically excellent product that shines in pro studios and high-end systems, it has significant cost-performance issues. For typical home audio use and many project studios, sufficient performance can be achieved with more affordable alternatives like the "miniDSP Flex HTx." The Flex HTx supports XLR balanced connections and multi-channel outputs, allowing for a functionally very similar setup at about a quarter of the price. The Nova is only recommended for those who place a strong value on Trinnov's unique 3D measurement and correction algorithms or require integration with an existing Trinnov ecosystem. It is wise to first consider a Dirac Live-equipped device like the miniDSP Flex HTx, and only if its correction quality is still found lacking, should a high-end machine like the Nova be considered.
