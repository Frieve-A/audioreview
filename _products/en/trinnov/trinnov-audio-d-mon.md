## Overview

The Trinnov Audio D-MON is a high-performance digital monitor controller developed by French acoustic technology company Trinnov. It features digital room correction functionality using the company's proprietary Optimizer technology, supporting systems from stereo to up to 18-channel immersive sound. Through comprehensive acoustic correction including phase correction using a 3D microphone system, it has been adopted by approximately 2,000 studios worldwide. It has established a solid position in the professional audio field, achieving complete integration with AVID control surfaces (S6, S5, S4, S3) and Icon D-Command/D-Control.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The D-MON's measured performance achieves excellent levels that exceed industry standards. According to published specifications, it achieves dynamic range of 119dB for A-D conversion and 118dB for D-A conversion (A-weighted), significantly exceeding the transparent level (105dB or higher) in the measurement results reference table. Frequency response is specified as 20Hz-20kHz (±0.1dB), meeting transparent level criteria. Particularly noteworthy is the phase correction functionality, which realizes time-domain correction in addition to frequency-domain correction, unlike conventional products that only provide frequency-domain correction. It supports sampling rates up to 96kHz, providing performance that meets mastering studio-level requirements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Trinnov's technical capabilities represent one of the industry's highest standards. The proprietary Optimizer technology employs an innovative approach using a 3D microphone system (four omni capsules in tetrahedral arrangement) to identify each speaker's position through triangulation while achieving phase correction. This represents a comprehensive solution that includes time-domain correction, while many room correction products in the market are limited to frequency-domain correction only. Advanced design specialized for professional use includes EUCON compatibility and complete integration with AVID control surfaces, GPIO/MIDI integration functionality. Channel configuration is also flexible, with expandability allowing software upgrades from 6 channels to 18 channels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The D-MON's price is extremely high, ranging from 15,500 to 27,500 USD depending on the configuration. Equivalent functionality can be achieved with more affordable alternatives. A comparable setup can be created for a total of approximately 999 USD by combining the multi-channel room correction software "Sonarworks SoundID Reference for Multichannel" (approx. 499 USD) with a multi-channel audio interface and monitor controller like the "Focusrite Scarlett 18i20" (approx. 500 USD). This combination provides comprehensive measurement-based room correction and professional monitor control. Calculating with a conservative D-MON price of 20,000 USD, the result is "999 USD ÷ 20,000 USD = 0.04995," which rounds to a rating of 0.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Trinnov, as a French company established in 2003, has a solid track record in the professional audio field. The adoption record of approximately 2,000 studios worldwide demonstrates high reliability. There is a track record of responding to feature expansion through firmware updates, and the hardware design flexibility results in product design that can withstand long-term use. However, current inventory shortages at major retailers (awaiting stock until July 2025) indicate supply-side challenges. While public information regarding warranty periods and specific RMA ratios is limited, the continued adoption status in professional applications suggests reliability above industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The D-MON's design philosophy adopts an extremely rational approach based on scientific evidence. Comprehensive room correction including phase correction provides acoustically more effective improvements than simple frequency response correction. Spatial acoustic analysis using a 3D microphone system contributes to measurement accuracy improvement and is more scientifically valid than conventional single-microphone measurement. The software-based channel expansion method is an efficient design that eliminates hardware waste. Practical functionality implementation focused on actual studio workflows, such as AVID integration and MIDI/GPIO support, is also rational. However, there are questions about the necessity of existing as dedicated hardware, and it somewhat lacks modern rationality in that equivalent functionality can be achieved at lower cost through software + general-purpose hardware.

## Advice

While the D-MON is a technically outstanding product, its extremely high price makes it unrecommendable for most users. Equivalent room correction and multi-channel monitor control functions can be achieved for less than one-twentieth of the cost by combining "Sonarworks SoundID Reference for Multichannel" (approx. 499 USD) and "Focusrite Scarlett 18i20" (approx. 500 USD). This alternative is a sufficiently practical choice even for professional studio environments. The D-MON's adoption is only justifiable in large-scale commercial studios where full integration with AVID control surfaces is mandatory, or in environments without any budget constraints. Owners of personal or small-scale studios should carefully evaluate the return on investment and prioritize more affordable alternatives.
