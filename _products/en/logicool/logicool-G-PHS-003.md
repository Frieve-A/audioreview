## Overview

The Logicool G-PHS-003 is a gaming headset released in 2019, developed in collaboration with professional esports players. It features 50mm Pro-G drivers with a hybrid mesh construction and Blue VO!CE technology for microphone audio processing. Weighing 320g (excluding the cable), it includes a 3.5mm analog connection and a USB external sound card, supporting a wide range of platforms including PS5, PS4, PC, and Switch. However, six years after its release, significant issues become apparent when evaluated from the perspective of current technological standards and price competitiveness.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The frequency response covers the standard range of 20Hz-20kHz, and the specification of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) under 0.1% is within an acceptable range, although slightly inferior to the high-end headphone standard (below 0.05% is excellent). The 35Ω impedance and 91.7dB SPL @ 1mW & 1cm sensitivity are appropriate, posing no issues for driving from most devices. The microphone's 100Hz-10kHz frequency response is suitable for voice communication. However, detailed measured data for crosstalk and dynamic range are not publicly available, and its validity remains at a moderate level compared to modern high-performance headsets.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Pro-G driver's hybrid mesh construction was advanced for 2019 but has since become common technology. While the real-time voice processing by Blue VO!CE technology is commendable, its technical advantage is limited compared to AI-based noise cancellation, which has become an industry standard. The 50mm driver size is also standard. Overall, the product combines technologies that were at the industry average for its time and now significantly lags behind current cutting-edge technological standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Against the current market price of 81 USD, there are products that offer equivalent or superior functionality at a lower price. For instance, the "SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1," with a market price of 51 USD, can utilize AI noise cancellation and advanced equalizer features comparable to this product's Blue VO!CE by combining it with the free PC software "Sonar." The price ratio against this alternative is `51 USD ÷ 81 USD = 0.62`, resulting in a score of 0.6. While this product's USB sound card has the advantage of retaining settings on consoles, it is difficult to justify a price difference of approximately 1.6 times.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Logicool is a globally established brand with a comprehensive support system in Japan. The G-PHS-003 is offered with a 2-year domestic warranty, and response to failures is relatively swift. Based on the company's past product track record, its physical durability is considered to be above the industry average. However, as it is an older product released in 2019, there are concerns about the continuity of future firmware and driver update support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Tuning through collaboration with professional esports players is a rational approach, but its effect on sound quality improvement is not clearly demonstrated with measured data. The inclusion of Blue VO!CE technology contributes to voice quality, but nowadays, equivalent or superior functions can be achieved with more affordable software. Minimizing latency with a 3.5mm analog connection is logical, but this advantage has diminished with advancements in USB-C and wireless technologies. From a 2025 perspective, the product's raison d'être is weakened by the abundance of cheaper and higher-performance alternatives.

## Advice

The purchase of the G-PHS-003 is not recommended. For its current price of 81 USD, the "SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1" (51 USD) combined with the free "Sonar" software is a more functional and less expensive option for PC users. If you insist on Logicool products, we strongly recommend considering newer models. If your budget allows, consider investing in technologically advanced and cost-effective products like the HyperX Cloud III or the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5. In the 2025 market environment, the G-PHS-003 is a disadvantageous choice in terms of price competitiveness.
