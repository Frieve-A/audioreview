## Overview

The CCZ CM01 is a compact USB-C to 3.5mm portable DAC and headphone amplifier featuring the popular CX31993 DAC chip paired with MAX97220 amplifier [1]. Released in September 2025, this 18.99 USD dongle targets users seeking Hi-Res audio capability from mobile devices and computers [1]. The unit supports PCM up to 384kHz/32bit and includes both USB-C and USB-A adapters for broad compatibility [2]. CCZ positions this as an affordable entry point into high-quality portable audio with premium cable construction featuring 4N pure copper conductors with silver plating and gold-plated connectors [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The CCZ CM01 demonstrates strong performance in available manufacturer specifications. Signal-to-noise ratio measures 124dB [3], significantly exceeding the transparent level threshold of 105dB and indicating excellent noise performance. Total harmonic distortion plus noise achieves -95dB (0.0003%) at 1kHz [3], substantially better than the transparent level of 0.01%, showing very low distortion characteristics. PCM sample rate support extends to 384kHz/32bit [3], exceeding standard audio requirements. Output power of 63mW at 32Ω [3] falls between problematic and transparent levels for driving common headphones and IEMs. However, comprehensive evaluation is limited by absence of frequency response, crosstalk, and dynamic range measurements from independent sources. Conservative adjustment applied due to reliance on manufacturer specifications rather than third-party verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The CM01 employs standard off-the-shelf components with the CX31993 DAC and MAX97220 amplifier combination widely adopted across the industry. This represents contemporary but not cutting-edge technology implementation. The chipset choice demonstrates appropriate technical selection as multiple manufacturers utilize this proven combination, indicating market acceptance and reliability. However, the design lacks proprietary innovations or technical differentiation, resulting in minimal competitive advantage duration as competing products can easily replicate the implementation. Construction follows conventional portable DAC design principles with appropriate digital circuit integration. The technology represents competent engineering execution within established industry standards rather than advancement of the state of art.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The CCZ CM01 costs 18.99 USD in current US market [1]. The JCally JM6 Pro at 14 USD provides equivalent-or-better functionality and performance [5]. Equipped with identical CX31993+MAX97220 chipset implementation, and equivalent measured performance including SNR 124dB, THD+N -95dB, and PCM 32bit/384kHz matching the CM01's specifications. CP = 14 USD ÷ 18.99 USD = 0.7. The JM6 Pro demonstrates superior cost-performance despite the CM01's premium cable construction and USB-A adapter inclusion, highlighting the price premium for these additional features over core audio functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

CCZ offers 12-18 month warranty coverage, below the industry standard two-year period. The company provides 24/7 customer support with commitment to 24-hour response times and replacement policy for reported issues. Simple dongle construction with minimal moving parts and solid-state components provides inherently robust design resistant to mechanical failure. However, CCZ represents a newer brand without established long-term reliability track record compared to established manufacturers. Support infrastructure appears adequate for the product category with direct manufacturer backing, though global service network extent remains unclear. Simple plug-and-play operation reduces potential software-related support requirements.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

CCZ demonstrates rational approach emphasizing measured performance over subjective audio mythology. The company utilizes established, proven chip combinations without unsubstantiated claims of audible improvements beyond measured specifications. Cost-effectiveness approach prioritizes efficient proven chipsets rather than expensive exotic components, resulting in competitive pricing for delivered functionality. Technology adoption focuses on contemporary digital chips used efficiently for function and cost reduction rather than pursuing analog nostalgia or vacuum tube implementations. The design philosophy actively reduces meaningless costs relative to function and measured performance. However, conservative approach using proven technology rather than innovative advancement limits technical progression. Company statements emphasize sound quality improvement through engineering rather than marketing mystique, aligning with scientific audio principles.

## Advice

For users seeking affordable Hi-Res audio capability from USB-C devices, the CCZ CM01 provides solid technical performance at competitive pricing. The proven CX31993+MAX97220 chipset delivers transparent audio quality for most listening scenarios [3]. Consider this product if premium cable construction and included USB-A adapter justify the price premium over alternatives like the Apple USB-C adapter or JCally JM6 Pro [5]. Users requiring maximum output power for high-impedance headphones should evaluate alternatives with higher-power amplifier stages. Those prioritizing absolute lowest cost should consider the Apple USB-C adapter. The CM01 represents sensible choice for users wanting reliable portable DAC functionality without exotic audio claims or excessive pricing.
