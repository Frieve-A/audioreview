## Overview

The CCZ MC04 Nocturne is a 28USD budget hybrid IEM (In-Ear Monitor) from Chinese audio brand CCZ. It features a combination of a 10mm composite diaphragm dynamic driver and custom balanced armature (1DD+1BA) configuration, delivering a warm V-shaped sound signature. The design incorporates a PC cavity with metallic faceplate and silver-plated OFC cable, targeting consumer gaming and music listening applications. CCZ positions itself as a relatively emerging audio brand, emphasizing sound tuning based on 20 years of engineering industry experience.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The CCZ MC04's measurement performance sits at standard levels for budget products. While the nominal specifications list a frequency range of 20Hz-20kHz, impedance of 16Ω±15%, and sensitivity of 105dB±3dB, detailed actual measurement data for THD, SNR, crosstalk, and other parameters are not publicly available. Review information indicates that despite the V-shaped tuning, sibilance is appropriately controlled in the 6kHz and 8kHz regions, and metallic timbre is avoided despite the BA driver implementation. However, achieving transparency levels (±0.5dB frequency response, <0.01% THD, >105dB SNR) appears unlikely, positioning the product between the problematic and transparent levels of the measurement criteria table.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 1DD+1BA hybrid design aims to combine dynamic driver bass expression with BA driver high-frequency extension. The adoption of a 10mm composite diaphragm and custom BA selection represents commendable technical investment considering the price point. However, the implementation essentially remains a combination of existing technologies with limited uniqueness or advancement. While standard high-quality components like silver-plated OFC cable and 2PIN-TFZ connection are employed, cost-cutting measures such as the PC cavity are also evident. From industry standards, this represents a standard technology level without notable innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

For the CCZ MC04 (28USD, approximately 4,131 JPY), the cheapest alternative with equivalent functionality and performance is the KZ ZSN Pro X (24USD, approximately 3,541 JPY). Both products are 1DD+1BA hybrid IEMs with similar frequency range, impedance, and sensitivity specifications, featuring removable 2PIN cables. The cost-performance calculation yields "3,541 JPY ÷ 4,131 JPY = 0.857," which rounds to a score of 0.9. In the budget hybrid IEM market, the CCZ MC04 commands a slight premium compared to competitors, but this difference remains limited to approximately 15%, maintaining good cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

CCZ is a relatively emerging audio brand with limited long-term reliability track record. The product includes a 12-month manufacturing defect warranty, with customer support claiming 24-hour response times. Official sales channels through KEEPHIFI and confirmed availability on Amazon and other platforms provide some assurance. However, limitations in company scale and history create concerns regarding warranty coverage, parts supply, and service continuity compared to major manufacturers. While the support structure is standard for an emerging brand, it falls below industry average evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The CCZ MC04's design philosophy adopts a rational approach for a budget hybrid IEM. The combination of dynamic driver natural bass expression with BA driver high-frequency extension represents a technically established methodology. The V-shaped tuning is appropriate for consumer applications, with sound quality optimizations including sibilance control and metallic timbre avoidance implemented. However, the necessity as a dedicated audio device is limited, as specifications allowing adequate performance with direct smartphone connection suggest potential substitution with general-purpose devices. While room remains for measurement data transparency improvements and more scientific approaches to sound quality enhancement, the design decisions are evaluated as realistic considering price constraints.

## Advice

The CCZ MC04 is a suitable choice for users wanting to experience hybrid driver configuration at the 28USD price point. The warm V-shaped sound suits music listening and gaming applications, with comfort assured for extended wear. However, for users seeking more precise sound quality, alternatives like the Moondrop Chu II (19USD) or 7Hz Zero (20USD), which offer higher measurement performance despite single-driver designs, are recommended. These products provide slight price advantages while potentially offering more transparent sound characteristics. When selecting the CCZ MC04, users should understand that they are trading the cohesiveness that single-driver products provide for the complexity of hybrid configuration. Given the emerging brand status, careful initial defect checking within the warranty period is essential.
