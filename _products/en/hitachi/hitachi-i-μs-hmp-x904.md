## Overview

The Hitachi i-μ's HMP-X904 is a discontinued digital audio player released in April 2009, featuring 4GB internal storage and basic MP3/WMA playback capabilities. This compact device weighs 30g and includes standard features of its era such as voice recording, built-in equalizer, and direct USB connectivity. While representing adequate technology for 2009 consumer electronics standards, the product has been completely discontinued with no manufacturer support available since Hitachi ceased consumer electronics operations in North America in 2020.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The HMP-X904's measured performance places it at the problematic threshold according to scientific audio criteria. Available manufacturer specifications include signal-to-noise ratio of 80dB and frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz. The S/N ratio of 80dB falls exactly at the borderline where audio quality becomes problematic (80dB or below problematic, 105dB or above transparent). The frequency response covers the full audible spectrum but lacks deviation specifications (±dB) critical for transparency assessment. Comprehensive distortion measurements including THD (Total Harmonic Distortion), IMD (Intermodulation Distortion), crosstalk, and dynamic range are not available from manufacturer specifications or independent third-party sources. Without these critical performance indicators, complete scientific evaluation is limited. The available S/N ratio at the problematic threshold and lack of comprehensive measurement data places this product significantly below transparent audio performance levels achieved by current digital audio players with documented performance specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The HMP-X904 represents outdated 2009-era portable music player technology without proprietary innovations or advanced digital signal processing. The product utilizes standard lithium polymer battery technology and basic USB connectivity, lacking technical differentiation from contemporary competitors. The implementation reflects conventional consumer electronics design without advanced integration of digital processing, wireless connectivity, or high-resolution audio capabilities. No proprietary patent technology, innovative design approaches, or technical sophistication distinguishes this product from basic consumer electronics of its era. Current digital audio player technology has advanced significantly beyond this product's technical capabilities.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The HMP-X904 is listed at ¥817 (approximately 5.50 USD) on the Tsukumo official retail site, though currently marked as out of stock [3]. At this official pricing, the HMP-X904 represents the world's cheapest digital audio player with its specific functionality and performance characteristics. Modern budget alternatives such as the SanDisk Clip Jam cost significantly more at approximately 42 USD [1], offering equivalent-or-better performance with 8GB internal storage, expandable microSD storage, 18-hour battery life versus the HMP-X904's 14 hours, and broader format support including MP3, WMA, AAC, and Audible. While the Clip Jam provides superior functionality in most areas, its substantially higher price point means no cheaper equivalent-or-better product exists at the HMP-X904's official retail price level. The HMP-X904's cost-performance score reflects its position as the lowest-priced product in its category, despite limited availability through official retail channels due to discontinued status.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The HMP-X904 suffers from complete obsolescence in support infrastructure. Hitachi permanently ceased consumer product sales and distribution in North America in 2020, with warranty periods long expired for all units manufactured in 2009. No manufacturer support, parts availability, or repair services exist for this product. While the device's simple construction with minimal moving parts suggests inherent reliability during operation, the complete absence of manufacturer warranty coverage, technical support, or replacement parts significantly impacts long-term reliability prospects. Local independent repair facilities may provide limited service, but parts availability depends entirely on distributor remaining stock with no guarantee of availability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The HMP-X904's design philosophy reflects conventional 2009 consumer electronics approaches without evidence of measurement-focused audio development or innovative design rationality. The product lacks advanced functional integration, scientific audio optimization, or cost-effective technology adoption that characterizes rational modern audio equipment design. No measurement-based development approach or cutting-edge technology adoption is evident in the product's implementation. The design philosophy has been completely superseded by more rational approaches: current budget digital audio players achieve superior measured performance through mass production efficiency, advanced digital signal processing, and integration of contemporary technologies like wireless connectivity and high-resolution audio support. The product represents conservative consumer electronics design lacking innovation or scientific approach to audio quality improvement.

## Advice

The Hitachi i-μ's HMP-X904 cannot be recommended for any practical audio application in 2025, despite its low official retail price of approximately 5.50 USD. While theoretically the cheapest option in its category, the product is currently unavailable through official retail channels (out of stock at Tsukumo) and offers severely limited functionality compared to modern alternatives. Potential purchasers seeking portable music playback should consider current alternatives like the SanDisk Clip Jam (approximately 42 USD) which provides vastly superior battery life, expandable storage, broader format support, and ongoing manufacturer support, despite the higher cost. For collectors interested in 2009-era consumer electronics history, this product represents standard technology of its era, but the combination of discontinued status, absence of manufacturer support, and severely limited functionality makes it unsuitable for users requiring reliable daily operation or technical assistance.
