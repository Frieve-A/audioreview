summary: "A floor-standing speaker carrying forward British dual concentric technology tradition. Features 93dB/W high efficiency and 1.3kHz crossover for musical coherence, but at USD 8,880 the price presents significant cost-performance challenges when equivalent performance is available at 1/3 the cost."

## Overview

The Tannoy Turnberry GR is a floor-standing speaker employing traditional British dual concentric technology. Featuring a 10-inch dual concentric driver with 93dB/W high efficiency, it achieves adequate volume levels with low-power amplifiers. The design emphasizes musical coherence through 34Hz to 44kHz frequency response and 1.3kHz crossover. The cabinet uses premium American walnut veneer/solid wood measuring 456×950×336mm, weighing 30kg, selling for USD 8,880 USD (¥1,298,000 per pair).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 93dB/W high efficiency represents objectively measurable performance providing practical benefits with low-power amplification. Dual concentric design offers theoretical advantages in phase coherence and time alignment through point-source characteristics. The 34Hz to 44kHz frequency response adequately covers the audible spectrum, with the 1.3kHz crossover frequency appropriately positioned for human auditory characteristics. The DPS (Distributed Port System) bass enhancement represents acoustically valid engineering. However, specific THD+N and SNR measurement data are not publicly available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Dual concentric technology represents Tannoy's refined proprietary approach developed over decades, demonstrating high technical competence. The combination of 10-inch driver and hard-edge Kurt Mueller woofer cone shows appropriate design judgment. Network circuitry completely redesigned based on flagship model development achieves improved phase characteristics and frequency response. Premium component crossover with deep cryogenic treatment for conductor crystal structure improvement shows technical consideration. The DPS system for bass handling represents innovative approach.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At USD 8,880, equivalent acoustic performance is available at substantially lower prices. The Klipsch Heresy IV (~USD 2,998/pair) offers equivalent 93dB SPL efficiency with completely redesigned hi-fi network and rear-port design achieving bass extension. The Klipsch Cornwall IV (~USD 6,598/pair) provides larger design with equivalent high-efficiency performance. The B&W 703 S3 (~USD 6,360/pair) offers 90dB SPL with excellent performance. CP = USD 2,998 ÷ USD 8,880 = 0.34, indicating approximately 3x price differential for comparable practical acoustic performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Tannoy is an established British speaker manufacturer with 90+ years of industry credibility. Domestic support infrastructure through authorized dealers maintains industry-standard warranty and service levels. Traditional craftsmanship assembly processes offer build quality consistency advantages, though may create constraints in parts availability and repair response compared to mass-production alternatives.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Dual concentric point-source design represents acoustically rational engineering principles with measurable advantages in phase coherence and time alignment. The 93dB/W high efficiency design provides significant practical value for low-power amplification, remaining relevant despite modern amplifier technology advances. Premium walnut finishes, while contributing to cost, represent legitimate quality construction appropriate for the premium market segment. The acoustic benefits of dual concentric technology are scientifically valid and measurable. While the 30kg weight creates installation constraints, this is balanced by the acoustic performance achieved through proper driver integration and cabinet construction. The design philosophy appropriately balances acoustic engineering principles with traditional British speaker craftsmanship standards.

## Advice

The Tannoy Turnberry GR appeals to users valuing British traditional audio culture and dual concentric technology, but is not recommended for pure acoustic performance seekers. An USD 8,880 budget would allow purchasing Klipsch Heresy IV (USD 2,998) or equivalent high-efficiency speakers with additional subwoofer and room acoustic treatment, creating superior acoustic systems. Remaining funds could support quality source equipment or amplification, enhancing overall acoustic experience. Consider only if you value British traditional craftsmanship heritage and find worth in non-acoustic elements.
