## Overview

The Tannoy Reveal 802 is an 8-inch bi-amplified studio monitor featuring a conventional 2-way design with 100 watts of total power (75W woofer, 25W tweeter). Positioned as the flagship model in Tannoy's Reveal series, it targets the mid-tier studio monitoring market with a frequency response of 42Hz-43kHz and maximum SPL of 114dB. The monitor incorporates multiple input options including balanced XLR, unbalanced 1/4", and auxiliary 1/8" connections, along with basic high-frequency adjustment controls.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Tannoy Reveal 802 lacks sufficient measurement data for proper evaluation. While manufacturer specifications indicate THD <0.4%, which falls between the problematic level (1% for speakers) and excellent level (0.1%), no credible third-party measurements are available to verify these claims. The frequency response is listed as 42Hz-43kHz without deviation tolerances, making it impossible to assess performance against the ±3dB standard or ±1dB excellent criteria. Without credible third-party measurements and lacking detailed audio-quality-relevant information beyond basic THD specifications, Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated and is set to 0.5 as per framework guidelines for insufficient data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Reveal 802 employs conventional bi-amplified 2-way design with standard Class A/B amplification, representing mature, well-understood approaches without innovation or technical sophistication. The monitor uses a standard soft dome tweeter and ported woofer configuration with basic EQ controls (+/-1.5dB HF adjustment). No advanced DSP, room correction, or digital processing is incorporated. The technology offers no significant technical differentiation from competitors, using established design patterns that are easily replicable without proprietary innovations or patents.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Current market price (pair): 550 USD. Comparison target: PreSonus Eris E8 XT (pair) at 498 USD [1]. Equipped with 8-inch woofer and bi-amplification, the PreSonus offers equivalent-or-better amplification (140W vs 100W) and more comprehensive EQ controls including low-cut, mid, and high controls plus acoustic space tuning compared to basic HF adjustment. CP = 498 USD ÷ 550 USD = 0.905 → 0.9. A cheaper alternative with superior functionality exists in the same product category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The support infrastructure appears significantly compromised with migration to online-only submission forms and customer reports of poor response times exceeding 6 weeks. Standard warranty terms are provided (2-3 years with registration), but repair infrastructure information is limited and customer experience reports indicate significant service deficiencies compared to competitors. The support system shows substantial deterioration from previous standards, creating reliability concerns for professional users requiring responsive technical assistance.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy follows conventional bi-amplified 2-way design with proven effectiveness. Materials and construction costs appear justified for the performance level, with no occult audio claims or unscientific marketing. The conservative approach prioritizes reliability over innovation, incorporating practical acoustic considerations such as front-firing port design for flexible placement. However, the design lacks advancement in state-of-the-art techniques or modern digital enhancements that could improve performance or user experience, representing rational but unambitious engineering.

## Advice

The Tannoy Reveal 802 is suitable for users seeking a conventional studio monitor with adequate specifications at mid-tier pricing. However, potential buyers should consider the PreSonus Eris E8 XT, which offers superior amplification (140W vs 100W) and more comprehensive EQ controls at a comparable price point of 249 USD. The significant support infrastructure deficiencies make this monitor less suitable for professional environments requiring reliable technical assistance. For home studios with limited support needs, the monitor provides acceptable performance, but the lack of innovation and measurement verification limits its appeal compared to more advanced alternatives.
