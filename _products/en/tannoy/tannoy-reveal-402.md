## Overview

The Tannoy Reveal 402 is a 4-inch active studio monitor designed for near-field monitoring applications in compact spaces. Measuring 240 x 147 x 212mm, it features a bi-amped design with 50 watts total power (25W per driver) driving a 4-inch plastic woofer and 0.75-inch soft dome tweeter. The monitor includes front-firing bass port design, multiple connectivity options (XLR, TRS, RCA, AUX), and basic HF trim controls. While Tannoy has established reputation with innovative Dual Concentric driver technology, the Reveal 402 employs conventional driver configuration without the company's proprietary innovations.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Reveal 402 lacks comprehensive measurement data necessary for proper scientific evaluation. Available manufacturer specifications show frequency response of 56Hz-48kHz without deviation tolerance specified, making comparison against ±3dB criteria impossible. The specified THD of <0.9% is near the problematic threshold for speakers (generally 1% or above) and well above excellent levels (around 0.1% or below). Critical audio quality metrics including S/N ratio, dynamic range, and IMD remain unspecified. Conservative evaluation applied due to manufacturer-only specifications without third-party verification [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Reveal 402 employs conventional bi-amped design without in-house innovation or cutting-edge features. While Tannoy is renowned for Dual Concentric driver technology developed in 1947, this entry-level model does not incorporate the company's proprietary innovations. Contemporary competitors demonstrate more advanced implementations including ADAM Audio's X-ART ribbon tweeters, KRK's room correction systems, and Neumann's DSP integration. The design utilizes standard analog circuitry without DSP, room correction, or digital features, representing basic technology integration without significant competitive advantage or technical differentiation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

At 250 USD per pair, the Tannoy Reveal 402 is a competitively priced 4-inch active studio monitor. As an equal-or-better comparator in user-facing functions, the PreSonus Eris E4.5 provides balanced 1/4-inch TRS and RCA rear inputs plus a front 1/8-inch aux, onboard 50 W Class AB power, and tuning controls, which are functionally equivalent for users compared to XLR/TRS on the Reveal 402. Using current official pricing:

CP = 157.99 USD ÷ 250 USD = 0.63 → rounds to 0.6.

Accordingly, Cost-Performance is set to 0.6. If better third-party measurement data changes the equivalence assessment, this value will be revised [2][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Reveal 402 offers 1-year standard warranty extendable to 3 years with registration, supported by global manufacturer infrastructure through Music Tribe Community Website support system. However, some user reports indicate potential amplifier noise issues in certain units, requiring individual verification before purchase. While simple analog construction theoretically benefits reliability, the extendable warranty period suggests manufacturer confidence in long-term durability. Standard support infrastructure provides adequate coverage for professional monitoring applications [3].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design philosophy represents conventional approach focused on cost-effective near-field monitoring without unnecessary feature complexity. While lacking modern DSP integration or proprietary innovations from Tannoy's premium lines, the straightforward bi-amped analog design prioritizes reliability and functional basics over technological advancement. The approach demonstrates rational cost allocation toward essential monitoring functions (amplification, connectivity, driver quality) rather than premium features, though this conservative strategy limits measurement performance advancement and scientific optimization opportunities available through modern digital processing technologies.

## Advice

For budget-conscious users seeking 4-inch near-field monitoring, the Reveal 402 represents reasonable value among equivalently-sized options despite lacking comprehensive measured performance data. Exercise caution regarding potential amplifier noise issues and verify individual unit performance before purchase. Users prioritizing proven measurement data should consider alternatives with third-party verification available. If specifically requiring Tannoy products, investigate higher-tier models incorporating the company's Dual Concentric technology for genuine technical advantages and superior measured performance.
