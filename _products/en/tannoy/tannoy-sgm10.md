## Overview

The Tannoy SGM10 is a 10-inch passive speaker that inherits the lineage of the company's legendary studio monitor "Super Gold." Through Dual Concentric (coaxial) driver technology, it achieves point source imaging and phase coherence, with a history of use in recording by many renowned artists since the 1970s. It features a 40Hz-30kHz frequency response, 89dB sensitivity, 8-ohm impedance, and is recommended for driving with 20-200W amplifiers. The cabinet uses high-density construction with DMT (Different Material Technology) and has a robust design weighing 18.5kg.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The SGM10's measured specifications include a 40Hz-30kHz (±3dB) frequency response, 89dB sensitivity, and maximum output of 116dB SPL. For speakers in general, a frequency response of ±3dB is considered a standard level of performance, and a sensitivity of 89dB is within an appropriate range. However, specific THD measurement values are not published, making it difficult to compare with modern transparency standards, such as speakers achieving THD below 0.1%. While the Dual Concentric design theoretically offers improved phase coherence, detailed data on actual crosstalk performance and S/N ratio is lacking. The passive design avoids electronic circuit-derived noise, but without built-in amplifier optimization and dependence on external amplifier combinations, guaranteeing measurement performance across the entire system becomes challenging.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Dual Concentric technology is Tannoy's core technology continuing since 1947, achieving acoustic radiation from a single point source through the coaxial arrangement of a 10-inch paper pulp cone and a 33mm aluminum/magnesium alloy dome tweeter. The 2nd-order low-pass and 1st-order high-pass crossover design at 1.2kHz is rational. The high-density cabinet construction using DMT technology and particleboard/MDF laminated panels contributes to vibration control. However, compared to cutting-edge modern technology, the magnetic circuit optimization and driver material technology cannot be considered industry-leading. This can be evaluated as a technology level that reproduces traditional design approaches with modern manufacturing techniques.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The SGM10's price in Japan is 550,000 JPY per unit (1,100,000 JPY per pair). As an alternative product with equivalent 10-inch driver low-frequency reproduction capability, the KRK Rokit RP10-3 G4 (118,800 JPY per pair) represents the most affordable option. Higher-performance 10-inch active monitors include the Genelec 1032C (approximately 740,000 JPY per pair) and Focal Trio11 Be (approximately 1,260,000 JPY per pair). Comparing with the most affordable equivalent product, KRK RP10-3 G4: 118,800 JPY ÷ 1,100,000 JPY = 0.108, which rounds to a score of 0.1. Despite equivalent physical low-frequency reproduction capability from the 10-inch driver, considering the active design's built-in amplifier optimization, DSP functionality, and convenience, the price premium for the passive design is excessive.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Tannoy is an established audio manufacturer founded in 1926 with extensive achievements in professional fields. Quality control is good through UK design and manufacturing, and as passive speakers, the risk of electronic component failure is low, with high long-term reliability. The domestic support structure through authorized distributors in Japan is well-established, with repair and maintenance services available. However, compared to innovative products from emerging manufacturers, modern support elements like firmware updates are absent. Reliability as passive speakers is at the upper levels of the industry.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The SGM10's design philosophy is scientifically rational. Acoustic radiation from a single point source through Dual Concentric technology offers theoretical advantages in phase coherence and directivity control. The passive design approach that avoids electronic circuit-derived noise and distortion while optimizing through external amplifier combinations is rational. The direction toward a flat frequency response as studio monitors is appropriate, and the energy control system's adjustment functionality is practical. The approach of recreating 1970s masterpieces with modern manufacturing techniques can be evaluated as an effort toward measurement performance improvement. Occult elements are eliminated, maintaining a design philosophy based on acoustic engineering.

## Advice

While the SGM10 has technical value as a product reviving traditional studio monitor design for modern times, significant cost-performance challenges make a general purchase recommendation difficult. With a budget of 1,100,000 JPY, achieving basic 10-inch monitoring with a KRK RP10-3 G4 pair (118,800 JPY) and enhancing the remaining budget with room correction systems and amplification would be more rational. Higher-performance alternatives include the Genelec 1032C pair (approximately 740,000 JPY), Focal Trio11 Be pair (approximately 1,260,000 JPY), and Neumann KH420 pair (approximately 1,580,000 JPY), all providing superior measurement performance and modern functionality compared to the SGM10. Rational reasons to choose the SGM10 are limited to a special dedication to Dual Concentric technology or the desire to optimize external amplifier combinations through its passive design. Even for professional use, modern active monitors are superior in measurement performance, convenience, and expandability.
