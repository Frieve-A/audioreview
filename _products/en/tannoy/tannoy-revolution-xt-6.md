## Overview

The Tannoy Revolution XT 6 is a standmount bookshelf speaker using the company’s dual concentric driver: a 6-inch multifiber cone woofer with a coaxially mounted 1-inch PEI dome tweeter in a Torus-Ogive waveguide. It crosses at 1.8kHz, is specified at 8Ω nominal and 89dB sensitivity, and targets the competitive 1000 USD/pair segment (dark walnut/medium oak; black/white 1050 USD) [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Third-party measurements show mixed performance with a major transparency issue centered in the presence region. Stereophile measured on-axis output with a **significant 2–3kHz peak** and noted the **tweeter is 3–5dB too high in level**; critically, that 2–3kHz peak **continues out to 90° off-axis**, so EQ at one seat won’t fully fix the tonal balance across a room [1]. Positives include **measured sensitivity of 88.8dB/2.83V/m** and a benign impedance profile with a **5Ω minimum between 185–230Hz**; the **port tuning is ~50Hz** (woofer minimum-motion notch), and the reflex alignment appears maximally flat [1]. Net: other basics are acceptable, but the broad presence lift keeps the score low.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The dual concentric driver aims at point-source behavior and good vertical integration, and the Torus-Ogive waveguide evidences real engineering. The concentric implementation and cabinet execution are competent but evolutionary rather than groundbreaking. Classical 2nd-order LF / 1st-order HF at 1.8kHz is conventional, and the measured frequency-response issues suggest incomplete system optimization rather than limitations of the concept itself [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (user functions & measured performance): Polk Audio Reserve R200, 749 USD/pair (Crutchfield).** It offers equivalent user-facing functionality (passive 2-way bookshelf) with **flat on-axis response and controlled directivity** in independent CTA-2034 testing, i.e., equal-or-better measured fidelity than the XT 6 [3].  
**CP calculation:** CP = min(1.0, 749 USD / 1000 USD) = 0.749 → 0.7 (rounded to one decimal). Price sources verified [2][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Tannoy provides a typical warranty and has long-standing distribution. Build appears robust, and as a passive design there is no firmware risk. Specific field failure-rate data is not public for this model; documentation depth and measurement transparency lag some competitors.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Pursuing point-source behavior via a concentric topology is rational. However, failing to control the 2–3kHz region (and elevated tweeter level) indicates the development process did not fully close the loop between design aims and system-level measurements [1].

## Advice

If you want neutral, measurement-first performance around this price, **Polk Reserve R200 (749 USD)** is the value pick [3][4]. If you specifically want a concentric design at higher fidelity, **KEF LS50 Meta (1,599.99 USD)** is the better-executed coaxial, albeit at a higher price [7]. If you want a three-way concentric on a budget, **ELAC Uni-Fi 2.0 UB52 (799 USD)** measures well for the money [5][6]. Given the XT 6’s persistent presence-region excess, it is not recommended for accuracy-focused listening.
