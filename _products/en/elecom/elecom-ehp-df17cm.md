## Overview

The ELECOM EHP-DF17CM is a wired earphone with a USB-C connection and active noise cancelling functionality. It features a 10mm dynamic driver, a built-in DAC with hi-res audio support, and an AI DNN microphone for calls. It allows direct connection to USB-C devices like the iPhone 15 series. The lightweight design weighs 7.8g (excluding cable) and includes four sizes of ear tips. ELECOM, founded in 1986, is an established Japanese PC accessory manufacturer with a broad range of peripheral devices and a certain track record in the audio field.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Published measurement data is limited, and no detailed third-party measurements exist, making it difficult to objectively assess if its performance reaches a transparent level. The 20Hz-20kHz frequency response and 16ฮฉ impedance are standard, but key metrics like THD and SNR are unknown. The ANC performance also lacks quantitative data on the level of attenuation (dB). As a wired connection, the absence of audio latency, inherent in Bluetooth, is a clear advantage for timing-critical applications like gaming and video editing. However, due to the lack of core data demonstrating audio fidelity, the evaluation must be limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AI DNN (Deep Neural Network) noise-reduction microphone included in this product is a modern and advanced audio processing technology. While it doesn't improve music playback fidelity, it enhances call quality, which is an important function of the product and relevant for the Technology Level assessment. Although there is no information on the uniqueness of the specific algorithm, the integration of an advanced AI technology into the product's functionality is commendable and goes beyond a mere combination of existing components. Therefore, the technology level is judged to be slightly above the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Products that combine a USB-C connection and active noise cancelling functionality for around 27 USD are rare. However, alternatives are not nonexistent. For example, Samsung's "Type-C Earphones Sound by AKG (EO-IC500)" also features a USB-C connection and ANC, and is available for about 23 USD. Using this as the cheapest alternative, the cost-performance can be calculated. The calculation: 23 USD รท 27 USD = 0.875, which results in a score of 0.9. This is a very competitive price point within this niche category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

ELECOM, founded in 1986, has a long history as a Japanese company with an established domestic support system. However, long-term reliability data for its audio products is limited. Specific figures such as warranty period, failure rates (RMA ratio), and MTBF are not disclosed, making objective evaluation difficult. While the company has a track record as a PC accessory manufacturer, its expertise compared to specialized audio manufacturers is partially unknown. This product has low firmware update requirements, but future support continuity is also unclear, meaning it does not have an industry-leading reliability and support system.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product concept of combining a USB-C connection with ANC is a rational approach to accommodate modern devices that have eliminated the headphone jack. In particular, the combination of zero-latency from a wired connection and ANC provides a distinct value for specific users (e.g., rhythm gamers, video editors) that wireless products cannot replace, which is a rational design choice in that respect. However, with the market trend shifting towards more convenient true wireless earphones, the limitation of being wired is a significant drawback. The strategy of prioritizing a niche feature combination over ensuring measurement transparency and scientifically pursuing sound quality is a point of contention.

## Advice

The EHP-DF17CM is a product that caters to a very specific need. It is recommended for users with a USB-C device who require zero audio latency for applications like gaming or video editing and also want to reduce ambient noise. If these conditions are met, it offers a unique value that wireless products lack. For general music listening, true wireless ANC earphones in the same price range are superior in convenience. If ANC is not necessary, cheaper wired USB-C earphones exist. If sound quality is the top priority, other options should be considered; if convenience is key, look into wireless products. However, for users for whom "USB-C, Wired, ANC, and Low-Latency" are all mandatory, this is one of the few valuable options available.
