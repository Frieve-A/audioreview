summary: "A 5.5-inch nearfield monitor featuring X-ART tweeter technology, but suffers from clear frequency response issues at 1.1kHz due to front-port design and limited support due to discontinuation."

## Overview

The ADAM Audio A5X is a 2-way active nearfield monitor combining the company's distinctive X-ART folded ribbon tweeter with a 5.5-inch woofer. It features 50W amplifiers for both tweeter and woofer, achieving a maximum output of 110dB SPL. The driver utilizes carbon fiber/rohacell/glass fiber composite materials to improve dynamic characteristics. However, it is now a discontinued product, making new purchases difficult.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

According to detailed measurements from AudioScienceReview, the A5X shows a clear frequency response dip at 1.1kHz. This is caused by the cancellation effect from the front-port design, a problem also observed in other front-ported 2-way speakers like the JBL 7 series. Distortion at 86dB SPL is well controlled, with appropriate band limiting through high-pass filtering. While overall characteristics are good, the clear issue at 1.1kHz prevents it from achieving transparent performance levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The X-ART folded ribbon tweeter is advanced technology that achieves lower distortion and ultra-high frequency reproduction up to 50kHz compared to conventional dome tweeters. The carbon fiber composite driver cone suppresses resonance and provides excellent dynamic characteristics. The Class A/B amplifier design for the drive circuit is also appropriate. However, measurement results reveal that the front-port design suffered from insufficient computer modeling and material/texture optimization, indicating issues with design completeness.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The A5X currently costs 1419.98USD (per pair), while the JBL 305P MkII with equivalent or superior performance is available for around 318USD (per pair). The JBL 305P MkII is in the same 5-inch class, offering superior midrange clarity and more linear bass characteristics than the A5X. The calculation is: 318USD รท 1419.98USD = 0.223, which rounds to 0.2. While the A5X's X-ART tweeter has an advantage in high-frequency characteristics, the performance difference does not justify the significant price gap.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

ADAM Audio is an established German manufacturer, but the A5X is already discontinued and listed as an "Archived Product" on the official website. Major retailers have ceased selling it, making it very difficult to acquire new. With manufacturing discontinued, future parts supply and support cannot be expected, leaving new purchasers with extremely limited options. While initial product quality was good, the lack of ongoing support due to discontinuation results in a low rating for reliability and support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

X-ART tweeter technology is a scientifically rational approach that contributes to sound quality improvement. However, the cancellation effect at 1.1kHz from the front-port design is a problem that could have been predicted and avoided during the design stage, raising questions about its rationality. Considering that other models from the same company and competing products avoid similar issues with rear-port designs, this design choice appears irrational. While the modern approach of emphasizing measurement results is commendable, the response to defects revealed by actual measurements was insufficient.

## Advice

The A5X is an attractive monitor with excellent X-ART tweeter technology, but we do not recommend new purchases as it is a discontinued product. Realistic alternatives include the JBL 305P MkII (around 318USD per pair), which offers equivalent or superior performance at a lower price, or the similarly well-regarded Yamaha HS5 (around 400USD per pair). For those who already own the A5X, continued use is possible with an understanding of the 1.1kHz issue, but there are long-term support concerns. We strongly recommend new purchasers select from currently available products.
