## Overview

The Adam Audio A3X is a 4.5-inch active studio monitor developed by German company Adam Audio. It features the company's distinctive X-ART ribbon tweeter and employs a bi-amped configuration with 25W×2 in a compact enclosure. Combined with a carbon fiber woofer, it achieves a frequency response of 60Hz-50kHz (-10dB). With its lightweight design of 4.6kg, it was positioned as a product specialized for desktop nearfield monitoring applications, but is currently discontinued.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Measurement performance shows areas that require improvement. THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) is 0.8% or less at 90dB/1m above 100Hz, which is close to the problematic threshold of 1% for speakers. Maximum sound pressure level remains at a moderate 98dB/1m for single, 106dB/1m for pair. While the frequency response spans 60Hz-50kHz (-10dB) with a wide range, the low-frequency extension only reaches 60Hz, which is insufficient for nearfield monitors. Due to physical constraints of the 4.5-inch driver, full-range monitoring has limitations, and the design philosophy assumes combination with a subwoofer.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The X-ART ribbon tweeter is the company's proprietary technology, achieving higher sound pressure levels and lower distortion compared to conventional dome tweeters through rational design. The carbon fiber woofer is also a technically sound choice that balances lightness and high rigidity. The bi-amped configuration with individually optimized 25W amplifiers for each driver is technically valid. The crossover frequency setting of 2800Hz is also an appropriate value considering the characteristics of the drivers used. However, overall it remains within the scope of combining existing technologies, with no revolutionary technological breakthroughs observed.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

As a discontinued product, it is currently traded in the used market, with an average auction price of 187 USD on Yahoo Auctions. Current alternatives with equivalent functionality include the successor Adam Audio T5V at 288 USD per pair and KRK Rokit 5 G4 at 470 USD per pair. Compared to the cheapest alternative T5V: 288 USD ÷ 187 USD = 1.54, making the A3X effectively the most affordable option. Compared to KRK: 470 USD ÷ 187 USD = 2.51, with A3X being significantly cheaper. Despite the constraint of being discontinued, it demonstrates superiority in pure price-to-performance ratio over current products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Adam Audio has a certain level of reliability as an established German audio manufacturer, but the A3X is already discontinued, raising concerns about future firmware updates and spare parts supply. The failure rate of the company's other products is considered to be at industry average levels, but due to the characteristics of being a discontinued product, long-term support systems have limitations. For used purchases, quality variations due to individual differences must also be considered. Compared to current products, it is clearly disadvantaged in terms of support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The active design and bi-amped configuration are rational approaches that maximize the characteristics of each driver. The adoption of X-ART tweeters is also a scientifically valid choice that contributes to improved high-frequency transparency. However, physical constraints due to the 4.5-inch driver are unavoidable, with limitations in full-range monitoring. Currently, many products in the same price range feature larger drivers and achieve superior measurement performance, so the design philosophy feels constrained by the era. While there is certain rationality as a specialized design emphasizing compactness, there is significant room for improvement from the perspective of overall sound quality achievement.

## Advice

The Adam Audio A3X is a discontinued product, making new purchases currently difficult. While it trades at relatively affordable prices in the used market, we strongly recommend comparing it with current alternatives. Particularly, the successor T5V achieves superior measurement performance and low-frequency extension in the same price range, with new product warranty included. If there are reasons to consider the A3X, it would be limited to auxiliary monitoring applications on desktops. For main studio monitors, choosing current products with larger drivers will enable construction of more transparent and accurate monitoring environments. Even when emphasizing compactness, current products with superior measurement performance such as KRK Rokit 5 G4 and Yamaha HS5 are available in the same price range.
