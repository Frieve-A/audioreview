## Overview

The ADAM Audio T5V is a 2-way active nearfield monitor featuring the company’s U-ART accelerated ribbon tweeter in an HPS waveguide and a 5-inch polypropylene woofer. It uses Class-D bi-amplification (50 W LF / 20 W HF) with DSP-controlled crossover/EQ, specifies 45 Hz–25 kHz (-6 dB) bandwidth, and a **maximum 106 dB SPL per pair at 1 m** [2]. The T-Series approach focuses on pragmatic DSP crossover and controlled directivity in a compact, affordable package [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent Klippel NFS measurements show useful extension with about **51.3 Hz (-6 dB)** and **58.6 Hz (-3 dB)**. Midband deviation over **300 Hz–5 kHz is ~2.0 dB**, with a broadly neutral listening window; Preference Score is **4.06** (would be **6.42** with an ideal sub) [1]. While this is solid for the size/price, it does not keep a ±3 dB window across the full band, so we score the result as average. Manufacturer specs for bandwidth and maximum SPL align with the measurements [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The U-ART ribbon tweeter with HPS waveguide, Class-D bi-amp (50 W + 20 W), and a **DSP-controlled crossover** are well-executed technologies at this price [2][3]. The design aims at measurable benefits—directivity control and workable listening window—rather than cosmetic complexity.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current US market price for the T5V **pair** is **479.98 USD** [4]. A key equal-or-better measured alternative is **Kali Audio LP-6 V2**, which shows flatter listening-window response and deeper bass by third-party data [5]; its current US price for a **pair** is **498.00 USD** [6]. Therefore, **no cheaper equal-or-better option exists at review time**, and the T5V earns **CP = 1.0** (equivalence note: both are self-powered 2-way studio monitors; LP-6 V2’s measured FR/depth are equal-or-better) [5][6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

ADAM Audio maintains a global dealer/service network. The T5V carries up to a **5-year warranty** (2 years standard + 3-year extension upon registration) [2][3]. As this category doesn’t require user firmware updates, reliability hinges on hardware quality control, which is appropriate for professional use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Focusing on controlled directivity (HPS waveguide) and DSP crossover to keep midband deviation low is a **scientifically rational** path [2][3]. There are no non-scientific claims; results align with measured behavior [1]. Not full-band “±1 dB class,” so not a perfect score.

## Advice

For desks and short-to-medium nearfield setups, the T5V offers a clear midband and wide enough sweet spot. If you need **stronger low-end extension or an even flatter window**, consider the (more expensive) **Kali LP-6 V2 (pair 498.00 USD)** [5][6]. For sub-bass demands, pairing with ADAM’s **T10S** is sensible [2].
