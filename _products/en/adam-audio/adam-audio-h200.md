## Overview

The Adam Audio H200 is the company's first fully in-house headphone design. These closed-back, circumaural headphones use 40 mm PEEK diaphragm drivers and a patent-pending internal airflow structure aimed at combining strong passive isolation with a neutral tuning. At **USD 150**, the H200 targets professional tracking and mix-checking while undercutting much of the field on price. A notable bonus is the included **Headphone Utility** plug-in (developed with Sonnox), which adds crossfeed ("Externalization"), two voicings (Pure / UNR), an earpad selector EQ, and gain compensation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Key manufacturer specifications are solid and unusually transparent for this class:

- **Frequency response (-3 dB): 2 Hz?23.5 kHz**.  
- **THD @ 1 kHz, 100 dB SPL: < 0.02 %**.  
- **Max SPL @ 1 kHz, 0.04 % THD: 112.5 dB SPL**.  
- **Passive attenuation (avg. > 4 kHz): 40 dB**.  
- **Impedance: 32; Sensitivity: 97.5 dB SPL @ 1 mW**.

These figures, combined with consistent third-party impressions of a balanced tonality, support a **borderline-transparent** assessment for a closed-back at this price. While comprehensive independent lab datasets (full FR deviation and multitone distortion sweeps) remain limited, the clearly stated **THD < 0.02 %** and **high-frequency isolation ? 40 dB** are strong indicators for critical work.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PEEK drivers and the patent-pending airflow architecture target typical closed-back trade-offs (bass control vs isolation). The **Headphone Utility** plug-in meaningfully extends monitoring utility with:

- **Voicings:** *Pure* (neutral/flat) and *UNR* (Uniform Natural Response).  
- **Externalization:** crossfeed to approximate loudspeaker presentation.  
- **Earpad Selector** and **Gain Compensation** (Equal Loudness / Safe).

Overall implementation is modern and practical rather than groundbreaking?appropriate for the price tier.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better solution):** *Steven Slate Audio VSX ? Essentials Edition*, **USD 299**. VSX bundles closed-back headphones **with** a comprehensive room/speaker-emulation & crossfeed plug-in, meeting or exceeding H200's functional scope for reference monitoring. Because the **cheapest equal-or-better** option costs **more** than the H200, the H200 attains the maximum **CP = 1.0** here.

> Note: Commonly suggested sub-150 USD studio models (e.g., AKG K371) lack an included plug-in and typically provide lower measured isolation, so they do not qualify as *equal-or-better* on function/performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

- **Warranty:** **2-year** manufacturer warranty for H200. Adam Audio's 5-year extended program **excludes** H200.  
- **Serviceability:** user-replaceable pads/headband padding and dual-sided detachable cable are positives.  
- **Software support:** plug-in supports **macOS 13?15** and **Windows 10/11** in **VST3/AU** hosts.

Given the standard (not extended) warranty and the product's newness, a cautious **0.6** is appropriate.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Adam Audio pursues measurement-led tuning, adds crossfeed through software rather than heavy acoustic compromises, and keeps the hardware robust and serviceable. The approach prioritizes practical accuracy and workflow aids over exotic driver tech?sensible for the target audience and price.

## Advice

If you need closed-back isolation for tracking and mix checks and value a neutral default with an optional, engaging *UNR* voicing, the H200 is an easy recommendation. The free plug-in adds real-world translation benefits. If you specifically require full virtual "mix room" simulations, VSX-class systems deliver more?but at roughly **2~** the price.
