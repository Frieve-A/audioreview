summary: "Tri-amped 3-way midfield with DSP room tuning (A Control) and native Sonarworks integration. Manufacturer measurements indicate wide bandwidth (37 Hz-41 kHz, ±3 dB) and 105 dB SPL @ 3% THD (avg. 100 Hz-6 kHz). With no cheaper equal-or-better alternative confirmed at pair pricing, CP is 1.0."

## Overview

A77H is ADAM Audio's A-Series three-way midfield monitor with dual 7-inch woofers, a 3.5-inch midrange, and the handmade X-ART tweeter in a rotatable HPS waveguide. It adds Ethernet-controlled DSP via **A Control** and native **Sonarworks SoundID** integration for room-adaptive voicings/EQ. Manufacturer specs: frequency response @ ±3 dB **37 Hz-41 kHz** (±6 dB **34 Hz-45 kHz**); max SPL in full space at 1 m with sine bursts (avg. 100 Hz-6 kHz) @ 3% THD **105 dB SPL**; max peak SPL per speaker **106 dB**; IEC-weighted noise **118 dB**. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Public third-party full spin/room-independent datasets for A77H remain limited; therefore we reference clearly stated manufacturer measurements and test conditions. ADAM publishes **37 Hz-41 kHz (±3 dB)** bandwidth and **105 dB SPL @ 3% THD (avg. 100-6 kHz, full space, 1 m)** with additional peak/IEC figures; crossover points are 400 Hz / 3.0 kHz. These are relevant, audibility-linked metrics with conditions disclosed. Score is **0.7**, reflecting solid published performance but scarce independent verification at this time. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Tri-amped Class D platform with per-band amps, Ethernet control, firmware upgradability, and on-speaker Sonarworks filter loading. The **X-ART** tweeter (Air Motion Transformer family) employs a folded diaphragm with a documented **4:1 air-velocity transform**, aiding HF headroom/dispersion when paired with the HPS waveguide. Integration depth (A Control, native SoundID) and modern DSP toolchain justify a high score. [3][4][5][6]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Current market pair price (denominator): 2,999.98 USD (pair).** [7][8]

**Cheapest equal-or-better alternatives (examples, pair pricing):**
- **JBL 708P** — self-powered 2-way with published **>108 dB continuous / >114 dB peak (80 Hz-20 kHz, 1 m)** and broad bandwidth; **3,998.00 USD (pair)**. [9][10]  
- **Neumann KH 310 A** — 3-way; **110.3 dB SPL @ 3% THD (100-6 kHz, full space, 1 m)**; **4,998.00 USD (pair)**. [11][12]

Both meet or exceed user-facing functionality (active, high output, wide bandwidth; DSP/EQ available in ecosystem) and measured output; **neither is cheaper than A77H at pair pricing**. Therefore, per policy, **no cheaper equal-or-better option exists** as of this writing, so **CP = 1.0**. [7][9][11][10][12]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Warranty is **2 years extendable to 5 years upon registration** for A-Series; ADAM maintains ongoing firmware/A Control updates and post-warranty support materials. The mature A-Series DSP platform plus extended coverage supports a high score. [13][14][4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Design choices prioritize **measurable** outcomes (FR control, SPL/THD at declared conditions, dispersion via HPS, room-tunable voicings, on-speaker SoundID). Investment targets performance and workflow rather than cosmetic mass or mystical claims, aligning with a data-driven ethos. [1][3][4][5]

## Advice

A77H suits **midfield distances** where you need high headroom and room-adaptive neutrality from a compact three-way. Use **PURE** voicing for critical work; address placement effects via back-plate EQ/A Control, and consider **on-speaker SoundID** when treatment is constrained. If you need still higher output or a different calibration ecosystem, JBL 7-Series or Neumann KH-Series are viable—but costlier—alternatives.
