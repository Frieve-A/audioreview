## Overview

The A7V is a 7-inch active nearfield monitor that follows the A7X. It pairs an MLM woofer with a handmade X-ART tweeter in a rotatable HPS waveguide and adds DSP-based voicing/PEQ/delay plus **on-speaker** SoundID Reference profile loading via the A Control app. Amplification is hybrid: 90 W RMS (PWM) for woofer and 15 W RMS (Class A/B) for tweeter. Manufacturer specs list 44 Hz–41 kHz (−3 dB) and 105 dB max peak SPL at 1 m. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent measurements report ±2.1 dB ripple (100 Hz–10 kHz), horizontal −6 dB beamwidth ≈120° and vertical ≈90°, usable max 105 dB (3 % THD, 100 Hz–10 kHz), bass capability 99 dB (10 % THD, 50–100 Hz), pair variance 1.3 dB, and noise 25 dBA @10 cm. These align with the manufacturer’s specifications and indicate competent, controlled directivity with size-appropriate LF/HF limits. [1][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The combination of a rotatable HPS waveguide + X-ART tweeter, MLM woofer, per-driver amplification, and firmware-updatable DSP is modern and practical. Crucially, SoundID profiles can be exported and stored on the loudspeaker DSP via A Control, enabling low-latency room adaptation without host processing. [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Price used (pair):** 1,799.98 USD (two units at 899.99 USD each). [5]  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better identified:** **Neumann KH 120 II** (pair 1,898 USD; two units at 949 USD each). It offers **integrated DSP alignment (MA 1)** with calibration data stored/processed in the speakers and shows excellent independent measurements. Because no **cheaper** product with *equivalent DSP functionality* and *equal-or-better measured performance* was found, CP is **1.0**. [6][7][8]

*Equivalence note:* “Integrated room alignment stored on-speaker” and third-party measurements demonstrating low deviation/distortion meet or exceed A7V’s performance. [6][7][8]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Adam provides up to a 5-year warranty upon registration, global service channels, and firmware-updatable DSP via A Control. No widespread reliability issues are documented by credible sources; support and longevity appear slightly above average. [2][3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Design choices emphasize controllable directivity and measurable room adaptation with on-speaker profile storage—rational, user-beneficial pathways to more consistent monitoring. Value depends on room treatment and workflow needs but is coherent for users prioritizing integrated calibration. [2][3][4]

## Advice

Choose A7V if you want a straightforward **A Control + SoundID** workflow with profiles running on the speaker DSP and credible third-party measurements. If you seek the same workflow with demonstrably higher measurement performance and accept a higher price, **Neumann KH 120 II (MA 1)** is a strong option. [3][6][7][8]
