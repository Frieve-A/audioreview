## Overview

The HiBy R4 is an entry-level Android DAP using four ESS ES9018C2M DACs and a Snapdragon 665 platform. Priced at 249 USD, it targets listeners who want a dedicated player rather than a phone-dongle setup. It provides Class-A amplification, 3.5 mm SE and 4.4 mm balanced outputs, and supports high-resolution formats. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate performance in the transparent range for a portable source: balanced dynamic range 124 dB, SNR 123 dB, and THD+N on the order of 0.0005%, with output capability of 525 mW @ 32 Ω (balanced) and 165 mW @ 32 Ω (SE). Independent lab measurements are still limited, but the published electrical data exceed audibility thresholds for noise/distortion and provide ample headroom for typical IEMs; hence 0.7 (above-average) rather than 0.5. [2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The R4 combines mature components (ES9018C2M, OPA1652/OPA1612, Snapdragon 665) in a conventional topology. Class-A biasing is straightforward and not novel in 2025; no proprietary processing or distinctive system-level innovations are evident. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Selecting the cheapest equivalent-or-better finished product for portable playback with balanced out and transparent electrical performance, FiiO’s KA13 dongle meets the brief (balanced 550 mW @ 32 Ω; 4.4 mm output) and is widely available at 65.99 USD from a major retailer. Using the review target price 249 USD as the denominator, CP is 0.3. [3][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

HiBy provides standard 12-month warranty and ongoing firmware support for its Android DAPs; community reports suggest routine reliability with the usual caveats for battery-powered devices. Long-term OS updates typically lag smartphones. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A dedicated Android DAP remains a rational choice for users wanting a self-contained player, hardware volume, and native balanced output. However, versus a modern phone plus a transparent dongle, measured advantages are modest; much of the cost buys standalone convenience rather than higher fidelity. [1][2]

## Advice

If you need a standalone player with balanced out and local storage, the R4 is coherent. If streaming and daily convenience dominate, a transparent dongle (e.g., KA13) with your phone will match fidelity at a fraction of the cost and weight. Prioritize measured needs (output power, noise floor) over internal part counts.
