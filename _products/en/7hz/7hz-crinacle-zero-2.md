summary: "An ultra-budget IEM co-developed by 7Hz and Crinacle. It lightly boosts bass over the original Zero’s neutral tuning and uses a single 10 mm dynamic driver. Third-party measurements show low distortion and well-behaved frequency response. With practical features like 0.78 mm 2-pin connectors, it delivers solid performance around 25 USD."

## Overview

The 7Hz × Crinacle Zero:2 is a single-dynamic IEM tuned for a slightly warmer balance than the original Zero. It includes a detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable. Typical US street price is about 25 USD[1][3]. Public measurement databases indicate a neutral-leaning response with modest bass lift consistent with the design intent[2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent lab measurements show very low distortion: mid/high bands generally below about 0.1% and bass remaining under roughly 0.5%, with a smooth THD curve across the band[1]. Frequency response tracks a neutral target with added bass and without notable narrow-band anomalies[2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This is a straightforward single-DD design without novel multi-way topologies or proprietary processing. Still, the measurement-guided tuning and practical 2-pin implementation are sensible at the price[3]. In terms of originality, it’s competent rather than groundbreaking.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Denominator**: Zero:2 current US street price ≈ 25 USD[1][3].  
**Comparator (Numerator)**: **Moondrop CHU II**, a detachable-cable single-DD IEM with comparable measurement performance (low THD and neutral-aligned FR) at **19 USD**[4][5].  
**Computation**: 19 ÷ 25 ≈ 0.76 → rounded to **0.8**.  
This keeps EN/JA CP scores aligned using the same USD basis.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A lightweight shell and detachable cable aid maintainability. Long-term durability data remain limited at this price tier. Warranty and support terms follow the retailer’s policy; see the seller’s page for specifics[3]. Accessories and replacement parts are easy to source.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Prioritizing low distortion and a target-consistent FR at a minimal price is a rational approach supported by third-party data[1][2]. Since this refines established methods rather than introducing new technology, we cap the score at 0.8.

## Advice

If you want a neutral-tilted wired IEM with a touch more bass, low measured distortion, and a detachable 2-pin cable around 25 USD, Zero:2 is a strong, low-risk pick[1][2]. If you’re strictly minimizing spend while keeping similar objective performance and features, Moondrop CHU II is a credible cheaper alternative to shortlist[4][5]. Final choice should consider fit/seal and your usage environment.
