## Overview

The 7Hz×Crinacle Zero:2 is an ultra-budget 25USD IEM developed through collaboration between Chinese audio manufacturer 7Hz and audio reviewer Crinacle. Building on the success of the original 7Hz Salnotes Zero, it aims for more mainstream appeal by adding 3dB bass enhancement to the neutral tuning. Featuring a 10mm dynamic driver with PU+metal composite diaphragm and newly designed crossover circuitry for improved sound quality. Tuning based on Crinacle's measurement data achieves exceptional acoustic performance for the 25USD price point. The included cable has also been upgraded to high-purity oxygen-free copper with silver plating in coaxial structure.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sound quality improvements of the 7Hz×Crinacle Zero:2 are objectively verifiable through measurement data. Specifications of THD<1%/1kHz, frequency response 10Hz-20kHz, 32Ω, and 108dB/V demonstrate sufficient measured performance for this price range. Crinacle's measurements comparing with the original Zero confirm 3dB bass increase and reduction of harsh peaks in 4-8kHz range, which are physically measurable improvements. ASR reviews praised it as having "almost perfect tonality" and "impressively low distortion," recognizing scientifically-based sound quality improvements. However, distortion from resonance around 1kHz remains, preventing completely transparent reproduction. Data from B&K 5128 and GRAS measurement systems are publicly available, enabling objective verification of claims.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Technically employs industry-standard design approaches. The combination of 10mm dynamic driver and PU+metal composite diaphragm is conventional, but newly designed crossover circuitry enables frequency response optimization. Basic high-quality elements like detachable cable design with 0.78mm 2-pin connector and high-purity oxygen-free copper cable with silver plating are included. Collaboration with Crinacle implements scientific tuning based on measurement data rather than subjective sound crafting, which deserves recognition. However, no fundamental technical innovation is observed, limited to optimization of existing technologies. While sufficient technical standards for this price range, it cannot be considered industry-leading level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Holds overwhelming superiority in price efficiency. A product achieving THD<1%, 32Ω, 108dB/V at 25USD represents world-class affordable pricing in this price segment. Compared to products with equivalent measured specifications like Tanchjim Zero (THD<0.5%, 32Ω, 118dB, 16USD) and Truthear x Crinacle Zero (THD<1%, 10Ω, 117.5dB, 50USD), it achieves excellent price efficiency, making it optimal choice in this price tier. Even compared to Moondrop Chu (20USD), it achieves better acoustic characteristics and build quality for 5USD additional investment, demonstrating extremely high price efficiency. While inferior to Truthear Hexa (80USD) in sound quality, it provides sufficient performance considering the 25USD vs 80USD price difference. No other products with equivalent measured performance exist at this price point, achieving literally world-class price efficiency.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Product reliability is appropriate for the price range. Detachable cable design reduces disconnection risks, but plastic housing durability has limitations. Build quality issues reported with original Zero are supposedly improved in Zero:2, but long-term durability data is limited. Warranty coverage follows retailer (primarily LINSOUL) 1-year warranty, but as mentioned previously, LINSOUL's customer support has issues, limiting practical warranty effectiveness. Replacement ear tips and cables are relatively accessible, ensuring basic maintainability. While reasonable reliability level considering price, durability equivalent to high-priced products cannot be expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Design philosophy is extremely rational. Crinacle's measurement data-based scientific approach aims for objective measurement optimization rather than subjective "musicality." Addresses original Zero's neutral but bass-deficient issue with 3dB bass enhancement, achieving more mainstream acoustic characteristics. Reducing harsh peaks in 4-8kHz range also addresses listening fatigue. Design prioritizing price-performance balance pursues maximum acoustic performance within 25USD constraints. However, extreme low-price pursuit sacrifices some durability and premium feel, making it not completely rational. Nevertheless, it can be evaluated as extremely rational design for the clear goal of maximizing price efficiency.

## Advice

The 7Hz×Crinacle Zero:2 represents the current best choice for users prioritizing pure price efficiency above all else. No other products achieving this measured performance at 25USD exist, making it the optimal solution under budget constraints. Also recommended for users dissatisfied with original Zero's overly neutral sound or seeking more mainstream appeal. However, for long-term durability and premium feel requirements, consider expanding budget to approximately 80USD for Truthear Hexa. For gaming applications, original Zero may be more suitable in some cases, requiring purpose-based selection. Only recommended for users who understand customer support issues and can tolerate initial defect risks. For those prioritizing price efficiency over absolute sound quality levels, this represents the current best choice.
