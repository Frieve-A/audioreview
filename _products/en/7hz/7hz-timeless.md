summary: "The 7Hz Timeless was a revolutionary 14.2mm planar magnetic IEM that sparked the 'planar war' when released in 2021. Originally priced at USD220, it brought kilogram-class audio quality to the masses and significantly contributed to the popularization of planar IEMs. While technically competent with characteristic planar low distortion and fast transient response, the 2024 release of Timeless II has rendered the original largely obsolete. With numerous excellent planar IEMs now available under USD90 and the superior Timeless II at USD229, the original Timeless faces strong headwinds in the current competitive landscape."

## Overview

The 7Hz Timeless, released in 2021, was a landmark product that revolutionized the planar IEM market. Featuring a 14.2mm planar magnetic driver, it became the world's first practical planar IEM at the competitive price of USD220, taking the market by storm. With its 2mm ultra-thin diaphragm, 14.8ฮฉ impedance, and 104dB sensitivity, it employs CNC aluminum housing and MMCX cable, supporting various terminations including 3.5mm, 2.5mm, and 4.4mm. The characteristic planar high-speed response and low distortion properties deliver excellent clarity and technical performance.

**Important Note**: The 7Hz Timeless II was released in late 2024 at USD229, featuring significant improvements including a 14.5mm driver, dual-sided silver alloy-coated diaphragm, and four interchangeable tuning nozzles. This review evaluates the original Timeless in the context of the current market, including the availability of its successor.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The adoption of planar magnetic technology achieves a fundamentally different driving principle compared to dynamic drivers or BA drivers. Measurement data confirms characteristic planar low distortion properties, with particularly excellent transient response scientifically verified. The frequency response is generally well-balanced, though the 8-10kHz peak has been noted as potentially measurement artifacts by some sources. However, multiple units have reported channel matching issues in upper midrange and treble regions, raising concerns about manufacturing quality consistency. While this issue doesn't significantly impact subjective listening, it is clearly observable in measurements. The planar technology itself remains scientifically sound with measurable advantages over dynamic drivers.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The implementation of the 14.2mm planar driver was groundbreaking for 2021. The combination of ultra-thin diaphragm and magnetic system achieves high-speed response difficult for conventional dynamic drivers. The precision machining of the CNC aluminum housing also demonstrates technical completion. MMCX connectors and balanced connection support ensure system expandability. However, from current technical standards, the channel matching issues suggest limitations in manufacturing technology, raising questions about technical completion. As of 2024, more affordable planar IEMs with more consistent quality exist, and the Timeless II represents a significant technical advancement over the original.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

With the Timeless II now available at USD229 featuring superior technology and the original Timeless still priced around USD200-220, the cost-performance ratio has deteriorated significantly. Multiple excellent planar IEMs under USD90 now exist, such as the Letshuoer S12 Pro (USD129) and Kiwi Ears Aether (USD169, often on sale for USD122). The Timeless II offers substantially better value at only USD9 more with upgraded drivers, better manufacturing quality, and tuning flexibility. CP calculation: USD122 (Aether sale price) รท USD200 (Timeless current price) = 0.61. However, considering the Timeless II's superior value proposition at USD229, the original Timeless faces severe competitive pressure. While acknowledging its revolutionary historical value, pure price-performance comparison places it at a clear disadvantage.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

7Hz has established a reasonable track record as a Chinese audio equipment manufacturer with standard quality control. The MMCX connector adoption facilitates cable replacement and repair. However, the reported channel matching issues across multiple reviews indicate room for improvement in manufacturing process quality control. Warranty periods and after-sales support are industry standard without particular advantages. While theoretical durability of planar drivers is excellent for long-term use, actual failure rate data is limited. The release of Timeless II suggests 7Hz has addressed many of the original's manufacturing issues.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of planar magnetic technology itself is scientifically rational, offering clear technical advantages in low distortion and high-speed response. The USD220 price point was revolutionary for 2021. However, considering the 2024 market situation, equivalent technology can be provided at lower cost, making the current pricing less rational. The decision to continue marketing the original Timeless without addressing channel matching issues while releasing the superior Timeless II contradicts a quality-first design philosophy. While technical advantages exist, the overall design philosophy appears outdated in the current market context.

## Advice

The 7Hz Timeless was historically important but cannot be recommended for purchase in 2025. The 7Hz Timeless II at USD229 offers superior technology, better manufacturing quality, and tuning flexibility, making it the clear choice for anyone interested in 7Hz's planar technology. For those seeking planar IEMs under USD150, excellent options include the Letshuoer S12 Pro (USD129) and Kiwi Ears Aether (USD169, often USD122 on sale). The original Timeless should only be considered for collection purposes as a commemoration of the planar IEM revolution. For practical use, the current market offers numerous better options, with the Timeless II being the obvious upgrade path for 7Hz enthusiasts.

**Current Market Recommendation**: 7Hz Timeless II (USD229) for 7Hz brand preference, or Letshuoer S12 Pro (USD129) for budget-conscious planar IEM seekers.
