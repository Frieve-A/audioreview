## Overview

The 7Hz Salnotes Zero is an ultra-budget single-DD IEM that goes for a **neutral-bright** balance rather than the warmer tunings common at this price. It features a 10 mm dynamic driver with a metal-composite diaphragm, a detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, and a stainless-steel faceplate[1]. Street price at Linsoul for the 3.5 mm, no-mic version is **USD 22.99** (as of 2025-08-14)[1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

- **Frequency Response**: Independent IEC60318-4/IEC711 measurements show an overall **neutral-bright** signature with elevated upper-mids/treble; the ~8 kHz bump is a coupler artefact and data above ~10 kHz should be treated cautiously[2].  
- **Distortion**: Manufacturer spec lists **THD < 1% @ 1 kHz**[1], reasonable for this class.  
- **Drive Requirements**: With **108 dB/V @ 1 kHz** sensitivity and **>32 Ω** impedance[1], the SPL for a given voltage is:
  ```
  V_94dB = 10^((94-108)/20) ≈ 0.20 Vrms
  ```
  So ~102 dB at 0.5 Vrms and ~108 dB at 1 Vrms—well within the output of typical phones/DAC-dongles.  
- **Caveat**: The FR peak around **5–6 kHz** can sound spicy depending on tips and listener sensitivity[2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A competent, no-nonsense design: 10 mm DD with N52 magnet and metal-composite diaphragm, detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin, and a 4-core OFC cable (19×0.08 + 250D)[1]. Materials (steel faceplate + plastic shell) are solid for the price, though nothing here is groundbreaking.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Among detachable-cable IEMs with **comparable or better measured performance**, the **TANGZU Wan’er S.G** is a key price anchor at **USD 19.00** on Linsoul[3]. IEC711 measurements describe it as **warm-neutral** with a smoother treble balance[4].  
**Calculation**: 19.00 ÷ 22.99 = **0.83**.  
Zero costs ~17% more than the cheapest equal-or-better option but remains highly competitive if you prefer a brighter, crisper presentation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Linsoul lists **1-year IEM** and **3-month cable** warranty[1]. Detachable cabling improves longevity versus fixed-cable sets. Accessories are basic; **a carrying case is not included**[1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The goal—**objectively-leaning neutrality at a rock-bottom price**—is coherent and largely achieved. The trade-off is a potentially fatiguing treble peak for sensitive listeners; otherwise, the design prioritizes clarity and measurables in a cost-effective way.

## Advice

- Great for listeners wanting clarity and a neutral-bright balance on a tight budget.  
- If you prefer a smoother treble/warmer tilt, also consider **TANGZU Wan’er S.G**[3][4].  
- Tip rolling (e.g., foam or thicker-bore silicone) can help tame the **5–6 kHz** zing noted in measurements[2].
