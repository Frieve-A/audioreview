## Overview

The 7HZ Salnotes Zero launched July 27, 2022 as a budget IEM featuring 10mm dynamic driver with metal composite diaphragm technology. Priced at 20.99 USD, it targets the sub-25 USD market with 32Ω impedance and 108dB/V sensitivity. The product "paved the way for the budget IEM bracket" by democratizing quality audio performance. Available in six colors with detachable 0.78mm 2-pin OFC cable, it represents 7HZ's second dynamic driver model following their established trajectory in affordable audio engineering. The ZERO philosophy emphasizes "limitless imagination and boundless possibilities" through accessible pricing.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third-party measurements from AudioScience Review show THD characterized as "impressively low" with exception of minor resonance around 1kHz, placing performance between excellent threshold 0.05% and problematic threshold 0.5% [1]. Frequency response demonstrates "near-perfect ASR target compliance" with estimated deviation of ±3.0dB meeting standard threshold ±3dB but falling short of excellent level ±1dB [1]. SoundGuys confirms 61.1% noise isolation, approaching excellent threshold 30dB while significantly exceeding problematic threshold 10dB [2]. Group delay shows "very clean" performance with anomaly around 1kHz region. Score reflects transparent level performance with borderline positioning between standard and excellent categories across key metrics.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The metal composite diaphragm represented innovative technology in 2022 but has since become common across manufacturers [3]. N52 neodymium magnet system and 10mm dynamic driver utilize established technologies with proprietary implementation. In-house design demonstrates engineering capability through exclusive development of composite materials and fine-tuning techniques. However, lack of lasting competitive advantage limits technology advancement score. Evolution to Zero:2 with upgraded PU+Metal composite shows continued development but represents incremental rather than revolutionary progress. Analog-only approach without digital signal processing or advanced driver topologies constrains technological sophistication within moderate category.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Cost-performance calculation: CP = 16.79 USD / 20.99 USD = 0.8. Comparison product Moondrop Chu II demonstrates equivalent measured performance with AudioScience Review reporting "extremely good results" for THD versus target's "impressively low" rating, and "very small gaps compared to target" for frequency response versus target's "near-perfect ASR target compliance" [4]. Both products maintain core IEM functions including detachable 0.78mm 2-pin cables and passive noise isolation capabilities. This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Moondrop Chu II's pricing at 16.79 USD delivers equivalent AudioScience Review-verified technical specifications and measurement results.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Standard reliability framework with 1-year IEM warranty and 3-month cable coverage through authorized retailer network [5]. Some reported issues include occasional channel imbalance after extended use, Type-C version compatibility concerns, and stock cable wear patterns near microphone areas. Support operates through dealer-based system providing global coverage but lacks direct manufacturer service infrastructure. Simple dynamic driver design offers inherent robustness offsetting short warranty period. Detachable cable system enables replacement of wear-prone components. Limited parts availability for discontinued items constrains long-term serviceability. Standard offering balanced by dealer network reach and component-level repairability through aftermarket cable ecosystem.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

7HZ demonstrates highly rational design philosophy through democratic audio approach, allocating costs toward performance rather than premium materials or marketing. Systematic model improvements from Zero to Zero:2 show measurable benefits including +3dB low-end enhancement and upgraded PU+Metal diaphragm. Active cost reduction through efficient production techniques enables 20.99 USD pricing while maintaining quality standards. Development of proprietary metal composite diaphragm technology created lasting value. Collaborative development with measurement-oriented reviewer Crinacle balances subjective tuning with objective verification. Philosophy of "limitless imagination and boundless possibilities" translates into accessible pricing democratizing quality audio rather than empty marketing rhetoric. Evidence-based evolutionary improvements demonstrate rational engineering approach.

## Advice

The 7HZ Salnotes Zero serves users seeking transparent audio performance without premium pricing. Recommended for budget-conscious listeners prioritizing neutral frequency response and low distortion over advanced features. Avoid Type-C microphone version due to compatibility concerns. Consider cable upgrade given stock quality characteristics. Suitable for portable devices requiring minimal amplification due to 32Ω impedance and 108dB/V sensitivity. Alternative Moondrop Chu II offers equivalent performance. Zero:2 variant provides incremental improvements for slight price premium. Target audience includes entry-level enthusiasts and cost-conscious users valuing measurement-verified performance over subjective tuning claims.
