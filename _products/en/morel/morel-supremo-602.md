## Overview

The Morel Supremo 602 is a 6.5" ultra high-end component speaker system featuring Morel's proprietary EVC (External Voice Coil) technology. This handcrafted flagship system includes woofers with carbon fiber cones, silk dome tweeters with Acuflex coating, and external crossovers. Developed by a company with 45 years of speaker manufacturing experience, the system represents Morel's no-compromise approach to automotive audio reproduction. Based on Japanese car audio market pricing of 864,000円 for automotive speaker units.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Supremo 602's scientific validity is constrained by limited third-party measurement data. Manufacturer specifications indicate 30-25,000 Hz frequency response, 89 dB sensitivity, and 140W RMS power handling [1]. While comprehensive independent measurements from recognized labs are not available, the specified frequency response range falls within standard car speaker territory. Car speaker systems typically achieve 0.1-1% THD levels, which places them in the problematic to borderline range of measurement criteria for speakers. The EVC technology and premium materials suggest potential for improved distortion performance, but verification requires independent testing. Current evaluation relies on manufacturer specifications pending third-party validation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Supremo 602 demonstrates significant technical sophistication through Morel's proprietary EVC technology, utilizing voice coils three times larger than conventional designs with underhung 3-inch Hexatech aluminum voice coils [2]. The implementation includes powerful neodymium magnets, carbon fiber and Rohacell sandwich cone construction, and Acuflex-coated silk dome tweeters with dual neodymium motor systems. Complete in-house design and manufacturing control enables technical flexibility and rapid innovation. However, the purely analog/mechanical approach lacks modern digital signal processing or software integration that characterizes current-generation audio systems.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

139,000円 ÷ 864,000円 = 0.16

The Supremo 602 shows poor cost-performance compared to the cheapest equivalent alternative. The Pioneer TS-Z65C component system provides equivalent-or-better specifications with 100W RMS power handling, 32Hz-96kHz frequency response, and Hi-Res Audio certification at approximately 139,000円 (930 USD) [3]. Equipped with 2-way component design, aluminum dome tweeters, Twaron aramid fiber cones, and external crossovers matching core functionality, the Pioneer system achieves equivalent performance at 16% of the Supremo 602's Japanese market price of 864,000円.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Morel provides above-average reliability through robust construction utilizing neodymium magnets and premium materials inherently resistant to degradation. Each unit undergoes hand assembly and seven distinct quality control tests before shipment [1]. The company's 45-year manufacturing history demonstrates proven longevity, supported by global dealer network infrastructure. Standard 2-year warranty coverage aligns with industry norms, while the simple analog construction minimizes potential failure points compared to complex electronic systems.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Morel's design philosophy demonstrates scientific rationality through systematic technological advancement. The EVC technology utilizing oversized 3-inch voice coils addresses genuine thermal and mechanical limitations of conventional designs through engineering solutions [2]. The Acuflex damping compound and carbon fiber cone construction target measurable improvements in resonance control and cone behavior. Complete in-house design and manufacturing enables quality consistency and technical innovation. However, the approach focuses on premium materials and craftsmanship rather than cost-effective implementation of equivalent performance, resulting in substantial price premiums for technological solutions that could be achieved through more economical means.

## Advice

The Supremo 602 targets buyers prioritizing ultra-premium construction and proprietary EVC technology over cost-effectiveness. Purchasers seeking equivalent audio performance should consider the Pioneer TS-Z65C alternative, which provides comparable specifications at significantly lower cost. The premium of 864,000円 reflects handcrafted construction and brand positioning rather than measurable performance advantages, making this product suitable for buyers prioritizing exclusivity and artisanal manufacturing processes.
