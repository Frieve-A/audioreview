## Overview

The QCY MeloBuds ANC (HT05) is a wireless earbud announced by Chinese audio manufacturer QCY in late 2022. It features 40dB hybrid active noise cancelling functionality and was initially sold for 7,980 JPY, but is now available for around 4,000 JPY. It adopts a 10mm LCP (Liquid Crystal Polymer) driver and Bluetooth 5.2, offering up to 30 hours of playback time and IPX5 water resistance. As QCY's initial ANC-equipped product model, it established the company's technical foundation, but its technological superiority has relatively declined with the introduction of the successor MeloBuds Pro.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 40dB ANC performance reaches the ideal range (40dB or higher) in the measurement results standard table, confirming audible improvement effects in mid-low frequency noise reduction. The ENC function with 6 microphones contributes to objective improvement in call quality, and the IPX5 water resistance provides a practical protection level. However, Bluetooth 5.2 does not support LDAC and has not obtained Hi-Res Audio certification, limiting its scientific superiority in sound quality aspects. While the frequency response covers 20Hz-20kHz, detailed THD and SNR values are not disclosed, making it difficult to confirm transparent level achievement. The ANC performance certainly provides audible improvements, but it is positioned inferior in scientific validity compared to newer 46dB class ANC products.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 10mm LCP driver and hybrid ANC system met industry standards as of 2022, but remain at average levels from current technological standards. While Bluetooth 5.2 adoption was cutting-edge at the time, the lack of LDAC support left it behind in high-quality codec compatibility. The 3 ANC modes and 6-level ambient sound control provide basic adaptability, but do not include AI-adaptive systems like the successor MeloBuds Pro. The WQ7003AR chip shows standard performance in connection stability, but no technical uniqueness or innovation is recognized. Multi-point connection and wear detection functions are also absent, presenting functional limitations compared to current technological standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The current price of the QCY MeloBuds ANC is approximately 4,000 JPY. The main competing product, Soundcore Life A3i with 40dB class ANC performance, sells for about 7,000 JPY, making QCY the provider of equivalent ANC functionality at a lower price. 7,000 JPY รท 4,000 JPY = 1.75, indicating that QCY is the world's cheapest option with equivalent functionality and measurement performance. Both products feature 40dB class ANC, IPX5 water resistance, and 6 hours of continuous playback time, with limited differences in core functions. While the Life A3i has superiority in multi-point connection, QCY provides the highest cost-performance by achieving equivalent ANC performance at the lowest price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

IPX5 water resistance ensures basic durability for daily use, and QCY's dedicated app firmware update support demonstrates ongoing support. The product has continued market sales for over 2 years since release, suggesting certain quality stability. However, specific failure rate data and MTBF values are not disclosed, and warranty periods remain at standard levels. While QCY has established quality control systems as a Chinese manufacturer, it is positioned inferior in long-term reliability track record compared to established Japanese, European, and American audio brands. The support system meets basic levels but cannot be expected to provide comprehensive services like premium brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The 40dB ANC performance target demonstrates a rational approach to achieving transparent levels based on scientific evidence. The adoption of 10mm LCP drivers is an acoustically sound choice that contributes to frequency response improvement. The implementation of hybrid ANC systems follows physical principles of noise reduction, and the ENC function with 6 microphones is a scientific method for call quality improvement. Ensuring IPX5 water resistance is a rational decision emphasizing practicality, and the 30-hour battery design is a realistic specification considering daily use convenience. No unscientific claims or occult audio elements are observed, and the design philosophy focused on measurable performance improvements is highly commendable. Achieving ANC at the 4,000 JPY price point clearly presents the existence significance as specialized equipment that is difficult to replace with general-purpose devices.

## Advice

The QCY MeloBuds ANC becomes an attractive choice for budget-conscious users through its value proposition of providing 40dB ANC functionality for around 4,000 JPY. With the Soundcore Life A3i offering equivalent ANC performance selling for 7,000 JPY, the 3,000 JPY price difference provides significant economic benefits. However, since the successor QCY MeloBuds Pro offers 46dB ANC, LDAC support, and multi-point connection for around 5,500 JPY, it is also possible to choose a higher-performance product with an additional 1,500 JPY investment. The MeloBuds ANC is suitable for users seeking basic ANC functionality and adequate sound quality while minimizing budget, but for those seeking latest features and high-quality codec support, the successor model would be a more appropriate choice. Its current position is as a product providing entry-level ANC experience.
