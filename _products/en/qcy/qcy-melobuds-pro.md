## Overview

The QCY MeloBuds Pro is a wireless earphone released in 2024 by Chinese audio manufacturer QCY. It achieves 46dB hybrid active noise cancellation, LDAC support, and Hi-Res Audio certification at approximately 38 USD, earning the VGP 2025 Gold Award. Equipped with 12mm dynamic drivers and Bluetooth 5.3, it offers up to 34 hours of playbook time and IPX5 water resistance. QCY has gained attention for its recent technological improvements, and this product represents a showcase of the company's technical progress.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 46dB ANC performance exceeds the ideal range (40dB or higher) in the measurement standards table, achieving near-transparent noise isolation performance. LDAC support enables high bitrate transmission of 990kbps, and Hi-Res Audio certification demonstrates measurable audio quality improvements. The ENC function with 6 microphones also contributes to objective call quality improvements. However, specific THD and SNR values are not disclosed, and detailed measurement data for frequency response is lacking, preventing full confirmation of transparent level achievement. While ANC performance and LDAC support certainly provide audible improvements, more detailed measurement data validation is desired.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 12mm bio-diaphragm driver and adaptive ANC system meet current industry standards, but innovation is limited. Bluetooth 5.3 and LDAC support comply with latest technical standards, and the adaptive system with 5 ANC modes shows moderate technical sophistication. The VGP 2025 Gold Award demonstrates industry recognition, but this is due to proper implementation of existing technologies rather than technical breakthroughs. Multipoint connection and IPX5 water resistance are also standard implementation levels. Compared to the competing Anker Space A40, no technical superiority is recognized, and it is rather positioned somewhat inferior.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The QCY MeloBuds Pro is priced at approximately 38 USD. The main competing product, Anker Soundcore Space A40, costs approximately 47 USD and provides equivalent ANC performance, LDAC support, and multipoint connection. Since the QCY MeloBuds Pro offers the same level of functionality at a lower price point, it achieves the maximum cost-performance score. Both products feature 46dB-class ANC, LDAC support, 10-hour playback time, and multipoint connection, with limited substantial functional differences. While the Space A40 has an advantage with 50 hours total playback time compared to the MeloBuds Pro's 34 hours, the 9 USD price difference makes the QCY the more economical choice for users seeking equivalent core functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The VGP 2025 Gold Award demonstrates product quality reliability. IPX5 water resistance ensures durability for daily use, and QCY's dedicated app firmware update support suggests ongoing support. However, specific failure rate data and MTBF values are not disclosed, and detailed information about warranty periods and repair systems is lacking. As a Chinese manufacturer, QCY has been improving quality in recent years, but long-term reliability track record is inferior to established Western and Japanese manufacturers. The support system is evaluated as standard level, but the thoroughness of premium brands cannot be expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

LDAC support and Hi-Res Audio certification demonstrate a rational approach to measurable audio quality improvement. The 46dB ANC performance target is based on scientific evidence toward achieving transparent level. The adaptive ANC system is implemented according to acoustic engineering principles, and multipoint connection is a rational feature that enhances practical value. The ENC implementation with 6 microphones is also a scientific approach to call quality improvement. No unscientific claims or occult audio elements are observed, and the design philosophy focused on measurable performance improvements is highly commendable. However, as a 38 USD wireless earphone, it has specialized functionality that is difficult to replace with general-purpose devices, so its reason for existence is clear.

## Advice

The QCY MeloBuds Pro represents excellent value for users seeking ANC and LDAC support, offering equivalent functionality to the Anker Space A40 at 9 USD less cost. At 38 USD, it provides 46dB ANC performance and audio quality that reach practical levels with superior cost-performance in this price range. While the Anker Space A40 offers longer total playback time (50 vs 34 hours), the significant price difference makes the QCY the more rational choice for budget-conscious users. For those prioritizing maximum battery life over cost savings, the Space A40 remains a viable alternative, but the MeloBuds Pro offers the best value proposition. The 34-hour battery life is practically sufficient for most users, making this an outstanding choice in the budget ANC category.
