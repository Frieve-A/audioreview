## Overview

The QCY HT07 (ArcBuds) is a budget-tier active noise canceling true wireless earphone released by Chinese audio manufacturer QCY in 2023. Despite its price point of 4,200 JPY, it incorporates features comparable to higher-end models, including up to 40dB hybrid ANC, 10mm dynamic drivers, a 6-microphone array for improved call quality, and IPX5 water resistance. QCY, established in 2009, has been known for cost-effective audio products, and the HT07 continues this legacy.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Reliable third-party measurement data regarding the acoustic performance of the QCY HT07 is limited. While nominal specifications claim a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz, Bluetooth 5.2 support, and up to 40dB of ANC performance, objective data showing actual measurements for THD (Total Harmonic Distortion), S/N ratio, or ANC effectiveness could not be confirmed. It is unclear if the product performs according to its nominal specifications, making an objective evaluation of its sound quality difficult.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The HT07 employs 10mm dynamic drivers and the WQ7003AR chipset, featuring a standard configuration with a hybrid ANC architecture that places microphones both inside and outside. Implementations in line with current technical standards are confirmed, including a 6-microphone array for improved call quality, AI processing for voice enhancement, and automatic switching between three ANC modes (indoor, outdoor, transportation). However, the technologies used are a combination of existing general-purpose solutions, with limited uniqueness or technical advantages. While it meets current standards with Bluetooth 5.2 support and a low-latency gaming mode, cutting-edge technological innovations are not evident. The technology level is evaluated as average compared to competitive products in the same price range.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The QCY HT07 is priced at 4,200 JPY. The most affordable class of competing products with equivalent ANC functionality (nominal), Bluetooth codec support, and IPX5 water resistance is the Soundcore Space A40, at approximately 8,000 JPY. Because the HT07 achieves a world-class lowest price among products with equivalent functions, its cost-performance receives the highest rating of 1.0. No other products offering 40dB-class hybrid ANC, a 6-microphone array, 32-hour total playback time, and dedicated app support at this price have been confirmed. It achieves extremely high cost-performance by providing the basic functions users demand at a minimal cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

QCY is a Chinese audio manufacturer established in 2009 with over 15 years of experience, but reliability data is limited compared to premium brands. The HT07 includes a standard product warranty and supports firmware updates through a dedicated app, but the update frequency and long-term support track record remain unclear. User reviews indicate that initial defect rates are at a general level, but data on long-term durability is insufficient. The support system is limited to basic email correspondence, without comprehensive options like phone support or real-time chat. It is evaluated as having industry-average reliability and support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The QCY HT07's design philosophy focuses on providing practical ANC functionality within a limited budget, adopting a rational approach. It selects technical elements that could contribute to sound quality improvement for its price, such as a hybrid ANC architecture and multiple microphones for enhanced call quality. It also provides flexibility to accommodate diverse user applications through EQ adjustment via a dedicated app and a low-latency gaming mode. However, detailed DAC chip specifications and specific acoustic design innovations are limited. Realistic design decisions prioritizing practicality within price constraints have been made, avoiding excessive feature additions or unscientific claims. It can be evaluated as having a rational design philosophy emphasizing cost efficiency.

## Advice

The QCY HT07 is suitable for those who want to try ANC earphones for the first time or seek basic noise cancellation functionality while keeping the budget low. At 4,200 JPY, it offers hybrid ANC, IPX5 water resistance, and 32-hour playback, providing world-class cost-performance among products with equivalent functionality. However, objective measurement data is lacking, and it is uncertain whether the actual ANC performance and sound quality match the nominal specifications. It is not suitable for those seeking flat acoustic characteristics or high-precision sound reproduction. For those prioritizing long-term support or high reliability, considering products from manufacturers with more established track records is recommended. It is a valuable choice for users who prioritize cost above all and want to obtain practical ANC functionality at the lowest price.
