## Overview

The QCY H3 Pro is a budget over-ear with LDAC (Hi-Res Wireless), Bluetooth 5.4, multipoint, and manufacturer-rated "up to 50 dB" adaptive ANC. Battery is listed at 55 h (ANC off) / ~40 h (ANC on), with 10-min quick charge ? 2 h. A 3.5 mm input is provided; in passive wired mode the headset disables ANC, microphones, and touch controls, and app EQ/DSP does not apply. Price at the official store is **56.99 USD**. [2][3][4]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Independent testing reports frequency-response irregularities: a broad **bass depression** and a **notch around ~8 kHz**, which become prominent when EQ/DSP is bypassed (e.g., passive wired). The ANC "50 dB" figure is a peak marketing claim; standardized broadband attenuation data are not provided. Measured stamina under controlled use was **~28 h** with **LDAC + adaptive ANC** versus **~40 h** with **SBC + adaptive ANC**, consistent with codec power deltas. These data support a below-transparent baseline without EQ. [1][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Feature set (LDAC, BT 5.4, multipoint, app EQ) and implementation are mainstream for 2024?2025. Teardown identifies a common Bluetooth SoC and conventional hybrid ANC topology; there is no evidence of novel codec/algorithmic advances or distinctive acoustic engineering beyond class norms. [4]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Denominator (review target): 56.99 USD.** We surveyed equal-or-better over-ear options with **LDAC + ANC** and found **EarFun Wave Pro** as the **cheapest verified comparator at 79.99 USD** (official announcement and retail listings). Since no equal-or-better option was found **below** 56.99 USD, **CP = 1.0** by definition. Selection rationale: same core user-visible functions (LDAC, ANC, app EQ, multipoint) and credible third-party confirmation of price. [2][5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Typical one-year warranty and global retail presence suggest average support for the segment. Build and assembly quality appear adequate in teardown; measured runtimes align with catalog claims (codec-dependent). Long-term durability data are still limited. [4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Prioritizing headline specs (LDAC, "50 dB" ANC) over baseline acoustic linearity leads to reliance on EQ/DSP for acceptable tonality, especially evident when DSP is unavailable (passive wired). Still, choices like multipoint and long battery life are practical and user-centric. [1][2][4]

## Advice

If you need **LDAC + ANC + multipoint** at the lowest entry price, H3 Pro delivers. Use app EQ in Bluetooth mode to correct FR quirks; for latency-sensitive use, switch to SBC/LC3 or go wired (accepting no ANC/EQ). If you want better out-of-box tuning without EQ, consider stepping up to alternatives like EarFun Wave Pro despite the higher price. [1][5]
