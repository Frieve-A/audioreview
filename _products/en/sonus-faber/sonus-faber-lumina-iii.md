## Overview

The Sonus Faber Lumina III is a 3-way floorstanding speaker positioned at the entry level of the company's lineup. It features a 1.14-inch DAD (Damped Apex Dome) tweeter, 5-inch pulp cone midrange, and dual 5-inch pulp cone woofers, with crossover points at 350Hz and 3.5kHz. Priced at 2,457 USD in the Japanese market, it shares tweeter and midrange drivers with the company's higher-end Sonetto series. The product is positioned as showcasing Italian design beauty and traditional woodworking techniques.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Detailed measurements by Stereophile magazine confirm several issues. The tweeter output shows boosting in the highest frequencies, with a peak remaining at 10kHz even when averaged over a 30-degree horizontal window. The midbass is slightly shelved down, requiring close placement to rear walls for optimal low-frequency reproduction. Impedance drops to 3.3 ohms at 123Hz and falls to 3 ohms between 450-560Hz, falling below the 4-ohm nominal value. Port tuning frequency is set around 47Hz. Sensitivity measures 91dB/2.83V/m compared to the nominal 89dB/2.83V/m specification, showing slightly higher values. These measurement results do not reach transparent levels and raise concerns about audible effects in the listening range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of the same DAD tweeter and 5-inch midrange units from the higher-end Sonetto series is commendable, but the newly designed 5-inch woofer combines conventional technologies of paper pulp cone and rubber roll surround. The crossover design follows standard approaches with no notable technical innovations. Driver placement and cabinet design remain within industry-standard practices. While the company's technical accumulation is utilized, technological advantages are limited considering the price range. Modern digital signal processing or active control technologies are not adopted, and aggressive technical investment toward improved measured performance cannot be confirmed.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Against the price of 2,457 USD, products offering equivalent or superior functionality and measured performance include the ELAC Debut 2.0 F5.2 (990 USD). This product is a 3-way bass-reflex floorstanding speaker with 42-35kHz (±3dB) frequency response, 86dB sensitivity, and 6-ohm nominal impedance. It adopts sophisticated acoustic engineering by Andrew Jones and advanced driver technologies including aramid fiber woofers. The calculation 990 USD ÷ 2,457 USD = 0.403, rounded to a score of 0.4. In the same price range, products like the Wharfedale Diamond 12.3 (667 USD) also provide equivalent or superior measured performance, making the Lumina III's pricing unreasonable. Excluding Italian design brand value, a significant price premium exists in pure performance-to-price ratio.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sonus Faber is an established Italian audio manufacturer founded in 1983, with a globally established sales and support system. Appropriate after-sales service through authorized dealers can be expected in Japan. Product quality control is also considered to meet general industry standards. However, firmware update elements do not apply to this product. Warranty periods and repair systems also provide standard levels expected from international high-end audio manufacturers. The company's long-term market track record provides a certain level of confidence in terms of reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

It adopts a conventional passive speaker design approach with no unscientific claims or occult elements observed. However, aggressive improvement approaches to frequency response issues confirmed in measurements are insufficient. The adoption of paper cone drivers is an acoustically understandable choice, but no significant advantages are confirmed compared to modern high-performance alternative materials. Cabinet design and port design also follow general practices with no innovative approaches observed. Considering the price range, more aggressive efforts toward measured performance improvement are expected. The design policy itself is within rational bounds, but the orientation toward performance improvement commensurate with cost is unclear.

## Advice

When considering the purchase of the Lumina III, we strongly recommend careful comparison with alternative choices in the same price range. For those prioritizing pure acoustic performance, products like the ELAC Debut 2.0 F5.2 and Wharfedale Diamond 12.3 offer significantly superior cost-performance. Only if you value the design aesthetics and ownership experience of the Sonus Faber brand and can accept compromises in measured performance should this be considered as an option. For installation, close placement to rear walls is recommended based on measurement results. When selecting amplifiers, consider the impedance characteristics that drop to 3 ohms and choose equipment with high low-impedance driving capability. When considering long-term acoustic system construction, it is important to recognize that numerous options exist that can utilize limited budgets more efficiently.
