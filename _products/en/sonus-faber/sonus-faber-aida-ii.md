summary: "Aida II blends proprietary acoustical mechanisms with artisanal cabinetry. Independent lab data is available mainly for the preceding Aida (2018), so Scientific Validity stays around average. Technology Level is solid thanks to in-house mechanisms, but cost-performance is extremely poor versus cheaper systems that deliver equal-or-better measured transparency (e.g., Neumann KH 420 ×2 + KH 750 ×2)."

## Overview

Aida II is Sonus Faber’s flagship floorstander featuring the “Sound Field Shaper,” “Stealth Ultraflex,” and a curved wooden enclosure. Manufacturer specs cite 92dB/2.83V/1m sensitivity and 18Hz–35kHz bandwidth; dimensions are 1725mm tall with a net pair weight of 330kg[1]. Third-party measurements in the public domain cover the **preceding** Aida model (2018), not Aida II per se, so we prioritize those for objective context and mark Aida II figures as manufacturer specs[1][2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Because independent measurements specific to **Aida II** are scarce, we start from the policy baseline (0.5) and adjust with available facts. The earlier Aida measured 90.5dB/2.83V/1m, with impedance minima of 2.23Ω (35Hz) and 2.33Ω (11.3–14kHz); combined LF output extended to a true 20Hz, though a broad 30–120Hz peak was present[2]. Given the close architecture and manufacturer claims for Aida II, similar audible outcomes are plausible, but without Aida II-specific distortion/directivity datasets we refrain from additional credit[1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Proprietary mechanisms (Stealth Ultraflex, Zero Vibration Transmission, Sound Field Shaper) and in-house drivers indicate solid engineering ownership[1]. That said, relative to state-of-the-art active monitors with rigorous computer-optimized directivity and DSP integration (e.g., Neumann KH series), Aida II’s largely mechanical/analog emphasis warrants only a moderate boost[4][5].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Review target price: **130,000 USD** per pair[3]. The **cheapest equal-or-better** alternative delivering full-range capability and transparent metrics is a system of **Neumann KH 420 ×2** (anechoic −6dB 25–22kHz, midband ripple ~2.7dB; strong SPL; very low IMD under stated conditions) plus **KH 750 ×2** subwoofers (18–750Hz)[4][5][6]. Representative US street prices: KH 420 **5,599 USD each**, KH 750 **1,999 USD each**[9][10].  
**Computation**: (5,599×2 + 1,999×2) USD ÷ 130,000 USD = **15,196 USD ÷ 130,000 USD = 0.117** → rounded to **0.1**.  
Equivalence note: the system meets or exceeds user-facing functionality (true full-range with subs) and measured transparency (neutral FR, high SPL, low distortion) at a fraction of the price[4][5][6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sonus Faber provides a **24-month** international standard warranty with registration-based extension options; support is through global authorized dealers[7][8]. The massive cabinet increases logistics burden, while the complex multi-way topology adds potential failure points. Absent large-scale failure data, we judge slightly above average overall[1][3].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Aida II prioritizes artisanal build and materials that do not necessarily scale linearly into measured transparency improvements[1]. While proprietary acoustical mechanisms are technical positives, compared with modern active systems that integrate DSP and precise directivity control, the cost-to-measured-benefit ratio appears conservative rather than aggressively rational[4][5].

## Advice

Choose Aida II if you value **craftsmanship and aesthetic presence** alongside wide-band performance, have ample space, and plan for high-current amplification given the low impedance dips noted on the preceding model[2]. If your priority is **measurement-optimized transparency per dollar**, the referenced Neumann system (or similar active + subs) offers equal-or-better audible results at dramatically lower cost[4][5][9][10].
