summary: "Heritage 2-way stand-mount that prioritizes luxury materials and a voiced response over neutrality; solid build and craft, but measured performance and amplifier load are weak versus far cheaper, more linear competitors."

## Overview

Electa Amator III is the third-generation, anniversary stand-mount in Sonus faber’s Heritage line, built from solid walnut with marble base and a 28 mm silk-dome tweeter plus 6.5-inch pulp-cone mid-woofer. It targets luxury craft and classic voicing rather than measurement-driven neutrality. Typical US street price is 12,000 USD per pair (stands often bundled or available separately). [3][4]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent lab data shows sensitivity ~87.7 dB (2.83 V/1 m) versus the 88 dB spec, but with demanding impedance/EPDR—minimum 3.3 Ω and EPDR dips to 1.6 Ω @116 Hz and 1.9 Ω @610 Hz—making it a tougher-than-average load. On-axis response exhibits a presence-band dip with rising high treble; response errors are ±5.1 dB/±5.4 dB (200 Hz–20 kHz). Bass extension is ~42 Hz (-6 dB). These figures indicate clear coloration versus neutrality norms. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Premium materials and careful cabinetry (solid walnut, marble base, refined bracing), a textile-dome tweeter with DAD, and a traditional 2-way network reflect competent, well-executed classic design. However, there’s little evidence of state-of-the-art acoustic engineering to improve linearity/directivity to modern CTA-2034 targets. [3][6]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better):** Monoprice Monolith Encore B6 (passive 2-way stand-mount). Measured on Klippel NFS with CTA-2034 data, its on-axis/listening-window linearity is markedly tighter (frequency deviation 2.7 dB over 300 Hz–5 kHz; -6 dB ~52.7 Hz) and controlled directivity; user-facing functions match. [5][6] Current market price ≈ 239.99 USD **each** (≈ 479.98 USD per pair). [7]

**CP score (defined formula):** 0.04 (cheapest equivalent-or-better ÷ target price), clamped ≤1.0. [10]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Solid timber cabinetry, simple passive topology, established global dealer support, and conventional serviceability suggest above-average longevity. The challenging impedance/EPDR may stress mismatched amplifiers over time, but there are no endemic reliability red flags in the architecture. 

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The voicing intentionally departs from neutrality (presence-band dip, rising treble), prioritizing a house sound and luxury build over transparent reproduction. From a fidelity-first stance, this is a weakly rational trade-off given the measured results and market alternatives that achieve better technical transparency at a fraction of the cost. [1]

## Advice

For accuracy-focused listening, this model is poor value and difficult to justify technically. If you admire the craftsmanship, know that you are paying primarily for materials and finish, not best-in-class measurements. Performance-driven buyers should consider pairing a neutral, well-measured stand-mount such as the Encore B6 with suitable amplification and a subwoofer; you’ll obtain higher measured fidelity and easier amplification at ~4 % of the outlay. [5][7]
