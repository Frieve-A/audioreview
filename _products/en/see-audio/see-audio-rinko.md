## Overview

The SEE Audio x Z Reviews Rinko is a hybrid IEM using a 10 mm dynamic driver and a 6 mm planar magnetic “micro planar” driver.[3] In the US market it typically sells for **99 USD**.[3] The stock cable is 0.78 mm 2-pin and ships as either a **3.5 mm** or **4.4 mm** terminated variant—**a modular plug set is not included**.[3] Tuning is broadly **V-shaped** with elevated bass and treble.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Per the manufacturer, Rinko is specified at **THD+N ≤2%**, 20 Hz–20 kHz frequency response, QA/QC tolerance **±1 dB**, 30 Ω impedance, and 112 dB±1 dB sensitivity.[3] A **≤2% THD+N** figure is relatively high for IEMs and does not inspire confidence for transparent playback. Independent lab measurements for Rinko remain limited; figures above are documented as **manufacturer specs** pending third-party verification.[3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The hybrid DD+planar recipe and 3D-printed shell are competent but not groundbreaking.[3] The 2-pin detachable cable and the option to buy either 3.5 mm or 4.4 mm terminations are practical choices, yet there is no notable technical innovation beyond the current norm.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A **more appropriate and cheaper** equivalence benchmark is the **TRUTHEAR x Crinacle ZERO (49.99 USD)**.[1][2] Functionally equivalent (wired IEM, 0.78 mm 2-pin, 3.5 mm termination), it shows **objectively superior measurements**: **FR consistency σ=0.61 dB**, **harmonic distortion 0.06% @94 dB SPL / 0.22% @104 dB SPL**, and **overall passive isolation −16.34 dB**, among others—clearly outperforming Rinko’s **manufacturer-stated THD+N ≤2%**.[2][3]  
Therefore, **CP = 49.99 USD ÷ 99 USD = 0.5**.[1][2][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Typical warranty coverage at major authorized retailers is **1 year for IEMs** and **3 months for cables/adapters**.[4][5] SEE Audio maintains multiple product releases, but long-term field reliability stats are scarce. Overall support is average for the segment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Splitting band duties across DD and planar drivers is rational, but the **≤2% THD+N** spec suggests the design optimizes excitement over transparency.[3] A V-shaped target can be enjoyable for many listeners, yet it trades off fidelity to the master.

## Advice

If you want an energetic V-shape, Rinko can be fun. If you value **measurement-driven neutrality and technical rigor**, **TRUTHEAR x Crinacle ZERO (49.99 USD)** offers **lower measured distortion and tighter consistency** at a lower price.[1][2] If you prefer a more tapered bass balance, consider the **ZERO: RED (~55 USD)** or step up to the **TRUTHEAR HEXA (79 USD)**.[1][2]
