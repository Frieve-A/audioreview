## Overview

Lizer Lab JIJUMA is a Japanese eartip series built around a metal phase-plug and venting scheme intended to shift perceived sound from “in-head” to a more frontal position. The current JIJUMA-BRASS generation is advertised with a larger tip opening and a shorter plug than earlier models, and it is sold at around 39.90 EUR before shipping in the EU and via Amazon Japan [1][2]. The company markets the concept as an “out-of-head localization eartip” and lists related patents [2][3][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

There is **no independent, controlled ABX/blind data** verifying a reliable “out-of-head” effect for JIJUMA-BRASS. One third-party post reports a ~15% increase in a clarity metric (C80) on one IEM when using a related JIJU-series tip, which suggests measurable acoustic changes but **does not establish audibility across users or programs** [9]. The third-generation description (larger phase-plug aperture, fewer shell holes) is plausibly impactful on frequency balance, yet transparent-level results for ear-coupled devices require broad, consistent measurements that are not available here [1]. Patents describe the hole/plug mechanism that aims to alter reflection timing toward the tragus, but that is still a hypothesis for localization without corroborating listening tests [3][4].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Multiple granted patents cover Lizer Lab’s ear-tip structure (phase plug, forward-firing venting) [3][4]. The current JIJUMA-BRASS iteration is documented as having a **larger plug opening and shorter overall length** versus prior versions, indicating iterative engineering and material change (brass) [1]. As an accessory-side approach to HRTF manipulation, the idea is original within eartips; however, industry adoption is limited and competing approaches (conventional geometry, foams, horn/short-stem silicones) remain more common.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**Price basis (review target):** 50 USD (approx.; EU listing 39.90 EUR before shipping) [1].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better option:** SpinFit **CP100+** silicone eartips at **13.99 USD** (2 pairs, current US retail) [5]. These provide the same user-facing functions (secure seal, broad IEM compatibility) and typical silicone-tip passive isolation suitable for music listening [5][6].  
**Calculation:** 13.99 USD ÷ 50 USD = **0.28** → rounded **0.3**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Lizer Lab is a small Japanese maker selling primarily via Amazon Japan and periodic crowdfunding; an English-language support/warranty framework is not clearly published [2][7][8]. Brass plug parts should be mechanically robust, but **long-term RMA/MTBF data are not available**. Distribution exists through EU resellers as well [1], which is positive, but after-sales expectations remain modest compared with major accessory brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design targets a real limitation of IEMs (in-head localization) using a **physically motivated** vent/plug structure described in the patents [3][4]. That is a rational hypothesis. However, emphasis on strong “front localization” outcomes without standardized listening tests or multi-unit measurements risks **over-claiming**. From a measurement-first perspective, cheaper silicone/foam tips already achieve core benefits (seal/isolation), so the premium is difficult to justify until controlled evidence shows consistent, audible superiority [6].

## Advice

Consider JIJUMA-BRASS only if you specifically want to experiment with front-localization concepts and accept uncertain outcomes. For most readers, mainstream tips like **SpinFit CP100+** (13.99 USD) or **Final Type E** (widely available, low cost) offer predictable seal, comfort, and tuning changes for far less money [5][10]. If you proceed with JIJUMA, check nozzle size compatibility (≥ Φ5.5 mm noted by an EU reseller) and anticipate import/shipping costs [1].
