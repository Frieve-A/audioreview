price: 149
summary: "Compact 1997 K’s bookshelf with point-source-oriented SS network and DDD baffle. No comprehensive third-party spinorama is available; the used market price is low, and no cheaper current speaker with equal-or-better measured performance was confirmed, so value is 1.0."

## Overview

The Kenwood LSF-777 is a late-1990s compact 2-way bookshelf from the K’s line. It features a 15 cm woofer and 2.8 cm soft-dome tweeter, an SS (Subtraction Series) crossover network, and a DDD (Diffused Diffraction Design) baffle aimed at point-source behavior[1][2]. Published figures are: 45 Hz–30 kHz, 6 Ω, 84 dB/1W/1m, 2.2 kHz crossover[1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There is **no** CTA-2034-style comprehensive third-party dataset available for the LSF-777. We therefore hold the score at the neutral **0.5** (unknown measurement) while listing key **manufacturer-published** figures for context (45 Hz–30 kHz, 84 dB/1W/1m, 6 Ω)[1][2]. This section is provisional pending credible independent measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

It’s a standard passive 2-way bass-reflex bookshelf with anti-magnetic design and engineering touches (SS network, DDD baffle)[2]. The low sensitivity (84 dB/1W/1m) implies more amplifier headroom is preferable compared with today’s higher-efficiency designs[1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Denominator (review target market price)**: the **120-day used-market average is 21,916 円**, which converts to **≈149 USD** using the ECB euro reference rates dated 2025-08-26[3][4].  
**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better current product)**: **JBL Stage A130**, a current passive 2-way with robust third-party measurements demonstrating good response/directivity[6]. The regular market price is **≈299.95 USD**[5][7].  
**Equivalence (minimal note)**: functions align (passive 2-way bookshelf), and third-party data indicate at least as good response/directivity[6].  
As of today, **no current speaker (new, regular price) was confirmed below the target’s ≈149 USD** while meeting the above **equal-or-better** criterion. Therefore CP = **1.0**[5][6][7][3][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

It is discontinued and available used only. Expect unit-to-unit variance from age-related parts (surrounds/crossover) and limited official support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The SS network (energy-sum consistency via series topology) and DDD baffle (diffraction mitigation) are **principled** directions toward point-source behavior[2]. However, absent quantitative proof of audible gains, we keep a modest score.

## Advice

Best suited for **near- to mid-field** listening at modest levels if you appreciate vintage K’s design. Due to sensitivity, pair with an amplifier providing healthy headroom[1]. Planning a path to a **well-measured current** model (e.g., JBL Stage A130) later is pragmatic[6].
