## Overview

Kenwood’s KA-NA9 is a palm-size integrated amplifier introduced in 2018 within the company’s K-Series line. It integrates a USB DAC (up to 192kHz/24-bit via PC input), optical digital input, analog mini-jack input, Bluetooth with NFC pairing, and Kenwood’s proprietary “K2 Technology” signal processing. The official product page now lists it as **discontinued** (“生産完了品”). [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

There are no independent public measurements (THD+N, SNR, IMD, frequency-response deviation, crosstalk) for the KA-NA9. Starting from the baseline (0.5) when measurements are unknown, we adjust slightly downward due to hard output limits: the spec lists **10W+10W (JEITA, 4Ω)**. With a common 8Ω speaker (assume 86 dB @ 2.83 V/1 m) and ~5 W available, peak SPL at 1 m is roughly 86 + 10·log10(5) ≈ **93 dB**; at 2 m subtract ~6 dB, add ~3 dB for stereo → around **90 dB peaks**, which restricts headroom for dynamic material in far-field listening. Near-field/desktop use remains feasible. K2 Technology is a DSP process intended to restore information lost during lossy/Bluetooth compression; while documented by the manufacturer, we found no controlled blind tests quantifying audible benefit. [2][3][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Core I/O is practical for a mini system: USB Audio Class 2.0 PC input (to 192 kHz/24-bit), optical input (PCM 32–96 kHz), and Bluetooth **4.2** supporting **SBC/AAC/aptX** (no aptX HD or LDAC). Tone controls (bass/treble) and NFC pairing are included. However, compared with current compact integrated amps, the amplifier section is very low-powered and lacks newer wireless codecs or modern conveniences like HDMI ARC. K2 Technology is a proprietary time-domain DSP upconversion/restoration approach; it is not a substitute for verifiably transparent measured performance. [2][3][4]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Comparison target (cheapest equal-or-better today):** **AIYIMA D03**. It offers **equal-or-better user functions** (USB DAC 24-bit/192 kHz, optical/coaxial/USB/RCA inputs, Bluetooth 5.0 with SBC/AAC/aptX/aptX-LL/aptX-HD, remote, sub-out) and **clearly higher output power** (manufacturer: up to 150 W ×2 into 4Ω) with low quoted THD (0.001% at 1 kHz/1 W). Current US market price we verified is **143.99 USD**. Therefore:

**CP calculation:** 143.99 USD ÷ 270 USD = **0.533…** → score rounded to **0.5**.  
(Prices and specs cited; see [5][6].)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The KA-NA9 is discontinued; official pages mark it as “生産完了品,” and long-term parts/service availability is uncertain. Build quality appears adequate (aluminum chassis; external AC adapter), but there is no field-failure data or published reliability statistics. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The physical concept—very compact integrated amp with PC USB, optical in, Bluetooth/NFC—is sensible. Yet the 10W (4Ω) ceiling constrains loudspeaker choice and listening distance, and the Bluetooth stack lacks higher-bitrate modern codecs. K2 DSP targets convenience (wireless) use cases rather than measurable transparency. Overall, design choices prioritize size and convenience over headroom and state-of-the-art wireless features. [2][3]

## Advice

Consider the KA-NA9 only for **near-field** listening with efficient speakers, where its I/O and NFC/Bluetooth convenience offset the low power. For a new purchase with similar convenience but markedly more output and codec support, the **AIYIMA D03** represents stronger value at 143.99 USD with broader inputs and substantially higher power on tap. If you need HDMI ARC, LDAC, or greater headroom, look to more recent integrated desktop amps instead. [5][6]
