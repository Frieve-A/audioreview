## Overview

The Kenwood KSC-SW11 is a compact powered car subwoofer featuring a 200x120mm driver with integrated 75W RMS Class D amplifier. Designed for under-seat installation, it provides frequency response spanning 32Hz-150Hz (specifications vary by source: Amazon lists 32Hz-120Hz, official Kenwood specifications list 35Hz-150Hz) with variable low-pass crossover (50-125Hz) and phase control. The product has been discontinued by the manufacturer, limiting ongoing support and availability to remaining stock from various retailers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Frequency response spans 32Hz-150Hz with some source variation (Amazon: 32Hz-120Hz, Kenwood official: 35Hz-150Hz), appropriate for subwoofer application with reasonable extension [1]. 75W RMS power output adequate for compact installation requirements with 150W peak capability. 110 dB in-car sensitivity represents reasonable efficiency for the application. However, no detailed THD, SNR, or distortion measurements are publicly available from independent testing laboratories. Without comprehensive measurement data including harmonic distortion, intermodulation distortion, and detailed frequency response deviation measurements, evaluation defaults to baseline per framework guidelines for products with limited measurement transparency.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Uses appropriate Class D amplifier technology representing contemporary standard approach. Design lacks proprietary innovations or advanced features, relying on standard industry implementation without technical differentiation. Basic analog integration with conventional crossover and phase controls, wired remote control system. No evidence of cutting-edge technology adoption, advanced DSP integration, or proprietary technical expertise. Technical specifications easily matched by competing products without significant barriers to replication.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Rockville RW8CA selected as equivalent-or-better comparison target. Equipped with 150W RMS Class D amplifier, compact under-seat design, variable crossover, phase control, and auto turn-on technology - equivalent core functions with superior power output suitable for same application.

Current market price for KSC-SW11 approximately 150 USD from remaining stock retailers, while Rockville RW8CA available for 130 USD with installation kit. CP = 130 USD รท 150 USD = 0.87, rounded to 0.9 [1][2].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Simple Class D amplifier design with sealed enclosure provides inherent reliability through robust construction with minimal moving components. However, 1-year warranty period below industry standard. Product discontinuation eliminates ongoing manufacturer support and parts availability. Support infrastructure limited to contracted third-party service centers for out-of-warranty repairs, with potential parts unavailability [3]. Limited service response options reduce long-term reliability prospects despite inherently durable design.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Design demonstrates rational engineering approach using measurement-based Class D amplifier technology with appropriate frequency response targeting for compact car audio application. Cost allocation reasonable for intended installation constraints and power requirements. Uses contemporary amplification technology without non-scientific claims or inefficient design choices. Design prioritizes practical installation requirements over maximum performance, representing sound engineering approach for specific use case constraints without evidence of occult audio approaches or scientifically questionable claims.

## Advice

Consider current alternatives before purchasing remaining stock. Rockville RW8CA offers superior power output (150W vs 75W RMS) at lower cost with ongoing manufacturer support. For new installations, evaluate actively supported products with warranty coverage and manufacturer support rather than discontinued models with limited service infrastructure and inconsistent pricing.
