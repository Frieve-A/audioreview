## Overview

The QDC Hybrid Fusion-S represents the company's flagship hybrid in-ear monitor featuring a 4 balanced armature + 1 dynamic driver configuration. Developed by Shenzhen Qili Audio, a company with military communication technology background, the Fusion-S incorporates proprietary acoustic cavity technology and 3-way crossover design. Originally inspired by jazz music, this hybrid IEM targets monitor and music enthusiasts with its multi-plug system supporting 3.5mm, 2.5mm, and 4.4mm connectivity. The product includes comprehensive accessories and aims to deliver flat frequency characteristics through QDC's independent acoustic cavity implementation, addressing traditional hybrid driver integration challenges.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The QDC Hybrid Fusion-S presents limited measurable performance data for comprehensive scientific evaluation. Available manufacturer specifications indicate 106 dB SPL/mW sensitivity (adequate for most sources), 18Ω impedance, and 26 dB passive noise isolation (between problematic 10dB and excellent 30dB levels). Frequency response specification lists 10Hz-20kHz range without deviation measurements from neutral targets. Critical performance metrics including THD, S/N ratio, and measured frequency response deviation from Harman target curve remain unavailable from credible third-party sources for the Fusion-S specifically. While Crinacle's database contains measurements for the standard QDC Fusion model, these cannot be applied to the Fusion-S due to potential design differences between variants. Without independent verification of claimed "flat characteristics" through measurement data specific to the Fusion-S, scientific validity cannot be properly assessed beyond manufacturer claims. When credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 as per evaluation guidelines.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

QDC demonstrates significant technical sophistication through proprietary independent acoustic cavity and acoustic channel technology addressing hybrid driver integration challenges. The 3-way crossover with 4 BA + 1 dynamic driver configuration represents advanced multi-driver implementation requiring substantial engineering knowledge. Company background in military communication technology transfer provides legitimate technical foundation, supported by professional R&D facilities including B&K testing instruments and electroacoustics expertise. In-house design ownership and proprietary patent technology adoption contribute to competitive technical positioning. However, multi-BA driver technology represents established rather than cutting-edge approaches, limiting technology advancement evaluation. Technical integration demonstrates appropriate analog component combination without advanced digital/software features.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The QDC Hybrid Fusion-S at 800 USD demonstrates poor cost-performance against equivalent alternatives. The Moondrop Chu II at 20 USD provides equivalent-or-better functionality with single dynamic driver configuration, 119 dB/Vrms sensitivity (versus QDC's 106 dB SPL/mW which converts to approximately 118.6 dB/Vrms), wider effective frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz versus 10Hz-20kHz, and equivalent 18Ω impedance. Both feature detachable 2-pin cable connectivity and provide full-range audio reproduction capabilities.

CP = 20 USD ÷ 800 USD = 0.025

The calculation demonstrates that equivalent performance and functionality can be obtained for approximately 2.5% of the Fusion-S price, indicating extremely poor cost-performance positioning in the IEM market.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

QDC provides standard 1-year limited warranty coverage with manufacturer support through authorized dealer networks [8]. The warranty covers defects in parts or workmanship for 12 months from purchase date, with maintenance charges applying after the warranty period [7]. Complex multi-driver configuration inherently increases failure probability compared to single-driver designs due to additional component count. Manufacturing location in mainland China may impact parts procurement and repair response times compared to Western manufacturers [9]. Standard warranty period without extended coverage options limits long-term support value. Some authorized retailers offer extended warranty coverage, with select dealers providing up to two-year warranty periods [10].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

QDC's design philosophy demonstrates mixed rational and questionable elements. Positive aspects include measurement-focused approach using B&K professional equipment, electroacoustics R&D team expertise, and technical foundation from military communication technology transfer. The hybrid BA+DD approach for frequency band division represents technically sound engineering principles. However, cost-effectiveness rationality suffers significantly, with pricing structure failing to deliver proportional performance improvements over much cheaper alternatives. Jazz-inspired tuning philosophy lacks scientific basis compared to measurement-driven approaches. The company appropriately avoids problematic audiophile myths while maintaining focus on measurable performance parameters. Technology investment direction shows rational acoustic engineering but questionable economic positioning relative to market alternatives achieving equivalent functionality at substantially lower costs.

## Advice

The QDC Hybrid Fusion-S cannot be recommended due to extremely poor cost-performance ratio. Despite legitimate technical sophistication and proprietary acoustic technologies, the 800 USD price point lacks justification when equivalent performance is available for approximately 20 USD through alternatives like the Moondrop Chu II. Quality control concerns including connector durability issues further diminish value proposition. Potential purchasers should consider budget alternatives offering equivalent or superior measured performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness, including the Moondrop Chu II (20 USD), 7Hz Salnotes Zero 2 (25 USD), or the Truthear Hexa (79 USD) for hybrid configuration, all of which provide excellent performance at a fraction of the cost. Only buyers specifically requiring QDC's proprietary acoustic implementation or brand preference should consider this product, understanding the substantial price premium provides minimal measurable benefit over market alternatives. Investment of 800 USD would be better allocated toward higher-performing products or multiple budget alternatives for various use cases.
