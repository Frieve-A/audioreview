## Overview

QDC Uranus is a hybrid in-ear monitor featuring 1DD+1BA driver configuration retailing at 219 USD. QDC, a Chinese IEM manufacturer established with 10 years of police and military products research technology background, positions this model as an affordable flagship offering. The Uranus combines a custom 10mm composite diaphragm dynamic driver with a balanced armature driver through a 2-way crossover system, housed in translucent resin shells with aluminum alloy nozzles.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity evaluation cannot be properly assessed due to insufficient measurement data. While third-party frequency response measurements from Crinacle and AudioDiscourse show sharp rise at 800Hz in upper midrange with elevated upper-bass and recessed mid-range characteristics [1][2], comprehensive performance data for THD, S/N ratio, dynamic range, IMD, and crosstalk remains unavailable. Without complete measurement verification of key audibility indicators, Scientific Validity must be set to 0.5 as per policy for products where insufficient data prevents proper evaluation. Available frequency response data suggests irregularities affecting transparency, but lacks scope for comprehensive assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The QDC Uranus employs conventional hybrid driver technology representing standard industry implementation. While QDC claims patented acoustic design with 2-way crossover and custom composite diaphragm, the overall approach utilizes mature technology widely adopted across the industry. The 1DD+1BA configuration offers adequate technical implementation without significant innovation or differentiation from competitors. The analog-only approach lacks integration of modern DSP, software, or advanced digital processing capabilities that could enhance functionality. Construction quality appears adequate with resin shells and aluminum nozzles, representing appropriate but conventional engineering without breakthrough innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

This item is evaluated mechanically by ignoring construction and price tiers, selecting the cheapest product that is equivalent-or-better in user-facing functions (passive wired IEM) and in publicly measured frequency response. Truthear Hola has publicly available FR measurements and shows smaller irregularities in upper mid to treble compared with Uranus third-party FR datasets, thus judged equivalent-or-better for this purpose [6]. With a lowest market price example of 19 USD confirmed [7], CP = 19 USD ÷ 219 USD = 0.1 (after rounding). This comparison is based on currently available measurements and market prices and will be updated when more comprehensive measurements become available.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

QDC provides 12-month warranty coverage for defects in parts or workmanship, below the industry standard 2-year period [4]. Standard exclusions apply for unauthorized repairs, liquid damage, and appearance wear. Support infrastructure relies primarily on dealer networks rather than direct manufacturer service. Construction employs resin shells with aluminum nozzles, representing adequate but unremarkable durability for the price category. No specific reliability data or failure rate information is publicly available, and the company's track record, while established, lacks comprehensive longevity documentation for this specific model.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

QDC demonstrates reasonable design philosophy centered on collaboration with professional musicians and sound engineers for tuning optimization [5]. The company emphasizes wide frequency response, minimal coloration, and accurate soundstage positioning as core objectives. While this musician-focused approach shows merit, the execution remains conservative without embracing modern measurement-focused methodologies or cost-optimization strategies. The design philosophy avoids questionable audiophile claims while maintaining traditional analog-only implementation. Resource allocation toward driver quality and tuning appears appropriate, though the absence of innovative technologies or significant cost reduction efforts limits overall rationality assessment.

## Advice

The QDC Uranus represents a competently executed but unremarkable entry in the crowded hybrid IEM market. At 219 USD, potential buyers should carefully consider alternatives like the Leteciel Magiris at 159 USD offering similar driver configuration and superior catalog specifications. The Uranus may appeal to users specifically seeking QDC's house sound signature or those prioritizing the included premium leather case and GE4C cable. However, the lack of distinctive technical advantages, limited measurement verification, and modest cost-performance ratio suggests exploring competitive offerings before purchase. Users requiring comprehensive measurement verification should await independent testing results before making purchasing decisions.
