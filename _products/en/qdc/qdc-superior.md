## Overview

The qdc Superior is an in-ear monitor featuring a single dynamic driver, manufactured by the Chinese company qdc. It employs a 10mm full-range dynamic driver and claims resonance suppression through its 3D-printed housing and metal nozzle. Positioned as an entry-level product utilizing qdc's technical expertise, it is sold in the Japanese market for 12,870 JPY. Note that the higher-tier model, the Superior EX, which features an aluminum housing, is a separate product developed in collaboration with FitEar.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While the frequency response claims a wide bandwidth of 10Hz-40kHz, actual measurement data shows approximately ±3dB deviation within the 20Hz-20kHz audible range. The sensitivity of 100dB SPL/mW is at a standard level, and the 16Ω impedance allows it to be driven by smartphones. The 26dB isolation performance is standard for single dynamic driver IEMs. A lack of publicly available measurement data for THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) makes it impossible to verify transparent-level fidelity to the master source. Compared to competing products in the same price range, there is no clear superiority in measured performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The combination of a 10mm dynamic driver and a 3D-printed housing is a common design approach in modern IEMs. As a product independently developed by qdc, its technical originality and innovation are limited. The driver design, 3D-printed housing manufacturing, and tuning technology are all within the industry standard level. Compared to other brands' products in a similar price range, it lacks technical differentiation, and there is no disclosure of patented technologies or unique designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Compared to the qdc Superior (12,870 JPY), there is the Moondrop Chu II (3,000 JPY), which offers equivalent or superior single dynamic driver performance. The calculation is: 3,000 JPY ÷ 12,870 JPY = 0.23, resulting in a score of 0.2. The Chu II shows equivalent or better measured values in frequency response, sensitivity, and impedance, with no functional disadvantages. Furthermore, other options like the DUNU Titan S (12,000 JPY) and Simgot EA500 (11,850 JPY) provide higher performance at a similar price point. Excluding brand value, the performance-to-price ratio must be evaluated as remarkably low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a product from qdc, a Chinese manufacturer with experience in professional audio equipment, basic reliability can be expected. However, detailed information about warranty terms, repair systems, and long-term support is limited. The company's track record in the consumer market is shorter compared to established Western brands, and there is insufficient data on product lifespan and failure rates. While the build quality appears solid, the level of customer support and after-sales service remains unclear, making it difficult to evaluate reliability and support at a high level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The direction toward natural sound reproduction through a single dynamic driver is rational. As a product independently developed by qdc, technical consistency and a unified design philosophy are maintained. Resonance suppression through its 3D-printed housing and metal nozzle represents a practical approach that contributes to measurement performance improvement. While pricing is higher compared to competing products, it remains within an understandable range considering brand value and quality control systems. The technical direction is based on scientific evidence, demonstrating a rational development approach that does not depend on audio mythology.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the qdc Superior, we recommend evaluating lower-priced alternatives with equivalent or superior performance. Particularly, the Moondrop Chu II (3,000 JPY) offers equivalent or superior measurement performance, build quality, and accessories while being available at approximately one-quarter the price. For those with higher budgets, options like the DUNU Titan S (12,000 JPY) and Simgot EA500 (11,850 JPY) provide higher performance at similar prices to the Superior. While it may be an option for those with loyalty to the qdc brand or those who appreciate the technical capabilities of Chinese manufacturers, superior alternatives exist for users prioritizing pure cost-performance.
