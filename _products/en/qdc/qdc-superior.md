summary: "Single dynamic driver IEM by qdc. While measurement performance is standard, low cost-performance due to pricing approximately 4 times higher than equivalent products."

## Overview

The qdc Superior is an in-ear monitor featuring a single dynamic driver, manufactured by the Chinese company qdc. It employs a 10mm full-range dynamic driver and claims resonance suppression through its aluminum housing. Positioned as a product utilizing qdc's technical expertise, it is sold in the Japanese market for 12,870 JPY. Note that the superior model Superior EX is separately developed as a collaboration with FitEar.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While the frequency response claims a wide bandwidth of 10Hz-40kHz, actual measurement data shows approximately ±3dB deviation within the 20Hz-20kHz range. The sensitivity of 100dB SPL/mW is at a standard level, and the 16Ω impedance allows driving from smartphones. The 26dB isolation performance is standard for single dynamic driver IEMs. Published measurement data for THD and SNR values is lacking, making it impossible to confirm achievement of transparency levels. No clear performance advantages are observed compared to competing products in the same price range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The combination of a 10mm dynamic driver and aluminum housing represents conventional design methodology. As a product developed independently by qdc, technical uniqueness and innovation are limited. Driver design, housing machining, and tuning technologies all fall within industry standard levels. Compared to Chinese IEM brands in the equivalent price range, differentiation elements are scarce, with no disclosure of patented technologies or proprietary designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Against the qdc Superior (12,870 JPY), the Moondrop Chu II (3,000 JPY) exists with equivalent or superior single dynamic driver performance. Calculation: 3,000 JPY ÷ 12,870 JPY = 0.23, resulting in a 0.2 evaluation. The Chu II demonstrates equivalent or superior measurement values in frequency response, sensitivity, and impedance, with no inferior user-facing features. Additionally, multiple higher-performing and lower-priced options exist, such as the DUNU Titan S (12,000 JPY) and Simgot EA500 (11,850 JPY). Excluding brand value, the performance-to-price ratio is inferior.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

qdc maintains a certain track record as an established Chinese IEM manufacturer and ensures its own quality control system. The warranty period is a standard one year, with repair support provided through domestic distributors. However, clear information disclosure regarding parts replacement pricing and repair periods is insufficient. Product failure rate data and MTBF values are not published, making objective comparison with competing products difficult.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The direction toward natural sound reproduction through a single dynamic driver is rational. As a product independently developed by qdc, technical consistency and unified design philosophy are maintained. Resonance suppression through the aluminum housing represents a practical approach that contributes to measurement performance improvement. While pricing is higher compared to competing products, it remains within an understandable range considering brand value and quality control systems. The technical direction is based on scientific evidence, demonstrating a rational development approach that does not depend on audio mythology.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the qdc Superior, we recommend evaluating lower-priced alternatives with equivalent or superior performance. Particularly, the Moondrop Chu II (3,000 JPY) offers equivalent or superior measurement performance, build quality, and accessories while being available at approximately one-quarter the price. For those with higher budgets, options like the DUNU Titan S (12,000 JPY) and Simgot EA500 (11,850 JPY) provide higher performance at similar prices to the Superior. While it may be an option for those with loyalty to the qdc brand or those who appreciate Chinese manufacturer technical capabilities, superior alternatives exist for users prioritizing pure cost-performance.
