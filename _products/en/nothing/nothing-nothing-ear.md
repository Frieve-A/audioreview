## Overview

Nothing Ear is the 4th generation true wireless earphones from Nothing, a company founded by Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus. Featuring a transparent design case and 11mm ceramic diaphragm drivers, it supports high-quality codecs like LDAC and LHDC, along with active noise cancellation. Notable software features include a proprietary Personal Sound Profile function and an Advanced Equalizer (parametric EQ) available through the Nothing X app.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Nothing Ear's measurement performance is at a standard level. Its ANC performance achieves up to 45dB of noise reduction, which is an excellent performance exceeding the 40dB ideal standard in our review policy. The frequency response covers 20Hz to 20kHz with a warm tendency but does not achieve flatness within Â±3dB. While THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) performance is rated as "very low," specific figures below 0.01% cannot be confirmed from available measurements. Although LDAC/LHDC support enables high-quality source playback, the acoustic performance of the drivers themselves shows no significant advantage over the latest premium earphones.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption of 11mm ceramic diaphragm drivers and comprehensive codec support via Bluetooth 5.3 (SBC, AAC, LDAC, LHDC) demonstrates a modern approach. The implementation of a Personal Sound Profile function and an Advanced Equalizer (parametric EQ with Q-factor and frequency control) through the Nothing X app are commendable technical features, offering greater customization than standard graphic EQs in competitors. However, these technologies are a combination of established existing methods, with limited innovative proprietary technology development. The ANC technology also remains a standard industry implementation and does not reach cutting-edge levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 149 USD (approx. 23,000 JPY), Nothing Ear provides a unique combination of features including parametric EQ, Personal Sound Profile, and LHDC codec support. While more affordable options like the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC (approx. 99 USD) offer comparable ANC and LDAC support, they lack the advanced parametric EQ and LHDC, making them not fully equivalent. No cheaper alternative with the same or superior functionality and performance exists, resulting in a cost-performance score of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Nothing is a relatively new company with limited long-term reliability data. The IP54 rating for the earbuds and IP55 for the case provide a standard level of water and dust resistance, sufficient for normal use. The warranty period and repair system are presumed to be industry-average, but the company lacks the long-term support track record of established audio manufacturers. Firmware updates are provided through the Nothing X app, with a structure that allows for future functional improvements.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The approach of emphasizing design uniqueness and user customization features like the Personal Sound Profile and parametric EQ is rational. The focus on optimizing sound quality through software within the constraints of a true wireless earphone format is commendable. However, this remains within the scope of combining existing technologies and does not introduce any revolutionary breakthroughs in acoustic performance itself. It can be described as a product that prioritizes a balance of functionality, design, and sound quality.

## Advice

The Nothing Ear is a product that offers excellent ANC performance, advanced sound customization via parametric EQ and Personal Sound Profile, and comprehensive codec support at the 149 USD price point. It is particularly suitable for users who value detailed EQ adjustments, personalized tuning based on hearing tests, and the unique Nothing design. While alternatives like the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC provide strong ANC and battery life at a lower price, they do not match the advanced EQ capabilities or LHDC support. If these features are essential, Nothing Ear justifies its price; otherwise, compare carefully for cost savings.
