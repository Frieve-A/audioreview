summary: "Nothing Ear offers excellent 45dB ANC performance and advanced EQ functions for 149 USD, but its cost-performance is limited by the existence of more affordable alternatives like the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC. Its measurement performance is standard, making it an option for users who prioritize functionality."

## Overview

Nothing Ear is the 4th generation true wireless earphones from Nothing, a company founded by Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus. Featuring a transparent design case and 11mm ceramic diaphragm drivers, it supports high-quality codecs like LDAC and LHDC, along with active noise cancellation. Notable software features include a proprietary Personal Sound Profile function and an Advanced Equalizer (parametric EQ) available through the Nothing X app.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Nothing Ear's measurement performance is at a standard level. Its ANC performance achieves up to 45dB of noise reduction, which is an excellent performance exceeding the 40dB ideal standard in our review policy. The frequency response covers 20Hz to 20kHz with a warm tendency but does not achieve flatness within ±3dB. While THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) performance is rated as "very low," it cannot be confirmed if the specific figures reach the transparent level of below 0.01%. Although LDAC/LHDC support enables high-quality source playback, the acoustic performance of the drivers themselves shows no significant advantage over the latest premium earphones.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of 11mm ceramic diaphragm drivers and comprehensive codec support via Bluetooth 5.3 (SBC, AAC, LDAC, LHDC) demonstrates a modern approach. The implementation of a Personal Sound Profile function and an Advanced Equalizer (parametric EQ with Q-factor and frequency control) through the Nothing X app are commendable technical features. However, these technologies are a combination of established existing methods, with limited innovative proprietary technology development. The ANC technology also remains a standard industry implementation and does not reach cutting-edge levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For the 149 USD (approx. 23,800 JPY) Nothing Ear, more affordable alternatives with equivalent or superior functionality exist. The Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, available for under 100 USD (approx. 12,990 JPY), offers an LDAC codec, comparable or superior ANC, and app-based EQ, providing technically equivalent or better performance. The calculation based on Japanese market prices is: 12,990 JPY ÷ 23,800 JPY ≈ 0.55, which rounds to 0.5. Since both products feature basic functionalities like 11mm drivers, comparable ANC, and LDAC support, the existence of a more affordable alternative results in a cost-performance score of 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Nothing is a relatively new company with limited long-term reliability data. The IP54 rating for the earbuds and IP55 for the case provide a standard level of water and dust resistance, sufficient for normal use. The warranty period and repair system are presumed to be industry-average, but the company lacks the long-term support track record of established audio manufacturers. Firmware updates are provided through the Nothing X app, with a structure that allows for future functional improvements.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The approach of emphasizing design uniqueness and user customization features like the Personal Sound Profile and parametric EQ is rational. The focus on optimizing sound quality through software within the constraints of a true wireless earphone format is commendable. However, this remains within the scope of combining existing technologies and does not introduce any revolutionary breakthroughs in acoustic performance itself. It can be described as a product that prioritizes a balance of functionality, design, and sound quality.

## Advice

The Nothing Ear is a product that offers excellent ANC performance and a comprehensive feature set at the 149 USD price point. It is particularly suitable for users who value the detailed sound customization offered by the parametric EQ, the Personal Sound Profile, and the unique Nothing design. However, if pure cost-performance is the top priority, more affordable products with comparable or better performance, such as the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, are strong alternatives. We recommend a careful comparison to determine if these additional features justify the price difference before making a purchase.
