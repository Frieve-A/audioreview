## Overview

Nothing Ear (a) is the company’s budget-minded TWS launched in April 2024 at 99 USD. It retains the transparent design while focusing on core utility: Hi-Res Audio (LDAC), active noise cancelling (manufacturer claim up to 45 dB), multipoint, and a rated 42.5-hour total battery life. The earbuds are IP54-rated (case IPX2). These features are confirmed by official specs and third-party lab testing. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent lab measurements show generally flat-tilted tuning with modest bass lift and controlled mids. RTINGS measured **overall ANC/isolation attenuation of −18.00 dB** (bass −14.31 dB / mid −19.28 dB / treble −21.07 dB). Weighted harmonic distortion is low (**WHD @ 90 dB: 0.251; @ 100 dB: 0.217**), and **weighted group delay** sits **below the audibility threshold**, indicating tight bass timing. Treble shows three peaks that can make cymbals sound piercing on some tracks and may warrant mild EQ. These data support meaningful, audible improvements versus no-ANC listening without over-claiming transparency. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Ear (a) uses a conventional dynamic driver with Bluetooth 5.3, LDAC, multipoint, and adaptive ANC modes (High/Medium/Low/Adaptive). The stack is competent and modern for mid-tier TWS but not pioneering; no novel transducer or processing beyond category norms. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

To judge CP, we searched for the **cheapest product with equal or better user-facing functions (ANC + LDAC + multipoint) and equal-or-better measured isolation**. The **Anker Soundcore Space A40** qualifies (LDAC, multipoint, and **stronger measured full-range isolation: −23.54 dB**), but its **general retail price is 99.99 USD** on the official store as of the review date—**not cheaper than 99 USD**. Likewise, Anker **Liberty 4 NC** (LDAC, multipoint, **−20.94 dB** isolation) is 99.99 USD. Therefore, we did not find a cheaper equivalent-or-better option at general retail; **CP is 1.0**. [3][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Long-term field reliability is still maturing for a 2024 model. Official specs provide IP54 for buds (case IPX2), firmware-updatable features via the Nothing X app, and standard warranty coverage. No large-scale durability dataset exists yet. [1][2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing broadly neutral tuning, effective ANC, and LDAC/multipoint at an accessible price reflects rational trade-offs. The design avoids exotic materials while delivering measured performance that matters audibly (low WHD, acceptable isolation), aligning with evidence-based value rather than marketing flourish. [1][2]

## Advice

Ear (a) fits commuters and everyday listeners who want measured-good isolation, LDAC, and a stable fit at 99 USD. If you specifically want **maximum** ANC effectiveness at this price, note that Anker’s **Space A40** measures stronger isolation, though it typically doesn’t undercut Ear (a) on price at general retail. Treble-sensitive users may prefer a slight EQ dip around the measured peak regions.
