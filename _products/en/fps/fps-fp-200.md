## Overview

The FPS FP-200 outdoor speaker represents a specialized application of FPS Inc.'s proprietary MCMA (Multi Cell Microtransducer Array) flat panel technology for outdoor public address systems. Manufactured by the Japanese company FPS Inc., the FP-200 features two MCMA flat speaker units (FPS1010M3R4 with 100 cells each) custom developed for station use, housed in a weather-resistant enclosure with IPX5 waterproof rating. Available in single-sided (FP-200HB) and double-sided (FP-200HW) configurations, the speaker offers multiple impedance options (500Ω to 2kΩ) for professional PA system integration. The ultra-thin design (60-169.5mm depth) and directional characteristics (160° vertical, 40° horizontal) position it for specific outdoor announcement applications where conventional horn speakers may prove unsuitable.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Scientific Validity evaluation for this specialized PA speaker shows average performance within its intended usage band. The FP-200's frequency range of 330Hz-12kHz meets standard requirements for outdoor public address applications, where speech intelligibility and announcement clarity take priority over full-range music reproduction. For speaker-specific criteria, the frequency response appears adequate within its usage band, though no deviation measurements (±dB specifications) are provided to assess true performance quality. The 91 dB/W/m efficiency represents sufficient output for PA applications. Critical measurement data including THD, S/N ratio, IMD specifications remain unavailable from manufacturer sources, preventing comprehensive performance assessment across all speaker evaluation criteria. Third-party community feedback indicates "low efficiency" and "limited volume capability" which aligns with specialized application constraints rather than fundamental design flaws [4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Cost-Performance evaluation cannot be accurately calculated due to unavailable verified market pricing for the FP-200. Estimated market pricing for the FP-200 is approximately 40,000円 (400 USD) for single-sided (FP-200HB) and 50,000円 (500 USD) for double-sided (FP-200HW) models (as of 2025-10-24, tax-inclusive estimates). These estimates are derived from domestic outdoor PA speaker retail price ranges for equivalent specifications (100V line/weatherproof/15-60W class). The FP-200's 20W, IPX5 equivalent, station-use specifications place it in the mid-range category, comparable to TOA outdoor speakers (15W at 31,600円 tax-exclusive, 60W at 85,500円 tax-exclusive, equating to approximately 35,000円 to 94,000円 tax-inclusive). However, without confirmed pricing data, a baseline score of 0.5 is assigned pending availability of verified market information. For comparison context, equivalent outdoor weatherproof speakers such as the Power Dynamics CH300 Horn Loudspeaker are available at 27 USD (£22.00) [5]. The CH300 provides equivalent outdoor weatherproofing (IPX6 vs IPX5), 30W power handling, 8-ohm impedance, and suitability for PA applications. The FP-200's specialized flat panel technology and ultra-thin form factor represent unique functional advantages for architectural integration applications where conventional horn speakers prove unsuitable. However, quantitative cost-performance analysis requires verified pricing information to establish meaningful comparison ratios. The specialized MCMA technology and custom station-use development suggest premium positioning relative to conventional alternatives, but specific value assessment awaits confirmed market pricing data from official sources.
