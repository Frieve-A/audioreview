## Overview

The FPS FB-6002 represents FPS Inc's flagship outdoor flat panel speaker utilizing proprietary MCMA (Multi Cell Microtransducer Array) technology. Available in four models (LB/LW/HB/HW) with varying impedance and power configurations, this speaker targets commercial installations including digital signage and railway station announcements. The ultra-slim 90mm profile houses 600 cells across two FPS2030M3P1R units, delivering directional sound with claimed weather resistance from -20°C to 220°C. While innovative in design approach, the severely limited 250Hz-10kHz frequency range significantly restricts audio reproduction compared to conventional outdoor speakers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The FB-6002's audio performance is fundamentally limited by its severely restricted frequency range of 250Hz-10kHz (-10dB), placing it well below standard 20Hz-20kHz audio reproduction quality [1]. This narrow range excludes critical low frequencies below 250Hz and high frequencies above 10kHz essential for natural sound reproduction. Critical missing measurements include THD, SNR, dynamic range, IMD, and crosstalk data, preventing comprehensive performance evaluation. While the 91dB/W/m sensitivity and 250W power handling (low impedance models) appear adequate, the narrow frequency response represents a fundamental limitation for quality audio reproduction. The highly directional characteristics (70° vertical, 20° horizontal) serve specific applications but further constrain general audio use.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The FB-6002 demonstrates moderate technological achievement through its proprietary MCMA technology. The Multi Cell Microtransducer Array represents genuine innovation in flat panel speaker design, utilizing liquid crystal polymer vibration films across 600 cells to create planar wave generation [2]. This in-house developed technology shows technical sophistication and accumulated expertise in specialized applications. However, the design remains primarily analog/mechanical without integration of modern DSP, software, or AI technologies that characterize cutting-edge audio products. While the multi-cell concept provides differentiation in the flat panel category, broader technological appeal remains limited compared to contemporary audio innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The FB-6002 is estimated at approximately 4,000 USD (single-sided models LB/HB) to 5,700 USD (dual-sided models LW/HW), but cost-performance evaluation is difficult due to the lack of official pricing information. While the estimated pricing is based on market analysis of FPS2030 transducer market conditions (used pairs at approximately 270 USD), including new B2B procurement, outdoor housing, weatherproof finishing, and installation project margins, the opacity of official pricing makes accurate comparative evaluation impossible. While superior alternatives exist including the JBL AWC82 (USD 503) offering 80Hz-20kHz frequency response with equivalent 250W power handling and IP56 weatherproof rating [3], and the Definitive Technology AW6500 providing 40Hz-30kHz range with 200W capacity [4], direct price comparison remains difficult due to pricing information opacity.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The FB-6002 demonstrates strong construction quality with claimed excellent durability and weatherproof materials enabling outdoor operation across extreme temperature ranges (-20°C to 220°C) [5]. The flat panel design inherently reduces mechanical failure points compared to cone speakers, while the reported 99.5% recyclability indicates sustainable construction. FPS claims their speakers typically outlast amplifiers and digital components, supported by actual deployment in demanding Japanese railway station environments. However, warranty information and global support infrastructure details remain limited, with the company primarily based in Gifu, Japan. Standard amplifier and cable compatibility reduces support complexity for installations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

FPS demonstrates rational design philosophy for specific commercial applications requiring space constraints, weather resistance, and directional sound control. The multi-cell concept with pixel analogy shows systematic innovation thinking, while the flat panel design directly supports installation requirements and potentially reduces material costs [6]. The 99.5% recyclability and extreme weather tolerance address practical deployment needs. However, the design philosophy shows inconsistency between claimed high-fidelity reproduction capabilities and the severely limited 250Hz-10kHz frequency range. Claims about reproducing "subtle sound details like fingers during contact of guitar strings" appear scientifically questionable given the narrow frequency response that excludes fundamental frequencies for many instruments.

## Advice

The FB-6002 serves specialized commercial applications requiring directional sound, extreme weather resistance, and space-constrained installations. Potential applications include digital signage audio, public announcement systems, and architectural integration where conventional speakers prove impractical. However, avoid this speaker for music reproduction or general audio applications due to the severely limited 250Hz-10kHz frequency range that excludes critical low and high frequencies. For outdoor music applications, consider conventional weatherproof speakers like the JBL AWC82 or Definitive Technology AW6500 offering full-range frequency response. When evaluating, ensure specific directional requirements justify the significant frequency limitations, and budget for potential subwoofer integration if bass response becomes necessary for intended applications.
