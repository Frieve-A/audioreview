## Overview

The Aiyima A70 is a Class D stereo amplifier employing the Texas Instruments TPA3255 chip. It claims a maximum output of 300W×2 (4Ω) and features Post Filter Feedback (PFFB) technology to eliminate load dependency and improve linearity. Equipped with XLR and RCA inputs plus trigger input functionality, it's designed as a compact desktop amplifier. The unit incorporates an NE5532 op-amp with swappable design providing flexibility for sound tuning.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio Science Review measurements show 96dB SINAD when using XLR input with 48V 10A power supply, classified in the "excellent" category. SNR reaches 116dB with THD at 0.0015% at 1W, demonstrating superior specifications. Frequency response covers 20Hz-20kHz (±1dB), nearly completely covering the audible range. PFFB technology eliminates load dependency, achieving performance close to the transparent level in the measurement criteria table. However, this peak performance is only achieved with XLR input and 48V 10A power supply combination, with degraded performance when using RCA input.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design combining TPA3255 chip with PFFB technology is technically sound. High-quality components include Sumida audio inductors, NCC large-capacity filter capacitors, German WIMA output capacitors, and Japanese ELNA electrolytic capacitors. The op-amp swapping feature providing sound tuning flexibility is also commendable. However, TPA3255 itself is already widely used existing technology, and PFFB implementation is not particularly innovative. This represents industry-standard technology with proper implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Against the 170-189 USD price point, Fosi Audio V3 offers similar functionality at 129 USD. V3 also uses the same TPA3255 chip, achieving 88dB SINAD in stereo version with op-amp swapping capability. Calculation: 129 USD ÷ 175 USD = 0.737. However, A70 demonstrates 96dB SINAD (with XLR + 48V 10A power supply) exceeding V3 stereo version's 88dB, and considering this performance difference, the price differential has some rationality. While cheaper alternatives with equivalent functionality exist, it maintains superiority in peak measurement performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Aiyima has established market presence as a Chinese audio brand, but long-term reliability data is limited. Product warranty is at industry standard level, while global support infrastructure is inferior compared to major manufacturers. Due to Class D technology characteristics, failure rates are expected to be relatively low, but lacks proven track record for long-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy is scientifically rational with Class D technology adoption, PFFB implementation for linearity improvement, and high-quality component usage. Development direction contributes to measurable sound quality improvements while eliminating unscientific claims. Practical design elements like XLR/RCA dual compatibility and trigger input functionality are also commendable. Appropriate thermal design within compact chassis is rational.

## Advice

The A70 is an excellent amplifier in terms of measurement performance, achieving 96dB SINAD with XLR input and 48V 10A power supply, exceeding Fosi Audio V3 stereo version's 88dB. However, it's inferior in price-to-performance ratio compared to competitors, with V3 providing sufficient performance for many applications. It offers value when seeking highest measurement performance standards and can construct XLR input environment, but for typical music listening using RCA input, the more affordable V3 provides adequate performance. Recommended only when there are clear requirements for measurement performance.
