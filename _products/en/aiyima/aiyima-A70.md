## Overview

The AIYIMA A70 is a Class D stereo amplifier employing the Texas Instruments TPA3255 chip. It claims a maximum output of 300W×2 (4Ω) and features Post Filter Feedback (PFFB) technology to eliminate load dependency and improve linearity. Equipped with XLR and RCA inputs plus trigger input functionality, it's designed as a compact desktop amplifier. The unit incorporates an NE5532 op-amp with swappable design providing flexibility for sound tuning.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio Science Review measurements show 96dB SINAD when using XLR input with 48V 10A power supply, classified in the "excellent" category. SNR reaches 116dB with THD at 0.0015% at 1W, demonstrating superior specifications. Frequency response covers 20Hz-20kHz (±1dB), nearly completely covering the audible range. PFFB technology eliminates load dependency, achieving performance close to the transparent level. However, this peak performance is only achieved with XLR input and 48V 10A power supply combination, with degraded performance when using RCA input.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design combining TPA3255 chip with PFFB technology is technically sound. High-quality components include Sumida audio inductors, NCC large-capacity filter capacitors, German WIMA output capacitors, and Japanese ELNA electrolytic capacitors. The op-amp swapping feature providing sound tuning flexibility is also commendable. However, TPA3255 itself is already widely used existing technology, and PFFB implementation is not particularly innovative. This represents industry-standard technology with proper implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At the 199 USD price point, no cheaper alternative offering equivalent or superior functionality and performance, including XLR input, PFFB technology, and 96dB SINAD, was identified. While products like Fosi Audio V3 (109 USD) and ZA3 (149 USD) exist at lower prices, they lack XLR input or achieve lower SINAD (88-89dB), making them not fully comparable in features and measurement performance. Thus, the A70 holds the position as the most cost-effective option in its specific category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

AIYIMA has established market presence as a Chinese audio brand, but long-term reliability data is limited. Some reviews note the unit gets warm quickly, raising minor concerns about thermal management, but no widespread failure reports exist. Product warranty is at industry standard level, while global support infrastructure is inferior compared to major manufacturers. Due to Class D technology characteristics, failure rates are expected to be relatively low, but lacks proven track record for long-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy is scientifically rational with Class D technology adoption, PFFB implementation for linearity improvement, and high-quality component usage. Development direction contributes to measurable sound quality improvements while eliminating unscientific claims. Practical design elements like XLR/RCA dual compatibility and trigger input functionality are also commendable. Appropriate thermal design within compact chassis is rational.

## Advice

The A70 is an excellent amplifier in terms of measurement performance, achieving 96dB SINAD with XLR input and 48V 10A power supply, surpassing competitors like Fosi Audio V3 (88dB) and ZA3 (89dB). With no cheaper alternatives providing equivalent features such as XLR input and PFFB, it offers superior cost-performance for users requiring balanced connections and high transparency. It provides value when seeking top measurement standards in a compact form. For typical music listening without needing XLR, more affordable options may suffice, but the A70 is recommended for those with clear requirements for advanced features and performance.
