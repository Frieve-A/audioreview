## Overview

The AIYIMA P600 represents the company's 10th anniversary edition passive bookshelf speakers, featuring 6.5-inch carbon fiber composite woofers and 25mm silk dome tweeters with horn loading. Designed specifically for desktop listening with a unique 6° tilted baffle, these speakers target the growing near-field monitoring market. AIYIMA positions this as part of their "Masterpieces of a Decade" collection alongside their A20 amplifier and T20 streaming components, emphasizing technological refinement and cost-effective engineering.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No credible third-party measurements are available from established sources like Audio Science Review or Erin's Audio Corner for the P600. Manufacturer specifications provide basic parameters: 30Hz-20kHz frequency response range, 4-ohm impedance, 50W×2 rated power handling with 150W maximum, and 1900Hz crossover frequency [1]. However, critical audio quality metrics are absent, including frequency response deviation tolerances, harmonic distortion measurements, signal-to-noise ratios, and maximum SPL data. Without independent verification of claimed specifications or measurement of audibility-relevant parameters, Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated and defaults to the framework's provisional score for insufficient data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The P600 employs contemporary materials and design approaches but demonstrates limited technical advancement. The carbon fiber composite woofer provides favorable stiffness-to-weight ratios for pistonic motion control, while the horn-loaded 25mm silk dome tweeter offers controlled dispersion and improved efficiency. The 6° tilted baffle represents practical innovation for desktop optimization, addressing acoustic geometry in near-field applications. Construction uses 18mm MDF front baffles with 15mm walls and internal damping with polyfill. However, these technologies are readily available to competitors without significant proprietary development or technical barriers. The analog-only design lacks digital integration found in contemporary active speakers, limiting technological sophistication relative to current market capabilities.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Cost-performance analysis for the P600 must be considered provisional due to lack of independent measurements for verification of manufacturer specifications. When comparing against products with verified measured data, the landscape reveals significant alternatives. The Neumi BS5 (150 USD) [9] provides independently measured 64Hz-20kHz response (±3dB) from Erin's Audio Corner with 100W maximum power handling, offering substantially lower cost for verified performance. While the P600 claims 30Hz-20kHz response, this specification lacks third-party verification and frequency response tolerance data critical for meaningful comparison.

Provisional comparison using manufacturer specifications suggests the P600's 150W maximum power handling and larger 6.5-inch driver may justify price premium over the Neumi BS5's measured capabilities. However, higher-priced options with verified measurements including Polk Audio Signature Elite ES20 (319-399 USD) [6] and ELAC Debut 3.0 DB63 (499 USD) [7] provide independently verified performance data absent from the P600.

CP = 150 USD ÷ 315.99 USD = 0.47, rounded to 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

AIYIMA provides a 14-day money-back guarantee significantly shorter than industry-standard 2-year warranties, with customer-borne return shipping costs. Support infrastructure remains limited compared to established manufacturers with global presence. The passive design philosophy provides inherent reliability advantages with minimal electronic components susceptible to failure. Construction quality utilizing 18mm MDF baffles and robust binding posts suggests adequate durability for the price category. However, absence of extended warranty coverage and unclear long-term parts availability represent potential concerns for users requiring professional support infrastructure or guaranteed service longevity.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

AIYIMA demonstrates scientifically rational design philosophy emphasizing measurable performance optimization over subjective appeal. Material selection prioritizes engineering properties: carbon fiber cone stiffness for reduced resonance, horn loading for controlled directivity, and tilted baffle geometry for practical acoustic benefits in near-field applications. The company explicitly states "science and technology as foundational to product development" while avoiding occult audio claims. Cost structure reflects functional priorities with premium materials balanced against competitive pricing, suggesting active elimination of non-performance-related expenses. Innovation focus on user-centric solutions (desktop optimization) rather than aesthetic differentiation demonstrates practical engineering approach. Integration of contemporary technologies without unnecessary complexity aligns with rational cost-benefit analysis, supporting the company's technology-driven positioning in competitive markets.

## Advice

The P600 serves desktop listening applications effectively where its tilted design and near-field optimization provide practical advantages over conventional bookshelf speakers. However, consider the Neumi BS5 as a cost-effective alternative with independently verified measurements showing 64Hz-20kHz response for desktop applications at nearly half the price. Choose the P600 if you specifically require the larger 6.5-inch driver size and claimed 150W power handling, but approach manufacturer frequency response claims conservatively without independent measurements for verification. Users requiring extended warranty protection or global support infrastructure should consider established brands despite higher initial costs. The 4-ohm impedance necessitates amplifiers with adequate current capability, particularly important for desktop systems where integrated solutions may have power limitations. For critical listening applications demanding verified performance specifications, prioritize alternatives with established measurement data from credible sources like the Neumi BS5 or await independent measurements of the P600.
