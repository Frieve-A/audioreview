## Overview

The AIYIMA A70 Mono is a monoblock Class D amplifier using Texas Instruments’ TPA3255 with Post Filter Feedback (PFFB). It provides balanced XLR and single-ended RCA inputs, a 12V trigger, and an active subwoofer output with an adjustable low-pass (40–200 Hz) plus a +6 dB RCA gain option. Rated power is 300 W into 4 Ω with a 48 V / 5 A supply[1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Manufacturer specifications state SNR ≥116 dB and THD 0.001% (conditions limited)[1]. Independent data from the stereo A70 (same platform) reports SINAD of roughly 95 dB via XLR and ~85 dB via RCA[2], and shows that PFFB greatly reduces, though does not completely eliminate, load-dependency typical of Class-D designs[3]. For the Mono version, a dedicated third-party review exists but detailed numerical extracts remain limited in public summaries as of this date[4]; we therefore present manufacturer figures alongside related third-party results and will incorporate additional numbers when published.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The TPA3255 + PFFB implementation is competent and practical, with useful system features (XLR/RCA, 12 V trigger, adjustable sub-out)[1]. The socketed NE5532 op-amp enables user serviceability[1]. The design reflects solid industry practice rather than novel breakthroughs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Using matched bundles (amplifier with 48 V / 5 A PSU), the A70 Mono sells at 159.99 USD[5]. The cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative identified is the Fosi Audio V3 Mono at 139.99 USD with the same PSU level, offering PFFB, XLR/RCA inputs, and published SINAD of 101 dB (XLR)[6]. Accordingly, the A70 Mono’s cost-performance is 0.9.  
(Note: while the A70 Mono is also sold as a bare unit at 129.99 USD[1], the comparison here standardizes on PSU-included configurations.)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

User reports indicate generally stable operation with no widespread failure patterns. Long-term reliability datasets are still limited, and global support infrastructure is modest compared to major brands. Class-D thermal/efficiency advantages are positives, but long-horizon field evidence remains developing.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The feature set prioritizes measurable, user-visible benefits (balanced I/O, PFFB, trigger, adjustable sub-out) rather than subjective claims. The choices are practical and engineering-driven.

## Advice

If you need a compact monoblock with balanced input plus subwoofer management and trigger integration in one chassis, the A70 Mono is compelling. If lowest price at equivalent performance is your top priority, the Fosi V3 Mono holds a price advantage in matched-PSU form while offering similar baseline capabilities[6]. Pick the A70 Mono when its integrated sub-out/trigger features simplify your system.
