## Overview

The aiyima A07 MAX is a Class D power amplifier featuring the Texas Instruments TPA3255 chip. It delivers a claimed 300W×2 (4Ω) in stereo mode and 600W (2Ω) in mono mode, equipped with enthusiast features including swappable op-amp chips and bridge mode capability. Positioned as the flagship model in the popular series from Chinese company aiyima, this product aims to achieve high-power output at a relatively affordable price point.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The nominal specifications claim high performance, such as a THD of 0.007% and an S/N ratio of ≥110dB. However, measurement data from reliable third-party sources indicates that it does not fully unlock the potential of the TPA3255 chip. Notably, the frequency response exhibits a typical weakness of Class D amplifiers, fluctuating in the high frequencies depending on the speaker's impedance load. This means it does not achieve a transparent level under all conditions. While it clears minimum performance standards, no significant scientific advantages are confirmed.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the adoption of the TPA3255 chip is reasonable, the design is fundamentally a combination of off-the-shelf components. Some consideration is evident in component selection, such as swappable op-amp sockets and Nichicon electrolytic capacitors, but these are common upgrade techniques. No proprietary circuit design or innovative technology can be confirmed, resulting in a technology level judged to be below the industry average. The stereo/mono switching function is an implementation feature, but its originality in circuit technology is limited. Overall, the configuration is close to that of a pure OEM product.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

A comparison was made with the Fosi Audio V3 (approximately 72 USD), which offers equivalent functionality, against the A07 MAX's market price of approximately 93 USD. The V3 uses the same TPA3255 chip and provides equivalent or superior measured performance, along with a better component composition and design. The CP calculation is: 72 USD ÷ 93 USD = 0.77 (rounded to 0.8). The A07 MAX is clearly at a price disadvantage compared to the superior V3, with its cost-performance falling below acceptable standards.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

aiyima is an emerging Chinese audio company. While a product warranty of one year or more is offered on their official website and through retailers, one cannot expect the established global warranty system or prompt repair services of a major manufacturer. The actual quality of support response is uncertain, and concerns remain about long-term reliability, leading to a reliability rating below the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This product offers versatile features not found in its competitor, the Fosi Audio V3, such as bridge-mode for mono operation and swappable op-amps. These features hold a certain rationality in providing users with expandability and customization options. However, on the other hand, it falls short of the V3 in the pursuit of core audio quality, as measured by performance metrics, giving the impression that added features were prioritized. It doesn't offer enough unique value to fully compensate for its lower cost-performance, thus its design philosophy cannot be evaluated as entirely rational.

## Advice

For those seeking pure performance and cost-effectiveness, the Fosi Audio V3 is a strongly recommended alternative. The V3 offers comparable basic performance with superior design quality and a price advantage. However, if you find clear value in the specific features offered by the A07 MAX, such as the bridge-mode (mono) function or customization through op-amp swapping, it could be a viable choice. It is important to consider, though, that this versatility does not directly translate to superior measured performance.
