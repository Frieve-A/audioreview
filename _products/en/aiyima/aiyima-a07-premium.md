## Overview

The Aiyima A07 Premium is a compact Class D stereo amplifier built around TI’s TPA3255 with NE5532 op-amps. It is sold **with or without a power supply**: the official store lists the base unit without PSU, while some retailers bundle a **32V/5A** adapter and highlight parts such as ELNA and WIMA capacitors. Manufacturer specs include **0.05% THD**, **103 dB SNR**, and a headline **“300 W × 2 (4 Ω, 10% THD+N)”** which is a burst/marketing maximum rather than a continuous rating. A realistic **complete-system** price from the official store is **about 90.98 USD** (A07 Premium **60.99 USD** without PSU + AIYIMA **32V/5A PSU 29.99 USD**).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

- **Independent measurements (A07 platform):** Audio Science Review measured the original A07 at **~82–83 dB SINAD at 5 W/4 Ω** with a **32 V** supply, and **roughly 70–80 W into 4 Ω at ~1% THD+N** (both channels driven). This clears basic performance thresholds but doesn’t reach state-of-the-art transparency.  
- **Manufacturer specs (A07 Premium):** **THD 0.05%**, **SNR 103 dB**, **DC 24–48 V** operation; **20 Hz–20 kHz** FR.  
- **Context:** The “Premium” variant has limited third-party lab data; given shared platform and components, it is **expected to perform similarly** to the earlier A07 unless new measurements show otherwise.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A standard, competent TPA3255 implementation. NE5532 front-end, socketed op-amps for tweakability, and incremental component/thermal updates are practical rather than novel.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **Fosi Audio V3** (includes **32 V** PSU). Independent tests and the manufacturer’s spec sheet indicate **equal or better THD+N/SINAD** versus A07-class implementations. Typical price is **89.99 USD** with the 32 V supply.  
**This product’s complete price (official store):** **~90.98 USD** (base **60.99 USD** + official **32V/5A PSU 29.99 USD**). The A07 Premium lands essentially at parity in out-the-door spend against the lowest-priced equal-or-better option, so the score sits at the top tier.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Warranty/support are typical for budget brands. Build reports are generally acceptable for the price. Long-term reliability data remain limited. Confirm bundle contents (PSU included or not) before purchase.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design aims to deliver near-transparent, low-cost amplification for simple two-channel setups. It prioritizes core performance over extras (e.g., no remote/balanced input), which is coherent for the price segment.

## Advice

If you already own a suitable PSU or want the **lowest up-front spend**, A07 Premium is attractive. If you can allocate about **~0–30 USD** more in some markets, **Fosi V3** offers **clearer measured performance** while staying compact. A **48 V/5 A** supply can add headroom but increases total system cost.
