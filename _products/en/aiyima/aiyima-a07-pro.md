## Overview

The AIYIMA A07 Pro is a compact Class-D stereo amplifier built on TI’s TPA3255. It integrates Bluetooth for wireless input alongside analog RCA and offers a line output for feeding active devices. The design targets budget desktop and small-room setups that need simple, one-box amplification with wireless convenience [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specs list total harmonic distortion of 0.002% and SNR of 90 dB for the amplifier section, with Bluetooth implemented via Qualcomm’s QCC304X (5.2) [2]. Independent bench testing characterizes overall noise/distortion behavior as **competent** for the class with adequate output capability for typical desktop use [1]. These figures are below “state-of-the-art transparent” thresholds but comfortably inside ranges that are generally indistinguishable in normal listening once speakers and rooms dominate system error.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The architecture is conventional for modern budget Class-D: TPA3255 power stage, NE5532 op-amps, and QCC304X Bluetooth. It supports standard 16–24 bit / 44.1–48 kHz BT operation and accepts 24–48 V external power supplies. Replaceable dual op-amp packages add basic service/customization flexibility. Overall, implementation reflects mainstream practice rather than novel engineering [2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Target price:** 78 USD (official store, no-PSU option) [2].  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **Fosi BT20A Pro**, 79.99 USD (official store). It provides Bluetooth input and comparable or better published core metrics (THD+N ≤0.003%, SNR ≥110 dB) and has independent lab coverage [3][4][6].  

No cheaper product offering equivalent user-facing functions **and** equal-or-better measured performance was identified; therefore **CP = 1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The platform (TPA3255) is widely used and parts are readily available, but long-term, independent reliability data specific to A07 Pro are limited. Warranty/support are provided through Aiyima’s channels; documentation and accessory options (various power supplies) are available on the official site [2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product prioritizes practical integration—compact power amplification with built-in Bluetooth and a line out—over exotic features. It’s a straightforward solution for simple two-channel systems where convenience and price are paramount.

## Advice

Choose A07 Pro if you need a small, inexpensive wireless amp for desktop or small-room speakers. Match the power supply voltage/current to your output needs per the manufacturer guidance (higher-voltage PSUs allow more headroom). If you want an alternative with similar functions and strong measurements, also check **Fosi BT20A Pro** and compare current prices and third-party data [3][4][6].
