summary: "A 2.1-channel amplifier with a TPA3255 chip. Its measured output is significantly below the nominal specifications. The existence of a vastly superior alternative at an identical price point results in poor actual value."

## Overview

The Aiyima B07 is a 2.1-channel Class D amplifier combining the Texas Instruments TPA3255 chip with a QCC3040 Bluetooth chip. It claims a rated output of 300W×2 (stereo) + 300W (subwoofer) and features Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity (supporting AAC, SBC, aptX, APTX-LL, APTX-HD). The unit includes independent subwoofer frequency adjustment (±4dB) and cutoff frequency adjustment (50-220Hz) functions, designed as a desktop-oriented compact amplifier supporting DC24-48V power input. It incorporates six NE5532 op-amps and provides bass and treble adjustment functionality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While the rated specifications claim THD 0.01% and SNR 108dB+, actual measurements show significant deviation from the rated output. With 4Ω loads, actual stereo output is approximately 100W×2 RMS and subwoofer output is approximately 100W RMS, substantially below the claimed 300W. It has also been reported that a high-capacity 48V@10A power supply is required to achieve full performance, as high-frequency noise can occur when using a 48V@5A supply. The measurement results do not reach the transparency levels defined in the review policy, leading to a low score for scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption of the TPA3255 chip, Bluetooth 5.2 support via QCC3040, and use of NE5532 op-amps represent an industry-standard technical configuration. The independent subwoofer control functions are practical and appropriately implemented for a dedicated 2.1-channel design. While the use of quality components like Rubycon and ELNA capacitors is commendable, the overall design shows no particular originality or technological innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The B07's current market price is 109 USD. Per review policy, cost-performance is evaluated against products with equivalent or superior performance. The competing Fosi Audio BT30D Pro offers vastly superior measured performance (165W×2+350W) at the identical price of 109 USD. Applying the policy's formula (competitor price ÷ target price) yields `109 USD ÷ 109 USD = 1.0`. The resulting score is 1.0, but this is merely a mechanical result reflecting the price ratio, indicating only that no cheaper alternative exists. It must be strongly noted that this score does not reflect the significant performance difference, and the actual value is overwhelmingly in favor of the Fosi Audio BT30D Pro.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While the Aiyima brand has some market presence, long-term reliability data is limited. User reports indicate heating issues after about 10 minutes of use, suggesting thermal management challenges within the compact chassis. The product warranty is at the industry-standard level, but global support infrastructure is inferior compared to major manufacturers. These heating issues may impact long-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The concept of a dedicated 2.1-channel amplifier is rational. However, the significant discrepancy between rated and measured output raises questions about the product's integrity. Furthermore, a design that effectively requires a non-standard, expensive 48V@10A power supply to achieve its nominal performance compromises user convenience and is not rational. It fails to demonstrate a clear justification for its existence as dedicated audio equipment over general-purpose alternatives.

## Advice

This product is not recommended. The cost-performance score of 1.0 is a byproduct of the calculation rule and does not represent the product's actual value, which is poor. The Fosi Audio BT30D Pro, which is available at the exact same price of 109 USD, overwhelmingly outperforms this product in measured performance. Given the unacceptable gap between claimed and actual performance, coupled with heating issues, there is no rational reason to choose the Aiyima B07. For anyone considering a 2.1-channel amplifier, the Fosi Audio BT30D Pro is the superior choice in every regard.
