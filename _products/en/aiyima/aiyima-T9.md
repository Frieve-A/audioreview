## Overview

The aiyima T9 is a Bluetooth-enabled compact desktop amplifier manufactured by Chinese audio company aiyima. It features the TPA3250 chip and is marketed with "100W×2" power output specifications. However, according to Texas Instruments' official datasheet, the TPA3250 can deliver 70W stereo continuous into 8Ω and up to 130W into 4Ω with a 32V supply, making the claimed 100W×2 specification theoretically achievable but likely referring to peak rather than continuous power. The design emphasizes visual appeal with tube-style LED decoration and VU meters. It offers multiple input terminals (Bluetooth, USB-DAC, optical digital, coaxial digital, RCA) to accommodate various audio sources.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Manufacturer specifications list THD 0.07%, S/N ratio 98dB, and frequency response 20Hz-20kHz (±1dB). These nominal specifications represent standard levels for typical Class-D amplifiers. A THD of 0.07% falls short of the transparent level (0.01% or below), and the S/N ratio of 98dB does not reach the ideal 105dB or higher. Regarding the 100W×2 power output specification, Texas Instruments' TPA3250 datasheet indicates the chip can deliver 70W stereo continuous into 8Ω and up to 130W into 4Ω with a 32V supply, suggesting the claimed power output is within the chip's capabilities, though it likely represents peak rather than continuous power. Comprehensive third-party measurement verification would provide better insight into actual performance versus specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The TPA3250 chip is a capable Class-D amplifier chip from Texas Instruments with respectable specifications, though not cutting-edge by current standards. The circuit design appears to follow typical reference implementations with limited technical innovation. While USB-DAC and Bluetooth function integration is modern, both are standard implementations using off-the-shelf chipsets. The tube-style LED decoration provides only visual effects and contributes nothing to sound quality. The technology level remains at industry average standards with no notable technical advantages.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The T9's current market price is approximately 85 USD (about 12,750 JPY). For a product with equivalent or superior integrated features (Bluetooth, USB-DAC, digital inputs), the Sabaj A4 is available for about 70 USD (about 10,500 JPY). While the Sabaj A4 lacks the T9's tube-style decoration and VU meters, its core amplification and connectivity features are comparable at a lower price. The cost-performance is calculated as `70 USD ÷ 85 USD ≒ 0.82`, resulting in a score of 0.8. In terms of pure function-to-price ratio, the Sabaj A4 has the advantage, but the T9's value proposition depends on whether the user values its aesthetic features.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

aiyima is a relatively new Chinese manufacturer with a limited long-term reliability track record. The warranty period is a standard one year, but the international support infrastructure is inadequate, with repair services in Japan being particularly difficult. Firmware updates and other software support cannot be expected. Third-party verification data regarding product durability has not been published, making long-term reliability unknown.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The T9's design philosophy exhibits a consumer-oriented approach that balances functionality with visual appeal. While the 100W×2 specification may represent peak rather than continuous power, it falls within the TPA3250's theoretical capabilities according to the chip's datasheet. The tube-style LED decoration contributes nothing to sound quality and serves as visual theatrics to appeal to users who value vintage aesthetics. The VU meters prioritize decorative over practical design. However, the integrated design with diverse input terminals (Bluetooth, USB-DAC, multiple digital inputs) aligns with modern convenience needs, showing practical rationality. The design philosophy appears focused on providing an all-in-one solution with visual appeal rather than pursuing maximum sound quality alone.

## Advice

The T9 is suitable for users who want to combine multi-functionality with a retro design that mimics tube amplifiers. Its power specifications are consistent with the capabilities of its chipset. For those seeking pure function-to-price ratio, more affordable alternatives with similar connectivity, such as the Sabaj A4 at around 70 USD, exist. However, the T9's price of approximately 85 USD can be seen as payment for its multi-functionality plus its visual appeal, including the VU meters and tube-style decoration. Before purchasing, it is recommended to consider whether you value these design elements or prefer to prioritize pure performance and cost, and to compare it with alternatives like the Sabaj A4.
