## Overview

The AIYIMA H3 is a compact USB DAC dongle headphone amplifier featuring the ES9039Q2M DAC chip and CT7601 CR USB receiver. Measuring 53mm×20mm×12.5mm and weighing 15.5g, this portable device offers both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs with independent volume control and memory function. Supporting PCM up to 32bit/768kHz and DSD512, the H3 targeted budget-conscious users seeking high-resolution audio capability in an ultra-portable form factor. However, availability appears limited with the product not listed on AIYIMA's official website and reports of promotional clearance pricing affecting long-term procurement viability.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data. While the ES9039Q2M chip specifications suggest excellent performance with 130dB dynamic range, -126dB THD, and -120dB THD+N, no credible third-party measurements of the actual AIYIMA H3 product are available. The manufacturer specifications list output power of 120mW (32Ω SE) and 240mW (32Ω BAL), which fall between problematic and transparent levels for headphone amplification. Critical measurements including frequency response, actual product THD+N, SNR, IMD, and crosstalk remain unknown. According to evaluation framework, when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack comprehensive audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The AIYIMA H3 demonstrates solid technology implementation through adoption of the current-generation ES9039Q2M DAC chip, representing cutting-edge technology that other manufacturers actively seek to adopt. The device incorporates appropriate digital circuit integration with practical features like independent volume control and volume memory function. However, the product appears to be a competitive OEM/ODM implementation without significant proprietary patent technology or unique technical differentiation beyond standard chipset deployment. While the ES9039Q2M's Hyperstream IV sigma-delta modulator technology provides strong foundation, the overall implementation represents standard industry practice without innovative technical advancement, and competitive advantage duration is limited as similar implementations are easily replicated by competitors [2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The AIYIMA H3 is the most affordable option among products with equivalent or better functionality and performance. At 30 USD, the H3 provides both 3.5mm (120mW @ 32Ω) and 4.4mm balanced (240mW @ 32Ω) outputs, independent volume control, volume memory function, and high-resolution format support (PCM 32bit/768kHz, DSD512). The COLORFLY CDA L2 (approximately 130 USD) provides equivalent functionality with similar specifications including 125mW SE and 240mW balanced output at 32Ω, but the AIYIMA H3 is significantly more affordable. While the FiiO Snowsky Tiny B offers lower pricing, it provides significantly inferior output power (68mW SE, 45mW BAL) and lacks independent volume control and memory functions, making it unsuitable for equivalent comparison. Since no equivalent-or-better products exist at a lower price, CP = 1.0 [3][4][8].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The AIYIMA H3 offers standard 2-year warranty coverage with comprehensive global support infrastructure including multiple contact channels (email, phone, social media platforms). However, reliability assessment is negatively impacted by noted build quality concerns regarding adhesive assembly, with user reports suggesting potential durability issues for those unable to perform self-repair. The 14-day return window is notably short compared to industry standards, and return shipping costs are borne by the buyer. While AIYIMA provides typical manufacturer support duration and reasonable repair processes, the combination of construction concerns and limited return period reduces overall reliability confidence [5][6].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The AIYIMA H3 demonstrates solid rationality in design philosophy through scientific technology selection without pseudoscientific claims or unnecessary premium materials. The implementation shows measurement-focused approach using current-generation ES9039Q2M technology, with costs directly contributing to functional performance rather than meaningless luxury elements. The design demonstrates cost optimization and functional integration appropriate for the price point, actively reducing costs unrelated to audio performance while maintaining essential features like independent volume control and format compatibility. AIYIMA's stated philosophy of "responsive to customer feedback" and "iterative product development" aligns with rational engineering approaches focused on practical user benefits rather than subjective audiophile mythology [7].

## Advice

The AIYIMA H3 offers competitive specifications for budget-conscious users, though availability limitations significantly constrain its practical recommendation scope. While the device provides high-resolution audio capability with balanced output functionality at 30 USD, potential buyers face substantial availability challenges as the product is not listed on AIYIMA's official website and reports indicate promotional clearance pricing. Users requiring reliable product availability should consider alternatives like the COLORFLY CDA L2 despite the modest price premium. Additionally, potential buyers should consider the build quality concerns regarding adhesive assembly and evaluate whether self-repair capability is acceptable. Users requiring verified measurement data for critical applications should consider higher-priced alternatives like the Fosi Audio DS1. Due to availability uncertainties, the H3 cannot be recommended as a primary purchasing consideration despite favorable specifications relative to price point.
