## Overview

The KZ EDX is an entry-level in-ear monitor from Knowledge Zenith, a Chinese manufacturer with broad distribution via major online marketplaces. The EDX uses a single 10 mm dynamic driver in a resin shell, with a detachable 0.75 mm 2-pin cable and basic accessories [1][2][5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Multiple third-party reviews consistently describe a V-shaped tuning that departs from neutral reproduction. In particular, one review documents peaks around ~4.5 kHz, ~9 kHz, and ~11 kHz, indicating elevated upper-mid/treble energy that typically requires EQ to balance [1]. Manufacturer-level specifications (as listed on retailer product pages) indicate sensitivity ~112 dB and nominal impedance ~23 Ω, which are adequate for easy driveability but do not imply transparency on their own [5]. No robust, independently published THD/FR tolerance data were found for EDX as of the review date; the score therefore reflects the widely reported non-neutral FR and the absence of transparent-level measurement evidence.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The EDX employs a conventional single 10 mm dynamic driver with a composite diaphragm. The detachable 0.75 mm 2-pin interface is notable at the price, but the overall implementation follows established budget-IEM design without clear innovations beyond basic function [2][5].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Market price for EDX at the brand's store is 13 USD (EDX listing) [3]. The **cheapest equal-or-better** option we could verify is **KZ EDX Lite**, which offers the same user-facing features (detachable 2-pin cable, single dynamic driver) and **manufacturer-stated lower distortion / optimized "three-frequency" performance** [4] at **8.90 USD** [6].  
Required display (CP < 1.0): **8.90 USD / 13 USD = 0.68**.  
As a cross-check, other low-cost detachable-cable IEMs like the TRN MT1 retail higher (14.59 USD) [7].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

KZ sells primarily via global marketplaces and its own stores, but **brand-level warranty length is not clearly stated on official product pages**; actual after-sales support typically follows the retailer's policy [8]. Given the simple construction and replaceable cable, field failures are mitigated somewhat, but the lack of a clearly published global warranty keeps this to a mid-range score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product is tuned for consumer-friendly bass/treble emphasis rather than transparent FR. This prioritizes market taste over fidelity and does not aim for measured transparency. At the price, such compromises are understandable, but not strongly rational from a fidelity-first perspective.

## Advice

If you want the **absolute lowest cost** for a detachable-cable IEM and are comfortable applying EQ for treble peaks, EDX can serve as an ultra-budget entry. If you can spend more, better-measured competitors exist in the sub-25 USD class; for example, **Moondrop Chu II** (~20.69-22.99 USD) is broadly regarded as more neutral and is widely stocked [9].
