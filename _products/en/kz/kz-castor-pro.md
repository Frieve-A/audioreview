## Overview

The KZ Castor Pro is a dual-10 mm dynamic-driver in-ear monitor with an electronic crossover and four tuning switches enabling up to 16 combinations. It is sold in two versions—**Harman Target** and **Harman Target with Improved Bass**—and targets budget users who want switchable voicing in a wired IEM form factor [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No credible third-party laboratory measurements of the **Castor Pro** were found as of August 17, 2025. Manufacturer specs: frequency range **20–40,000 Hz**; impedance **22–40 Ω** (Harman Target) or **16–22 Ω** (Improved Bass); sensitivity **101–104 dB** (Harman Target) or **100–103 dB** (Improved Bass); 0.75 mm 2-pin cable [1]. These are catalog figures and not directly comparable to standardized FR/THD/isolations tests. THD/IMD/crosstalk and isolation remain unverified by independent sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Compared with single-DD budget IEMs, the Castor Pro adds a **dual-DD** architecture, **electronic crossover**, and a **four-switch** system (16 patterns) [1]. These are established, not novel, techniques in the budget segment; execution quality cannot be confirmed without measurements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Per policy, we compare against the **cheapest product with equal-or-better user-visible function and measured fidelity**. **Moondrop CHU II** is widely measured/benchmarked and offers neutral tuning with low distortion for under 25 USD [3][4]. Using current market prices:

- Castor Pro (Amazon US): **25.99 USD** [2]  
- Moondrop CHU II (ShenzhenAudio): **22.99 USD** [3]

**CP = 22.99 USD ÷ 25.99 USD = 0.885**, rounded to **0.9** for scoring. Given CHU II’s verified performance [4] and equivalent core function (wired IEM with detachable cable), Castor Pro’s value is weaker than the cheapest equal-or-better option.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

KZ’s store page provides **returns** guidance (e.g., 7-day returns/claims handling) but does **not** state a clear, model-specific warranty term for Castor Pro [5]. Retailer policies may exceed this (e.g., Amazon’s standard 30-day return window on the current listing) [2]. Absent published failure-rate data, support is assessed as average for the price class.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Emphasis on **16 switchable profiles** and **dual-DD** marketing claims lacks independent evidence of improved transparency over well-tuned single-DD designs. Without third-party data demonstrating lower distortion or tighter FR adherence, the added complexity is not substantiated as a fidelity improvement [1][4].

## Advice

If you want **switch-based voicing** experiments in a sub-30 USD wired IEM, the Castor Pro provides that at **25.99 USD** [2]. If your priority is **measured fidelity per dollar**, **Moondrop CHU II** at **22.99 USD** remains the safer pick due to available third-party measurement coverage and proven neutral tuning [3][4].
