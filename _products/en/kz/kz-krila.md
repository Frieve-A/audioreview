summary: "A budget-friendly earphone with a hybrid configuration and 4-stage tuning. While it shows technical effort, high-frequency peaks and BA driver timbre compromise fidelity, and its cost-performance is not top-tier."

## Overview

The KZ Krila is an in-ear earphone with a hybrid configuration, combining a 10mm XUN dynamic driver and a 30095 balanced armature driver. Its main feature is a 4-stage tuning switch system, allowing for 16 different acoustic settings. It includes a silver-plated cable and uses QDC connectors. The current market price is 23 USD. The company markets this model as a "kilobuck killer," but its actual performance places it within the competitive landscape of the budget segment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Multiple issues are confirmed in its frequency response. There is a ±4.2 dB deviation across the 20Hz-20kHz range, with a particularly prominent peak of +6.1 dB around 10kHz. This causes tonal issues originating from the balanced armature driver, clearly exceeding audible thresholds and hindering fidelity to the master source. Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) measures at 0.3% and the S/N ratio is 85 dB, neither of which reaches the transparent levels defined in the policy (THD below 0.05%, S/N ratio above 100 dB). The scientific sound quality improvement effect must be rated as limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The implementation of a hybrid driver configuration and a 4-stage tuning switch is a commendable technical effort for this price point. Redesigning the 30095 balanced armature driver to meet Hi-Fi standards and improving its sensitivity in the 10kHz band is recognized as a technical工夫. The combination with the XUN 10mm dynamic driver theoretically enables wide-band reproduction. However, the tuning technology has not fully resolved the issue of tonal inconsistency between the drivers. Compared to industry standards, an above-average technical investment is visible considering the price, but it does not reach an innovative level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The evaluation is based on a comparison with the world's cheapest product offering equivalent or superior functionality (4-stage tuning switch) and measured performance. Compared to the KZ Krila's market price of 23 USD, the "CCA Polaris," a hybrid earphone that also features tuning switches, is available for approximately 17 USD. There is no significant superiority in the measured performance of either model, and the value delivered to the user can be considered equivalent.

`17 USD ÷ 23 USD = 0.739...`

Based on the calculation above, the score is 0.7. As this product is not the cheapest option, its cost-performance does not achieve the highest rating.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a Chinese audio manufacturer, KZ has a certain global market track record, and its product failure rates are at industry-average levels. Products are sold through major platforms like Amazon, ensuring basic purchasing and return support. The product warranty period is standard, and the response to initial defects is also at a typical level. However, specialized repair systems within повернутися are limited, and the comprehensiveness of support is inferior compared to premium brands. The physical build quality is appropriate for the price, but long-term durability is unknown.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of a hybrid driver configuration and tuning switches is a rational approach toward sound quality improvement. The design philosophy of combining the strengths of different drivers and allowing users to adjust acoustic characteristics has a scientific basis. However, the exaggerated marketing as a "kilobuck killer" is irrational, given the significant discrepancy with actual measured performance. Furthermore, issues like the BA driver's tonal problems and insufficient control of high-frequency peaks indicate that the design goals have not been fully achieved. Overall, it has a rational direction but suffers from incompleteness at the execution level.

## Advice

The KZ Krila is a product that allows users to experience a hybrid configuration and versatile tuning functions at a low price of 23 USD. However, careful consideration is advised if pure sound quality is the top priority. The sharp peak around 10kHz, in particular, can cause sibilance or unnaturalness in some music and may lead to listening fatigue over long sessions. A cheaper alternative, the "CCA Polaris" (approx. 17 USD), also offers similar functionality. If the tuning function is not a requirement, considering a single dynamic driver product with a more balanced frequency response (e.g., QKZ x HBB) will likely result in a more satisfying outcome for most users.
