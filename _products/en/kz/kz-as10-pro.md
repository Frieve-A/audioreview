## Overview

The KZ AS10 Pro is a 5-balanced-armature per side IEM with a detachable 2-pin cable. The manufacturer lists specific BA units (22955 low, 29689 mid, 30019 high, and a 31736 high/ultra-high dual-array) and states the use of “precision electronic crossover” and a silver-plated OFC cable [1]. Nominal specs are 26 Ω impedance, 109 dB sensitivity, and 20–40 kHz bandwidth [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As of August 15, 2025, we did not find credible third-party full measurements for the **AS10 Pro** itself (FR/THD/IMD/isolation). We therefore anchor at 0.5 and document manufacturer numbers: 26 Ω, 109 dB, 20–40 kHz [1]. For context only, the earlier **KZ AS10** (non-Pro) has independent measurements on RTINGS, indicating well-controlled group delay and decent unit matching under their rig, but that does not establish the AS10 Pro’s response or distortion [6]. Until independent data appear, audibility claims remain unverified beyond specs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A 5-BA array with a named parts stack (22955/29689/30019/31736 array) and an electronic crossover is a competent architecture at this price tier [1]. However, without verified superior measured outcomes versus current best-in-class IEMs, it does not demonstrate industry-leading achievement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Representative market price for AS10 Pro is **68.99 USD** [2]. The **7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2** is the cheapest widely available *equivalent-or-better* alternative we identified: detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, neutral-target-adjacent FR evidenced on a 5128 database, and published THD spec <1% at 1 kHz (manufacturer) [3][4].  
**CP calculation:** 24.99 USD ÷ 68.99 USD = 0.362 → **0.4** (rounded to one decimal).

*Equivalence note (user-visible outcomes):* both are wired IEMs with detachable cables; Zero:2 shows target-conforming FR on independent rigs [4] and meets basic distortion spec [3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Detachable 2-pin cabling aids serviceability. Warranty coverage typically depends on the retailer; for example, Linsoul advertises **1-year** warranty coverage for IEMs [5]. KZ’s own site provides returns/warranty contact but does not state a universal global term [6]. Overall, field reliability is average for low-cost IEMs; support experiences vary by seller and region.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The stated goal emphasizes multi-BA hardware and an “electronic crossover” [1]. Without independent evidence that the Pro’s response/distortion approach transparent thresholds for headphones, prioritizing driver count over verified output metrics remains only partly rational from a fidelity standpoint.

## Advice

If you want a multi-BA KZ with a detachable cable and like the brand’s presentation, audition the AS10 Pro—but weigh alternatives with proven measurements. The **7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2 (24.99 USD)** offers detachable cable and well-documented tuning [3][4]. If neutrality is the priority and you don’t require multi-BA marketing, Zero:2 is the safer bet pending third-party AS10 Pro lab data.
