## Overview

The KZ ZSN Pro 2 is a 1BA+1DD hybrid driver configuration in-ear monitor released by Chinese audio manufacturer KZ in 2024. Priced at 19 USD (market price as of July 2025), this budget-oriented product features a 10mm ultra-linear dynamic driver and an improved 30095 balanced armature driver, with a newly designed electronic crossover circuit aimed at optimizing frequency response. The KZ brand has been known for cost-effective audio products since its establishment in 2008, and the ZSN Pro 2 continues this product philosophy.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The measurement performance of the KZ ZSN Pro 2 clearly shows problematic levels according to headphone and earphone standards. Scientific measurements reveal a significant resonance around 6kHz in the frequency response, which substantially deviates from the standard range (±3dB). The total harmonic distortion approaches 0.5%, nearing the problematic level (0.5% or higher), despite claims of improved balanced armature drivers. This is far from the excellent level (0.05% or below). Waterfall measurements show issues with resonance characteristics around 6kHz, indicating problems in time-domain performance as well. These measurement results reach problematic levels across multiple indicators, resulting in a low scientific validity evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This product achieves an appropriate technology level for the 19 USD price range. In the 1BA+1DD hybrid configuration, the 10mm ultra-linear dynamic driver balances low-frequency quantity and speed, while the improved 30095 balanced armature contributes to enhanced high-frequency resolution. Particularly noteworthy is the newly designed electronic crossover circuit, which achieves more precise frequency division compared to conventional passive crossovers. However, these technologies are not industry-leading but rather represent appropriate combinations and tuning of existing technologies. While no special uniqueness is observed in driver placement or housing design, sufficient technological investment has been made considering the price point.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The cost-performance evaluation of the KZ ZSN Pro 2 requires comparison with products offering equivalent or superior measurement performance in the same price range. Against its price of 19 USD, a strong comparison target is the Moondrop CHU II (18.99 USD). Despite its single dynamic driver configuration, the CHU II achieves THD≤0.05%, an excellent level of distortion performance, and its frequency response deviation is more controlled. From a user's perspective, a sonically superior product is available for a slightly lower price. The calculation (competitor price ÷ target price) is `18.99 USD ÷ 19 USD ≒ 0.999`, which rounds to a score of 1.0. While the hybrid configuration offers some appeal, its inferior measurement performance means it holds no cost-performance advantage.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

KZ, as a Chinese manufacturer established in 2008, has established a certain position in the budget-oriented audio market but remains at standard levels in reliability and support compared to premium brands. The product warranty is provided through various retailers, with a 1-year warranty coverage through major sales channels such as Amazon, Linsoul, and Headphone Zone. While specific failure rate data is not publicly available, it is estimated to be at a general level for products in this price range. Firmware updates are unnecessary due to the product's nature, and repair systems and customer support quality are at industry-average levels. While more established than emerging manufacturers, it lacks the reassurance of established audio brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design philosophy of the KZ ZSN Pro 2 shows a significant lack of rationality. While the hybrid driver configuration is theoretically sound, the actual measurement results show deterioration in basic sound quality indicators such as the 6kHz resonance and high harmonic distortion. The adoption of an electronic crossover also fails to reflect the expected improvement in frequency division accuracy in measurement results, making the technical investment insufficient in terms of outcomes. A more serious problem is launching a product with inferior measurement performance when a competitor like the Moondrop CHU II with clearly superior measurement performance exists in the same price range. From the perspective of achieving scientifically transparent sound quality, the decision to proceed with product development without performance improvements exceeding existing excellent competitors is irrational.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the KZ ZSN Pro 2, we strongly recommend choosing the Moondrop CHU II (18.99 USD), which offers superior measurement performance in the same price range. The CHU II achieves THD≤0.05%, an excellent distortion performance, and a flatter frequency response, making it clearly superior in scientific sound quality indicators. Even if you have a particular interest in hybrid driver configurations, this product's 6kHz resonance and harmonic distortion issues may cause auditory fatigue during extended listening. If you still choose this product, we recommend limiting its use to short listening sessions or specific musical genres, understanding its measurement performance limitations. Those who prioritize objective sound reproduction should recognize that superior alternatives exist in the same price range.
