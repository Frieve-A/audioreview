## Overview

KZ’s ZSN Pro X is a hybrid wired IEM (1 dynamic + 1 balanced armature) with a metal/resin shell and detachable 2-pin cable. It targets entry-level buyers seeking an inexpensive, repairable earphone with a fun tilt. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs: sensitivity **112 dB**, impedance **25 Ω**, frequency range **7–40,000 Hz**. Connector is **0.75 mm** 2-pin; plug is 3.5 mm. [1] Third-party testing reports that its frequency response **tracks the target closely** with a **small bump around 5 kHz (~+5 dB)**, plus a **slight under-emphasis between ~300 Hz and 1 kHz**; **distortion is low**. Measured **passive isolation hovers ~20–40 dB in the highs** (fit-dependent). [2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A conventional **1DD+1BA** hybrid and analog 3.5 mm IEM with standard 0.75 mm 2-pin interface—no DSP/ANC or novel driver tech. Solid basics, little innovation. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Review target price (denominator): 21.00 USD** (Linsoul current regular price). [3]  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator (numerator): Moondrop CHU II — 22.99 USD** (Amazon US; single DD with strong target adherence and low distortion). [5][6]

**Reason for equivalence:** Both are wired IEMs with detachable cables and competent measured performance; CHU II’s response adherence and low THD are equal-or-better. [6]

Because no **cheaper** equivalent-or-better product was confirmed at review time, **CP = 1.0** (clamped). [5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Detachable cable improves repairability. Linsoul lists a **1-year IEM warranty** (cable 3 months). Build and QA are typical for the price; buy from reputable sellers. [3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Design prioritizes a lively, slightly bright tilt over strict neutrality. The straightforward hybrid implementation and omission of advanced features are rational for cost control, but leave measurable improvements untapped. [1][2]

## Advice

- Prefer a **slightly brighter treble**? ZSN Pro X can be pleasing as is.  
- **Treble-sensitive or neutrality-seeking** listeners should consider smoother options like **Moondrop CHU II**. [6]  
- Tip rolling and deeper insertion can improve isolation and subtly reduce perceived treble. [2]
