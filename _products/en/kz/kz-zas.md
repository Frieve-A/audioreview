## Overview

The KZ ZAS is a 16-driver (7BA+1DD per side) hybrid in-ear monitor (IEM) developed by Knowledge Zenith. It features a complex configuration, combining one 10mm dual-magnet dynamic driver with one 30019 high-frequency balanced armature and six 50024s balanced armatures (three dual configurations) for mid-high frequencies. The unit comes with a standard 200-core silver-plated cable and has an impedance of 24Ω with a sensitivity of 109dB/mW. Positioned as one of KZ's "flagship" models, it features the company's most bass-focused tuning.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The KZ ZAS shows below-average measured performance. While the 24Ω impedance and 109dB/mW sensitivity are within acceptable ranges, significant sound quality issues have been identified. Reviews highlight "quantity over quality" bass characteristics, bleed from low frequencies into the midrange, and metallic treble coloration, indicating transparency problems. Despite the 16-driver configuration, technical performance falls short of expectations, with a narrower soundstage compared to competing products and a tendency to emphasize width over height. While detailed THD+N and SNR measurement data are not available, multiple review sources report sound quality limitations, leading to a low scientific validity rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 16-driver configuration (7BA+1DD) represents a technically ambitious approach. The combination of a 10mm dual-magnet dynamic driver with a dedicated high-frequency 30019 BA and six 50024s BAs for mid-high frequencies demonstrates complex engineering. The inclusion of a 200-core silver-plated cable also shows technical consideration. However, reviews frequently note that "technical performance falls short of expectations relative to driver count," with the complex configuration not necessarily translating to improved sound quality. Given that current market competitors achieve superior results with fewer drivers, the technical approach raises efficiency questions. Nevertheless, the technical challenge of multi-driver implementation deserves recognition.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The KZ ZAS is priced at 9,800 JPY. However, a competing product, the "7Hz Salnotes Zero," offers a balanced and superior sound quality at a much lower price of 3,500 JPY. Despite its single dynamic driver configuration, the Salnotes Zero is widely praised in reviews for its natural timbre and tuning, free from the sonic issues of the ZAS (metallic highs, unnatural mids). For many users, it provides an "equivalent or superior" musical experience. The cost-performance is significantly lowered by the existence of this cheaper alternative. The calculation is 3,500 JPY ÷ 9,800 JPY ≈ 0.357, which rounds to a score of 0.4.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

KZ has established itself as a Chinese audio brand with global distribution networks. Purchase options are available through multiple channels including Amazon, AliExpress, and official stores, with basic support infrastructure in place. However, the ZAS appears to be discontinued, with stock unavailable at many retailers, raising concerns about long-term product support. Reviews also point to "cheap build quality for the price" and "resin construction too lightweight, lacking premium feel," creating durability concerns. Warranty periods and repair support are expected to be at standard Chinese brand levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the 16-driver configuration is technically complex, its rationality is questionable given current market trends. With competitors (Truthear, Moondrop, etc.) achieving superior sound quality through simple single dynamic drivers, the multi-driver "numbers game" approach appears outdated. Reviews indicate "limited sound quality improvement relative to driver count" and "technical performance below expectations," suggesting that the invested technology does not effectively contribute to audible improvements. Additionally, issues typical of multi-driver configurations persist, such as "quantity over quality bass" and "metallic treble coloration," limiting the design philosophy's contribution to transparency improvement. Given that competing products achieve superior results with fewer drivers, the rationality is rated as low.

## Advice

While the KZ ZAS boasts a 16-driver configuration, its sound quality does not justify its price. For its 9,800 JPY price, alternatives like the "7Hz Salnotes Zero" (3,500 JPY) or the "Truthear x Crinacle Zero: Red" (around 8,200 JPY) offer far more rational choices with more balanced sound. The Salnotes Zero, in particular, delivers a more natural and pleasant sound at about a third of the price, making it overwhelmingly superior from a cost-performance perspective.

If considering the ZAS purchase, understand that EQ adjustment will likely be necessary. The bass-focused tuning may appeal to some listeners, but it is unsuitable for those seeking balanced sound quality. In the current mid-range IEM market, we recommend prioritizing practicality, as products with simpler configurations often achieve superior results.
