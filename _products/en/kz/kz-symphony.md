summary: "The KZ Symphony adopts an ambitious hybrid configuration, but its measurement performance is problematic and inferior to cheaper single-driver products. Consequently, its cost-performance and design rationality are highly questionable, resulting in a low overall evaluation."

## Overview

The KZ Symphony is a hybrid in-ear monitor combining a 13.2mm planar driver with a 6mm dynamic driver. Released in 2024 by KZ Acoustics of China, this product aims for an acoustic design that leverages the characteristics of each driver through a combination of planar magnetic drive technology and conventional dynamic drivers. It features a 3D-printed resin housing with a metal alloy faceplate and employs a semi-open design to suppress internal resonance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The KZ Symphony's measurement performance receives a low evaluation. Measurement data from independent institutions reveals a V-shaped frequency response with significant peaks, especially in the high-frequency range. This deviates substantially from the ideal tolerance for faithful sound reproduction (±3.0 dB from 20Hz-20kHz). While this could be considered intentional tuning, from a scientific perspective that values fidelity to the master source, it must be rated as "problematic." The theoretical advantages of the planar driver have not translated into the final product's measured performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The hybrid configuration of a 13.2mm planar driver and a 6mm dynamic driver is a technically ambitious endeavor. The miniaturization of planar magnetic technology and its coordination with a dynamic driver for bass reinforcement show design originality. The use of 3D printing for a precision housing and a four-way independent acoustic duct design are also modern approaches. However, the integration technology, such as crossover tuning and phase alignment between the drivers, is immature and does not reach the industry's highest standards. While the challenging design concept is commendable, the technology does not sufficiently contribute to the final acoustic performance.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The KZ Symphony is priced at approximately 69.99 USD. However, measurement performance equal to or better than this product (especially in terms of frequency response flatness) can be achieved by more affordable products. For example, the 7Hz Salnotes Zero 2 exists as a product with a more ideal frequency response for around 25 USD.
The cost-performance is based on the following calculation:
`25 USD (competitor price) ÷ 69.99 USD (subject price) = 0.357`
Rounding this gives a score of 0.4. Since a cheaper product demonstrates superior measured results, the cost-performance of this product is rated as low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As an emerging Chinese audio brand, KZ Acoustics has a wide range of products, but objective long-term reliability data is limited. The product warranty offers a standard period, but the global support system and repair network are still developing. While this product category does not require firmware updates, there is also a lack of sufficient verification data regarding physical durability. Based on these factors, it is evaluated as meeting the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A hybrid configuration of planar and dynamic drivers is, in theory, a rational approach. However, the fact that an inexpensive single dynamic driver product like the 7Hz Salnotes Zero 2 achieves superior measured results casts significant doubt on the rationality of this product's complex hybrid configuration. The technical challenge has not necessarily led to a rational outcome of improved auditory quality. Rather, its design philosophy is deemed irrational as it is outperformed by a simpler, cheaper method.

## Advice

The KZ Symphony is a product for users interested in the technical aspect of a hybrid configuration. However, if you prioritize pure acoustic performance or cost-effectiveness, this product is not recommended. Especially if you seek sound faithful to the master source, this product's frequency response is not ideal. In the same or a much lower price range (around 20-30 USD), there are products like the 7Hz Salnotes Zero 2 that offer far superior measurement performance. It is advisable to first establish a baseline for audio performance with those products. The Symphony should only be considered if you have a technical curiosity for the acoustic effects of combining different driver types, despite these shortcomings.
