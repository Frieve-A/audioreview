## Overview

The KZ Castor represents an innovative approach to budget IEM design, featuring a dual dynamic driver configuration with Harman target tuning. Utilizing a stacked cavity design with separate 10 mm and 8 mm drivers optimized for different frequency ranges, the Castor includes four tuning switches enabling 16 different sound profiles. KZ’s precision injection molding achieves 0.01 mm tolerances, significantly exceeding traditional 3D printing standards, while maintaining an ultra-competitive price point.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent measurements confirm broadly competent but not fully transparent performance for this class. Public lab data show the Castor’s frequency response can be nudged a few dB via its four DIP switches but does not perfectly trace the Harman target; treble exhibits modest unevenness and measured distortion rises in parts of the upper range on the tested unit [1]. Manufacturer specifications quote impedance at 31–35 Ω (Harman version) or 16–20 Ω (Improved Bass) and sensitivity at 105 ± 3 dB / 103 ± 3 dB respectively [2], which is typical for IEMs—easily driven by common dongles and phones. KZ’s own tuning table indicates bass and treble switches alter levels in ~1–2 dB steps (up to four settings), allowing small, repeatable adjustments rather than wholesale retuning [2]. Overall, it approaches a neutral preference curve but still shows audible departures in presence/treble on third-party rigs, warranting a 0.6.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Castor employs advanced dual-driver stacked architecture with separate frequency optimization rather than simple parallel configuration. KZ’s precision injection molding achieves 0.01 mm internal structure tolerances, representing meaningful manufacturing advancement versus basic 3D-printed shells. The four-stage tuning system with independent low/high adjustments shows thoughtful acoustic engineering. However, the drivers themselves are conventional dynamics without proprietary breakthroughs, so this is strong execution of established principles rather than novel tech.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current representative US price is 14.99–16.99 USD at the brand’s official store; we use 15 USD as the denominator for this review [3]. We could not identify any cheaper product that simultaneously matches the Castor’s user-visible functions (four tuning switches, detachable 0.75 mm 2-pin cable) and equal-or-better measured performance (FR/THD class) from reputable sources. Popular budget models such as Moondrop CHU II are inexpensive but lack the tuning-switch functionality and are not cheaper at current US pricing (≥ 22.99 USD) [5]. Therefore, as of August 16, 2025, no cheaper equivalent exists and CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Standard 1-year warranty coverage and global distribution are available via KZ’s official channels [3]. The detachable 0.75 mm 2-pin cable mitigates the most common failure mode. The housing uses injection-molded shells (not full-metal), and long-term reliability data remain limited for this model. Given price constraints, support responsiveness and QC appear average for the segment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

KZ’s implementation of preference-curve tuning with small, documented switch steps is a rational, measurement-first approach. Allowing subtle corrections to bass/treble while keeping a neutral-ish midrange aligns with transparent playback goals at minimal cost. Dual-driver frequency allocation is applied pragmatically to hit targets rather than for marketing spectacle, and manufacturing precision is used where it measurably matters.

## Advice

The KZ Castor suits listeners seeking a budget, measurement-oriented IEM with small, repeatable tuning options. It is easy to drive from standard smartphone dongles; an external amp is unnecessary. Use the switches to trim bass/treble rather than expecting a wholesale signature change. Tip selection and a good seal will have more impact than cable swaps.
