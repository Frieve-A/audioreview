## Overview

The procable WATTEGATE Shielded Power Cable is a 100% shielded power cable combining US-made WATTGATE unplated plugs with a custom power cable from US-based A2D Corporation. Both male and female plugs feature completely unplated specifications, while the cable section adopts a shielded structure. The design is positioned as a product that blocks noise and prevents interference, with particular consideration for noise countermeasures when using 200V power transformers. Two variations are available in transparent and black plugs, priced at 7,222 JPY.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

While this product fulfills the basic function of transmitting the required voltage and current, the claimed sound quality improvements from its shielded structure are not scientifically proven. Differences between properly specified power cables are generally considered indistinguishable in ABX blind tests. Any audible change is likely attributable to placebo effect rather than objective evidence. Therefore, its scientific validity as an audio enhancement product is extremely low.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The combination of WATTGATE connectors and custom shielded cable represents a standard level as an application of established technology. The adoption of unplated plugs is inferior in corrosion resistance but represents a rational choice from the perspective of contact resistance. The 100% shielded structure is appropriate as electromagnetic interference countermeasures, but this type of shielding technology is an existing method widely adopted in the industry. No innovative technological innovation or adoption of patented technology can be confirmed, evaluating to a technical level slightly below industry average. Compared to competing products adopting more advanced conductor materials or innovative shield designs, it lacks technological advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

For cost-performance evaluation, the Parts Express Shielded AC Power Cable (model 110-314) is selected as the comparison target. This product is sold for 6.49 USD (approximately 1,038 JPY) at 12 feet length, equipped with 18 AWG, IEC-60320-C13 connector, and complete shielded structure, designed for use with pro audio equipment. Functionally, it provides power supply and shielding performance equivalent to the procable product. Applying the cost-performance calculation formula (1,038 JPY รท 7,222 JPY = 0.143), the score becomes 0.1. This indicates that the procable product has approximately 7 times the price setting compared to the cheapest alternative with equivalent functionality, meaning significantly inferior cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

WATTEGATE connectors are products with a proven industry track record, ensuring connection reliability. Long-term durability through the shielded structure can also be expected. However, unplated plugs may oxidize depending on the environment, requiring attention to contact resistance changes during long-term use. procable's support system is at a certain standard, but specific warranty periods and repair response details are not clear. While there is a track record of professional use, detailed failure rate data and technical support system disclosure are insufficient, not reaching the industry's highest standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The idea of shielding a power cable for EMI protection has some rationality. However, choosing expensive components for this purpose based on the scientifically weak claim that it improves audible sound quality is not rational. Since equivalent power delivery and shielding functions can be achieved with far cheaper generic cables, there is no justification for its high price as a specialized audio product. A design that disregards cost-effectiveness to this extent must be evaluated as irrational.

## Advice

When considering the purchase of this product, a price comparison with alternatives having equivalent functionality is strongly recommended. The Parts Express Shielded AC Power Cable (6.49 USD, approximately 1,038 JPY) provides equivalent functionality of an IEC connector, complete shielding, and pro audio support at approximately one-seventh the price. For typical home audio applications, audible improvements commensurate with this price difference cannot be scientifically expected. The procable product's price would only be limitedly justified for users who find value in factors other than performance, such as a special commitment to the WATTGATE brand. For those prioritizing a pure performance-to-price ratio, considering more rational alternatives is strongly recommended.
