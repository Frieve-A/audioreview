## Overview

The procable 超越重鉄タップ is an audio equipment-specific power strip manufactured by Japan's procable company. It features a 3.2mm thick heavy iron casing and shielded cables, utilizing US-made WATTGATE plugs. Multiple configurations are available from 2 to 10 outlets, with cable lengths selectable from 1m to 3m. The company positions this as an evolved product from their conventional "heavy iron strip," claiming audio equipment sound quality improvements. The price is approximately 125 USD for the 6-outlet 2m model.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

While the product fulfills basic power strip functions, no scientific evidence supports its claimed sound quality improvement effects on audio equipment. The thick iron casing theoretically provides a shielding effect, but it is extremely unlikely to produce any audibly meaningful improvement at the electromagnetic noise levels found in a typical home environment. The product description claims a specific "sound quality improvement of about 0.3 rank," but no objective measurement data or comparative test results are provided to support these claims. For a product claiming to improve power quality, measurements such as THD improvement, noise rejection characteristics, and frequency response are essential, none of which are disclosed.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The use of a heavy iron casing and shielded cables has some technical rationale as a countermeasure against electromagnetic noise. The 3.2mm thick iron casing provides physical shielding, and the use of WATTGATE plugs may contribute to reducing contact resistance. However, these techniques are merely a combination of existing industrial technologies and lack originality or innovation. Compared to modern power filtering technology, it lacks advanced elements like active filtering or voltage stabilization, relying solely on a passive shielding design. The technology level is rated as below the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Since the sound quality improvement claimed by this product is not scientifically substantiated, its effective function is limited to "power distribution." As a comparison, we consider the general-purpose power strip "Elecom T-NSLK-2620BK" (6 outlets, 2m, 10 USD), which includes lightning surge protection and is thus more functional, to be the least expensive product with equivalent or superior functionality. Based on this, the cost-performance is calculated as 10 USD ÷ 125 USD = 0.079, resulting in a score of 0.1. The majority of the product's price is for the manufacturing cost of the heavy iron casing, whose contribution to sound quality is unclear, making it a remarkably expensive product for the actual value delivered to the user.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Procable is a company with a sales track record in Japan. While specific warranty periods and failure rate data are not disclosed, the risk of mechanical failure is considered low due to its heavy iron construction. However, the sales condition of not accepting returns or refunds for custom products is problematic from a consumer protection standpoint. Support is said to be available via phone and email, but details are unknown. It is rated as average compared to industry standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy of adopting a massive, heavy casing for the purpose of "sound quality improvement" that lacks scientific basis is extremely irrational. In modern audio science, technically measurable solutions like active filtering are established for power-related issues. Ignoring these and adhering to an outdated method of passive shielding with unverified effects is anachronistic. This is a typical example of the irrational "bigger is better" materialism in audio, which only increases costs without providing clear benefits to the user. Therefore, the rationality of the design philosophy is rated at the lowest level.

## Advice

For those considering improving their audio system's power environment, this product is not recommended. If you are looking for a more functional power conditioner, choosing a product based on measured data, such as the Furman M-8Lx (227 USD) with its voltage stabilization and active noise filtering functions, will yield more reliable results. If only basic power strip functionality is needed, a product with lightning protection like the Elecom T-NSLK-2620BK (10 USD) is sufficient and allows for significant cost savings. For improving audio quality, investments in speaker placement or room acoustics will provide more measurable and audibly distinct improvements than power accessories.
