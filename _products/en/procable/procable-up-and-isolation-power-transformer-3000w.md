## Overview

The procable Up & Isolation Power Transformer 3000W (Model: STH-323A) was a 230V step-up and isolation power transformer sold as an OEM product manufactured by STAR ELECTRIC. It combines 200V to 230V step-up functionality with isolation capabilities, primarily intended for use with professional audio equipment from overseas. Its past selling price was 158,000 JPY.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The scientific validity of this product must be rated extremely low. The most critical issue is the complete absence of published measurement data supporting the isolation performance or power purification effects. Basic electrical characteristics such as THD, S/N ratio, and frequency response are not specified, making the scientific basis for claims like "purifies power" unclear. No specific values for isolation performance, including withstand voltage or noise reduction rates, are provided. A quantitative evaluation of the performance is impossible.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The technology level is rated below the industry average. The isolation technology and electrostatic shielding used in this product are common techniques established decades ago in the power transformer industry, with no special originality or advancement recognized. As an OEM product from STAR ELECTRIC, procable's proprietary technology development appears limited. The 115V + 115V balanced transmission is merely a combination of existing technologies and is not innovative. There is insufficient information to evaluate the technical standards of the design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The cost-performance is rated as poor. Compared to this product's price of 158,000 JPY, products with practically equivalent functions exist in the industrial market for significantly less. A specific comparison can be made with the "TZ22-03KB" from industrial transformer manufacturer TOYOZUMI. This product is a 3kVA isolation transformer that can output 220V or 240V from a 200V input, making it compatible with most 230V-rated equipment. Its market price is approximately 68,000 JPY.
Based on this actual price, the cost-performance is calculated as "68,000 JPY ÷ 158,000 JPY ≈ 0.43," resulting in a score of 0.4. Since an alternative exists for less than half the price, this product's pricing is excessively high.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Reliability and support are evaluated at a standard level. The product came with a 1-year warranty, providing an industry-standard support structure. The manufacturer, STAR ELECTRIC, is recognized for having a certain quality standard, so basic product quality is likely ensured. On the other hand, the market reputation of the distributor, procable, is mixed, with considerable skepticism regarding their technical claims. Long-term reliability is difficult to judge based on track record.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product concept itself—a step-up isolation transformer for using 230V equipment in Japan's 200V environment—is rational. It is based on established technologies, and unscientific claims are limited. However, it is difficult to find a compelling reason to choose this audio-branded product when cheaper industrial alternatives exist. Since no clear performance advantages are demonstrated with data, the rationality of its design philosophy receives a standard rating.

## Advice

Even if you need a high-capacity step-up isolation transformer to use 230V equipment in Japan, we do not recommend purchasing this product. This is because an industrial isolation transformer with practically equivalent functions, such as the TOYOZUMI "TZ22-03KB," is available for less than half the price, at around 68,000 JPY. The advertised "power purification" effect has an unclear scientific basis, so you should not have excessive expectations. We strongly recommend choosing a more cost-effective industrial alternative.
