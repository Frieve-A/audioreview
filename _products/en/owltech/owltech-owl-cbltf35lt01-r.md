summary: "Lightning-to-3.5 mm DAC adapter with pass-through charging and inline remote. Solid spec (48 kHz/24-bit), MFi, mic support, and a 2-year warranty; few independent measurements, but the current street price is favorable versus verified 2-in-1 rivals."

## Overview

The Owltech OWL-CBLTF35LT01-R is a Lightning-to-3.5 mm audio adapter with an integrated DAC supporting up to 48 kHz/24-bit, an inline controller, and a pass-through Lightning port so you can charge while listening. It carries Apple’s MFi certification, uses aramid fiber reinforcement with a rated 20,000+ bend tolerance, supports CTIA 4-pole headsets (mic/remote), and includes a 2-year warranty. [1][2]

**Compatibility note:** Works with Lightning iPhones and iPads (e.g., iPhone 14/SE families). It is not for USB-C iPhone 15 series.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications confirm a DAC capable of 48 kHz/24-bit output and headset (CTIA) mic support. That spec ceiling is consistent with transparent playback on Apple Lightning audio, but Owltech does not publish THD, SNR, crosstalk, or frequency-response plots. Absent third-party measurements, we treat audible transparency as unproven and assign the baseline score. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product combines a conventional Lightning DAC with a charge-through Lightning port and inline remote. The design emphasizes durability (aramid fiber, 20k-bend rating) and practicality rather than novelty; there’s no evidence of unique processing or architecture beyond the standard MFi Lightning-audio path. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Basis (as of August 24, 2025):** Among verified 2-in-1 adapters that **both** pass Lightning charging **and** provide 3.5 mm analog audio at up to 48 kHz/24-bit with MFi certification, Belkin’s 3.5 mm Audio + Charge RockStar is a mainstream benchmark at **34.99 USD**. The review target’s street price is **about 20 USD** (converted from current JP retail). We could not verify any cheaper equivalent-or-better 2-in-1 model from reputable sellers meeting the same functional and spec conditions; therefore **CP = 1.0** (no cheaper equivalent confirmed). [1][2][3][4]

*Equivalence note (Belkin comparator):* also supports simultaneous charging, 3.5 mm output, MFi, and up to 48 kHz/24-bit. [4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Two-year warranty is industry-average; construction choices (aramid reinforcement, 20k-bend rating) are reasonable for longevity. Global support presence is limited, but the simple form factor and MFi compliance are positives. Netting these factors gives a slightly-above-average score. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Targeting Lightning devices that still need wired audio while charging is a practical, user-centric approach. The measured-spec ceiling (48/24) is appropriate for the interface, and the inclusion of pass-through power plus inline controls is coherent. Lack of published measurements or distinctive DSP keeps this from a higher score. [1]

## Advice

- Choose this if you specifically need **Lightning** devices to charge and use 3.5 mm headphones/mic at the same time with MFi assurance.  
- If you have a **USB-C iPhone (15 series)**, pick a USB-C audio + charge adapter instead.  
- Inline remotes (play/pause/volume) generally work with supported apps; behavior can vary by app.
