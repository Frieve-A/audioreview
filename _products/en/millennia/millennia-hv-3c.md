## Overview

The Millennia HV-3C is a two-channel, stereo-matched microphone preamplifier engineered for applications where absolute transparency is required. A transformerless, fully balanced signal path with a matched discrete transistor octet and a laser-trimmed FET output stage yields ultra-low distortion, very wide bandwidth, and large headroom. Its 36-position detented gain (1.5 dB/step) is stereo-matched within 0.08 dB, enabling precise stereo work[1][2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

(Manufacturer specifications unless noted)

- **THD+N**: **0.0005% typ.** at 35 dB gain, +27 dBu out; **<0.001%** under stated conditions[1]  
- **Frequency response**: **sub 3 Hz to beyond 300 kHz (+0/−3 dB)**[1]  
- **Equivalent Input Noise (EIN)**: **−133 dB** (60 dB gain, 10 Hz–30 kHz, 150 Ω/common-input)[1]  
- **IMD (50 Hz & 7 kHz)**: **<0.0009%** at 35 dB gain, +27 dBu out[1]  
- **Gain system**: **36 steps / 1.5 dB per step, L/R match 0.08 dB**[2][3]

All values sit well inside widely accepted transparency thresholds (e.g., THD+N ≤0.01%), supporting a measurement-driven “transparent” tier.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

A fully balanced transformerless topology, precision 36-step gain with tight stereo matching, and a laser-trimmed FET output stage are rational design choices aimed squarely at measurable transparency. The implementation quality aligns with the published results, including high headroom and the ability to drive very long lines[1][2][3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Current street price** is **2,250 USD** at multiple U.S. retailers[4][5].

We surveyed lower-priced contenders that meet the **same functions** (dual-channel mic preamp with 48 V phantom, balanced I/O) and **do not underperform** in the **key measurements** most relevant here—especially **EIN around −133 dB** (stated test bandwidth/source) and **THD+N ≤0.001%** under comparable conditions. Representative findings:

- **Millennia HV-32P** (2-ch portable): **EIN −130 dB** (60 dB, 10 Hz–30 kHz, 150 Ω); THD+N <0.001% in specified conditions. **Cheaper** but **noisier** than HV-3C[6][7].  
- **Focusrite ISA Two**: **EIN <−123 dBu**, **THD+N −92 dB (0.0025%)**; practically transparent yet **inferior on noise/THD** vs HV-3C. Priced **899.99 USD**[8][9].  
- **Lake People F355**: **EIN −129 dB**, **THD+N <0.001%**; **inferior on EIN**[10].  
- **Forssell SMP-2**: **EIN ~−130 dBu (typ.)**; broadly comparable but generally **more expensive** than HV-3C[11].

**Conclusion:** As of the review date, we could not identify any **cheaper** product that is **equal or better** in both functions and the above **measurement criteria**. Therefore, by definition the **CP score is 1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The chassis, power supply, switching hardware, and internal wiring (e.g., Mogami Neglex) indicate long-term reliability. While a smaller manufacturer may imply a more limited service footprint by region, the brand’s long presence in pro markets and robust build inspire confidence for studio duty[3].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The product prioritizes measurable transparency (very low THD+N, very low EIN, wide bandwidth, high CMRR, precise gain matching). Given that **no cheaper unit currently matches these measurements without concessions**, the design choices read as technically rational rather than gratuitous.

## Advice

- **Best for**: classical/acoustic main pairs, SFX/foley capture, and any session where **measured top-tier transparency** is a hard requirement.  
- **Alternatives**: If “good-enough transparency” suffices, options like **ISA Two** and modern interface pres can deliver excellent results at far lower prices—accepting that EIN/THD will be below HV-3C on paper[8][9].  
- **Bottom line**: If you want the **lowest-compromise, measurement-first** mic pre within its class, HV-3C is the safe pick. If budget is tight, redefine the measurement targets (e.g., accept EIN in the −127 to −129 dB range) and save substantially.
