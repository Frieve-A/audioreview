## Overview

The Chord & Major Classical Major913 is a wired in-ear monitor from Taiwanese manufacturer Chord & Major, specifically marketed for classical music listening[1]. The company positions this IEM as part of their "Tonal Earphone" concept, which offers genre-specific tuning across different musical styles. The Major913 features a rosewood housing with gold-plated connectors and claims "carefully tuned driver" technology for enhanced classical music reproduction.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Classical Major913 provides only basic manufacturer specifications without crucial measurement data such as THD, S/N ratio, or frequency response deviation measurements. The frequency response specification of 20Hz-20kHz provides no information about linearity or deviation levels. No third-party measurements are available from credible sources, and even manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant detailed information. Under these circumstances where Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data, a baseline score of 0.5 is applied per policy guidelines.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The Major913 employs conventional dynamic driver technology with rosewood housing and gold-plated connectors. While the materials may provide aesthetic appeal, they represent no technological advancement over standard IEM construction methods. The product uses mature/outdated technology without modern innovations, follows an analog/mechanical only approach without digital integration, and shows no technical differentiation that would be difficult for competitors to replicate. No evidence exists of significant accumulation of specialized know-how or proprietary patent technology adoption.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Equipped with basic wired stereo audio reproduction and 3.5mm connectivity, the Classical Major913 lacks modern features such as DSP, EQ, wireless connectivity, or active noise cancellation. The Truthear GATE[4] at approximately 20 USD provides equivalent basic functions and superior measured performance including THD≤1%@1kHz 94dB and extended frequency range of 10-45kHz. Based on historical positioning data indicating the Major913 was priced around 60 USD: CP = 20 ÷ 60 = 0.3.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Chord & Major provides a 1-year warranty from date of purchase, which is below the industry standard 2-year average[3]. Support infrastructure is limited to Taiwan-based manufacturer support with a single global service email and 4-week repair/return timeframe. The company offers standard paid manufacturer support but lacks evidence of a global support network or international service centers. Construction appears standard for IEM category with potential cable stress points at common connection areas.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy emphasizes genre-specific tuning without scientific evidence supporting "classical music optimization" claims. Majority of costs are attributed to aesthetic materials such as rosewood wrapping and gold plating rather than measurable performance improvements. The marketing approach uses wine glass analogies rather than engineering-focused development, and no measurement data validates claimed "precise imaging and soundstage" benefits. The conservative analog-only approach avoids adoption of modern digital/software technologies that could provide actual performance benefits.

## Advice

The Classical Major913 represents an outdated approach to IEM design that prioritizes aesthetic materials over measurable performance improvements. Potential purchasers seeking classical music reproduction would obtain superior measured performance and functionality from modern alternatives like the Truthear GATE[4] at significantly lower cost. The lack of measurement data makes objective evaluation impossible, while the premium pricing for conventional technology and aesthetic materials provides poor value proposition. Consider alternatives with published third-party measurements and transparent performance specifications for informed purchasing decisions.
