## Overview

The Telephonics TDH-39P represents the plastic-cased evolution of the industry-standard TDH-39 audiometric earphones, serving as the acoustic reference standard for the audiometric industry globally. Telephonics, with over 75 years of experience in audio technology, has established this model as the world's leading audiometric earphone for professional hearing testing applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The TDH-39P demonstrates significant limitations in audio quality metrics. Frequency response is restricted to 100Hz-8kHz, falling well below the 20Hz-20kHz standard and even the 100Hz-16kHz problematic threshold. THD specification of "less than 1%" could approach the 1% level, exceeding the 0.5% problematic threshold for headphones. Sensitivity of 108dB + 4dB SPL at 1kHz falls between problematic and transparent levels. Critical specifications including S/N ratio, dynamic range, IMD, and crosstalk remain unspecified, preventing comprehensive audio quality assessment [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The TDH-39P demonstrates strong technical expertise through decades of specialized audiometric development and industry-standard positioning that competitors reference. The dynamic receiver with metal diaphragm represents mature, proven technology optimized for medical applications. However, the design lacks modern digital integration and relies primarily on analog/mechanical approaches. Telephonics' 75+ years of accumulated know-how and established market leadership provide significant competitive advantages, though the technology base remains fundamentally unchanged from earlier generations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The TDH-39P at 123 USD provides equivalent-or-better performance compared to alternatives through ANSI S-3.6 1989 compliance, identical 100Hz-8kHz frequency response, identical 10-ohm impedance, and superior 108dB + 4dB SPL sensitivity versus the RadioEar DD45's 106.7dB sensitivity. Both products offer <1% THD specifications, with the DD45 specifying "below 1% at 120dB SPL" compared to TDH-39P's "less than 1%" specification. The RadioEar DD45 at CHF 475.00 (approximately 595 USD) provides functionally equivalent audiometric capability but with measurably inferior sensitivity performance [4]. No cheaper equivalent-or-better alternatives exist in the current market, resulting in CP = 1.0. This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The TDH-39P exhibits excellent long-term reliability through simple, robust construction with minimal moving parts and metal diaphragm design inherently resistant to degradation. Telephonics maintains a 75+ year track record of products lasting decades in professional medical environments. Support infrastructure includes global manufacturer backing, free telephonic technical support beyond the 90-day warranty period, and established parts supply networks. Recent TTM Technologies acquisition (2022) maintains continuity of support services.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates high rationality through measurement-focused scientific approach specifically targeting medical audiometric applications. ANSI S-3.6 1989 compliance ensures objective performance standards without subjective or unmeasurable claims. Cost structure appropriately reflects specialized medical device requirements where reliability and measurement accuracy justify expense. Conservative approach prioritizes proven technology over innovation, suitable for critical medical applications. Functional integration provides clear justification as purpose-built specialized equipment for clinical environments.

## Advice

For audiometric testing applications requiring ANSI compliance and industry-standard compatibility, the TDH-39P offers unmatched cost-performance and reliability. The 108dB + 4dB SPL sensitivity advantage over competitors like the RadioEar DD45 (106.7dB) provides superior measurement capability at significantly lower cost. However, those seeking general audio listening quality should consider alternatives, as the limited 100Hz-8kHz frequency response and potentially high distortion make it unsuitable for music or consumer applications. Medical professionals and audiologists will find this the most economical choice for compliant audiometric testing equipment.
