## Overview

The Kinera Celest Plutus Beast is a three-driver tribrid IEM that combines a customized bone-conduction unit, a balanced armature, and Kinera’s second-gen SPD (square planar) driver. Official specs list 8 Ω impedance, 108 dB sensitivity, and a 20 Hz–20 kHz response, packaged with a 5N silver-plated copper cable and 2-pin connectors [1]. Street price in the U.S. sits at **89 USD** from authorized retailers [2]. While the configuration is ambitious for the sub-100 USD bracket, real-world behavior exposes design weaknesses that affect basic usability.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Independent reviews consistently report a **ringing/resonance** that is triggered by minor bumps and even the wearer’s **own voice** (male speech especially), attributed to the contact-type bone-conduction driver coupling into the shell/ear [3]. Similar sensitivity to physical vibration (e.g., coughing, handling) is reported elsewhere [4]. Manufacturer specs (8 Ω, 108 dB; 20 Hz–20 kHz) are ordinary and provide no tolerance band for frequency-response deviation [1]. Reference Audio Analyzer lists the Plutus Beast as tested on an **IEC-711 coupler** (report dated 2025-03-27), indicating third-party measurement exists even though detailed public plots are limited [5]. As of August 19, 2025 we found **no credible third-party THD/IMD or isolation numbers** for this model. Given the documented resonance artifact—an audible defect in normal use—the scientific validity score is penalized.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

At this price, a 1 BC + 1 BA + 1 SPD tribrid with a custom 10 mm contact-type bone-conduction driver is technically adventurous, and the accessory/cable package is above average for the segment [1]. However, the execution appears insufficiently isolated/damped around the BC element, allowing mechanical excitation to leak into audible ringing in everyday scenarios [3][4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Target price:** 89 USD [2].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative (user-visible functions & measured performance):** **Truthear x Crinacle Zero: BLUE2** at **64.99 USD** from a major retailer [6]. BLUE2 is a wired IEM offering the same core function (music playback via passive in-ear transducers) with **frequency response that tracks modern targets closely** on a B&K 5128 rig (public database) [7], and it does not exhibit the Plutus Beast’s BC-induced resonance problem reported by multiple reviews [3][4].  

Computed CP (per site rules) rounds to **0.7**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Kinera states a **1-year warranty** for IEMs and standard return terms via its official site [1]. Construction (3D-printed resin shells, 0.78 mm 2-pin) is typical for the class [1]. Lack of long-term failure-rate data and the BC driver’s noted mechanical sensitivity temper the score [3][4].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Integrating bone conduction at low cost is noteworthy, but the implementation appears to **undervalue isolation/damping** essentials for contact-type transducers. The recurring resonance behavior under normal use suggests design priorities favored novelty over robust acoustical control, reducing the rationality of the approach [3][4].

## Advice

For a reliable sub-100 USD pick with objectively safer tuning, choose **Truthear x Crinacle Zero: BLUE2 (64.99 USD)**—it aligns well to target FR on a 5128 rig and avoids the Plutus Beast’s resonance liability [6][7][3]. If you specifically want a Kinera/Celest style build and accessories, confirm your **own-voice/handling** tolerance in person before purchase; the resonance reports are not unit-isolated [3][4].
