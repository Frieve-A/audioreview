## Overview

The Kinera Celest Wyvern (aka “Wyvern Black/Abyss”) is a single-dynamic IEM using a 10 mm LCP diaphragm and is **tuned to the 2019 Harman target** per the maker. It comes in resin shells with detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable and sells around **30 USD** in the US market. Variants include a slightly costlier “Pro/Remaster” edition; this review covers the base Wyvern Black/Abyss. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs list 20 Hz–20 kHz response, 32 Ω impedance, and 105 dB sensitivity. Independent FR sets (IEC60318-4 couplers) show a Harman-like bass shelf and upper-midrise but **audibly relevant treble roll-off past ~7–8 kHz**, so it does not achieve transparent-class flatness across the band. Within the midband it broadly tracks target, while upper treble deviates beyond the ±1 dB “excellent” envelope and edges toward the ±3 dB “standard” band typical for budget IEMs. Staging/separation are average for a single DD at this price. [1][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The LCP diaphragm and decent magnetic circuit are solid but **conventional** in 2024–2025 budget IEMs. Build uses 3D-printed resin and standard 2-pin wiring; no crossover/DSP or novel acoustic structures are present beyond tuning filters. This is a competent but unremarkable implementation. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Price basis (US):** Wyvern Black 30 USD (representative current price). **Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **Moondrop CHU II at 22.99 USD** with closer-to-target FR on multiple independent rigs and similarly low distortion claims; functionality (wired single-DD with detachable 2-pin) is equivalent.  
**Calculation:** 22.99 USD ÷ 30 USD = **0.766… → 0.8** (rounded to the first decimal).  
Rationale: CHU II’s FR adherence (VDSF/Harman-aligned) is at least as good and often better in the treble region; no cheaper model we could verify meets or exceeds Wyvern’s measured fidelity while matching user-visible functions. [1][2][5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Kinera lists a **1-year warranty** for IEMs; support is typically via retailers (Linsoul/HiFiGo/ShenzhenAudio). Resin shells and budget cables are serviceable but not as robust as metal builds; spare parts (tips/filters/cables) are widely available. Overall, average coverage and expected durability for the price. [3][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Chasing the Harman target at entry-level pricing is **sound and measurement-oriented**, but execution falls short of “transparent-class” results due to treble roll-off and average technicalities. Pricing is fair; engineering choices are reasonable but not notably innovative. [1][4]

## Advice

If you want a Harman-style tonality and a lightweight resin fit around **30 USD**, Wyvern is a fine, easy listen with forgiving treble. If you prioritize **measured neutrality per target** and extension, consider **Moondrop CHU II (~22.99 USD)** as the stronger all-rounder at lower cost. If you specifically prefer softer highs, Wyvern’s roll-off can be an advantage for fatigue-sensitive listening. [5][6]
