## Overview

The Kinera Celest Phoenixcall is a tribrid in-ear monitor with five drivers per side: one 7 mm dynamic, two balanced armatures, and two micro planar “flat panel” drivers for ultra-highs. Official specs list 20 Hz–40 kHz response, 103 dB sensitivity, 32 Ω impedance, and a 0.78 mm 2-pin detachable cable [1]. Originally 129 USD MSRP, it is currently listed at 119.99 USD on Kinera’s store (rounded here to 120 USD) [2]. *Compatibility note:* shells are on the larger side; shallow insertion can tilt treble—narrow-bore or foam tips often help maintain balance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent frequency-response measurements show a mild V-shape (elevated bass and treble, recessed mids) consistent across third-party rigs, aligning with the product’s “bright with deep bass” positioning [1][3][7]. That tuning is not transparent to the source but is acceptable for general listening. No reliable third-party THD dataset for Phoenixcall was found; absent contrary data, we do not assume inaudible distortion. Overall, measured FR behavior supports a mid-pack fidelity score at this price.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A 5-driver tribrid at this price demonstrates moderate sophistication. The inclusion of dedicated micro planar super-tweeters (marketed as SPD 3.0/FPD) is uncommon under ~150 USD, though audible benefit above 20 kHz is doubtful. Execution relies on standard parts; crossover/phase integration quality is undocumented. Materials and modular 2-pin cabling are conventional but practical. Net: some novelty in topology, otherwise typical implementation. [1][7]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **7HZ x Crinacle Zero:2** at **24.99 USD** (regular price; detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin). It offers equivalent user-facing functions (wired IEM, detachable cable) and *equal-or-better measured performance* in key axes: (a) FR alignment to modern targets is closer than Phoenixcall per public overlays [4], and (b) independent lab testing reports **negligible distortion even at 114 dB SPL**, indicating very low THD in practical use [5]. Price basis: Linsoul regular price 24.99 USD [6]. **CP calculation:** 24.99 USD ÷ 120 USD = **0.208** → **0.2** (rounded to one decimal).  
*Result:* Phoenixcall’s CP is poor against today’s best budget performers.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

One-year warranty is typical via dealers; no published MTBF/failure-rate data. Resin shells and standard 0.78 mm 2-pin cabling aid repairability, but multi-driver complexity adds potential failure points vs single-DD designs. Support quality varies by region. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Marketing emphasis on response to 40 kHz and super-tweeter drivers does not map to audible improvements for human listeners. Complexity (five drivers, multi-way crossover) lacks publicly shown benefits over simpler designs that measure closer to neutral. Investment appears directed to cosmetics/theme and driver count rather than verified audible transparency. [1][7]

## Advice

If you enjoy an energetic V-shape with strong bass sparkle and appreciate the aesthetics, Phoenixcall can be satisfying at around 120 USD. If you prioritize fidelity per measurements, start with **7HZ Zero:2** (~25 USD) for greater accuracy per dollar, or consider **Truthear Zero:RED** (~55 USD) if you prefer a slightly warmer, target-centric tuning with abundant third-party data.
