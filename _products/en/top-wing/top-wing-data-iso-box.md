## Overview

The Top Wing Data ISO Box is a 5-port gigabit network switch priced at 55,000 JPY. It claims to create a "quiet network space for music" by physically isolating audio equipment from the home network. The device features a business-grade CPU and SK Hynix memory in a compact 128×86×34mm enclosure. However, there is no scientific basis for the claim that network isolation improves sound quality in digital audio transmission.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

There is no scientific evidence to support the claim of sound quality improvement through network isolation as asserted by this product. In digital audio streaming, standard protocols like TCP/IP have error-correction mechanisms that ensure data is transferred accurately. Other traffic on the network theoretically cannot alter the data content and its potential impact on sound quality is negligible. Therefore, the concept of a "quiet network space" is meaningless from an audio engineering perspective.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

On the hardware side, the use of a business-grade CPU and SK Hynix memory suggests higher reliability than typical consumer-grade network devices. The 5-port configuration (3 for audio devices, 1 for a wireless AP, 1 for an upstream router) allows for port separation by use case. It is fully equipped with standard gigabit switch functions, including 1000/100/10Mbps auto-negotiation. However, the product's core technology remains within the scope of existing network switch technology, showing no originality or technical innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

5-port gigabit switches with equivalent basic functionality, such as the TP-Link TL-SG105 or NETGEAR GS105, are available starting in the 3,000 JPY price range. There is no factor in basic data transfer performance that justifies the price of 55,000 JPY. No performance advantage can be identified that rationally explains a price difference of more than 18 times for the added value of being "audio-dedicated."

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The 12-month warranty period is standard for the industry. While the use of business-grade components may contribute to reliability, the company is an emerging enterprise, leaving uncertainties regarding its long-term support structure and stability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design philosophy of improving sound quality through network isolation lacks a scientific basis and any data showing measurable improvement effects. In digital audio, under a properly designed network environment, the impact of other traffic on sound quality is theoretically negligible. While the function of separating IoT devices is meaningful from a network management perspective, the logic connecting this to sound quality improvement is unscientific. A more rational approach would be to invest the same budget in higher-performance DACs, amplifiers, or digital signal processing technology.

## Advice

For those considering this product, it is recommended to first try the equivalent basic functionality with a generic 5-port gigabit switch like the TP-Link TL-SG105, which costs in the 3,000 JPY range. If seeking to improve sound quality in network audio, allocating the 55,000 JPY budget to upgrading scientifically-grounded equipment such as a DAC, amplifier, or speakers is extremely likely to yield improvements that are both measurable and audible.
