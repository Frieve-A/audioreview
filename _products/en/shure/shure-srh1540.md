## Overview

The SRH1540 is Shure’s premium closed-back studio headphone. It uses 40 mm neodymium dynamic drivers, aluminum-alloy yokes with carbon-fiber end caps, and plush Alcantara ear pads for comfort and isolation. It targets engineers and creators who want isolation without giving up a generally neutral presentation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent measurements agree on a mostly neutral tuning through the mids into the treble: Sonarworks reports approximately **±3 dB from ~170 Hz to ~17 kHz** (with a ~100 Hz bump below that range) [3]. DIY Audio Heaven notes **bass elevated ~+6 dB** relative to neutral and **energy rolling off above ~12 kHz**—i.e., not perfectly flat end-to-end [1]. More importantly, **3rd-harmonic distortion in the sub-bass is elevated**; DIYAH shows ~**5% THD at 50 Hz**, and Sonarworks flags **high 3rd-harmonic distortion in the lows** that can mask deep-bass detail at higher levels [1][3]. Official specs are **99 dB/mW sensitivity** (≈**112 dB/V**) and **46 Ω** impedance [2]. Net: mid/treble neutrality is strong, but sub-bass THD is a real limitation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Premium materials (aluminum/carbon-fiber), serviceable dual-exit cables, and high-quality pads are well executed. The acoustic approach is conventional dynamic-driver fare with careful tuning rather than novel transducer tech. Solid engineering, not a breakthrough.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**549 USD** current street [5]. The **AKG K371** delivers equal-or-better user-facing performance for monitoring at a far lower price: it closely follows the studio target response and shows **low harmonic distortion** in independent testing [4]. Widely available around **185 USD** new at authorized dealers [6].  
**CP = 185 USD ÷ 549 USD = 0.34 → 0.3** (rounded to one decimal). Given SRH1540’s sub-bass THD and the K371’s measured neutrality/low THD, SRH1540’s value is weak.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Shure provides a **two-year limited warranty** on SRH1540 with global service infrastructure [7]. Build is robust and pads/cables are replaceable. Warranty length is industry-average; support breadth and construction quality justify a modest bump above 0.5.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Pursuing a neutral studio response with premium comfort is rational. However, charging a large premium without commensurate improvements versus cheaper, well-measured competitors (and with known low-end THD) limits the rationale from a measurement-first standpoint.

## Advice

If you need **closed-back, neutral monitoring** on a budget, prioritize the **AKG K371**: it tracks a reference target well and maintains low distortion for roughly a third of the price [4][6]. Choose the SRH1540 if you specifically want its **comfort, build, and accessories** and you don’t work in **sub-bass-critical** contexts.
