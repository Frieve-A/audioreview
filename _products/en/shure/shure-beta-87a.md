## Overview

The Shure Beta 87A is a premium supercardioid handheld electret condenser vocal microphone designed for professional sound reinforcement, broadcasting, and studio recording applications. Introduced as part of Shure's Beta series, it combines the sensitivity and detail of condenser technology with the ruggedness required for touring and field production. The microphone features exceptionally smooth frequency response with gradual presence rise, advanced cartridge shock-mount system, and built-in three-stage pop filter. With its tight supercardioid polar pattern providing null points at approximately 125 degrees, the Beta 87A offers maximum isolation from other vocalists or instruments while maintaining minimal off-axis coloration. The microphone incorporates electronic low-frequency roll-off to compensate for proximity effect and prevent boomy sound characteristics associated with close pickup.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Beta 87A demonstrates problematic measured performance in critical scientific validity benchmarks. Self-noise performance of 23.5 dB A-weighted exceeds the problematic threshold of 20 dB-A for professional microphones, creating audible noise floor issues that compromise recording applications [1][2]. Signal-to-noise ratio of 70.5 dB falls significantly below transparent levels (80 dB threshold) but remains above problematic levels (60 dB), indicating suboptimal noise performance [2]. Maximum SPL capability of 140.5 dB (0.25% THD, 1000 ohm load) meets excellent threshold requirements for professional applications [1][2]. Dynamic range specification of 117 dB exceeds transparent performance levels (105 dB threshold), providing excellent headroom [2]. Frequency response of 50 Hz to 20 kHz with presence peak at 10 kHz falls within acceptable deviation ranges for vocal applications [1][2]. However, the problematic self-noise performance significantly impacts scientific validity, particularly for studio recording applications where noise floor becomes audible, placing the microphone below average performance standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Beta 87A represents solid implementation of established electret condenser technology without breakthrough innovations. The microphone features 6-micron gold-sputtered diaphragm and supercardioid electret condenser design, representing appropriate contemporary technology for professional applications [3]. Advanced cartridge shock-mount system and built-in three-stage pop filter demonstrate effective mechanical engineering solutions [1][3]. Construction utilizes enamel-coated metal alloy body with steel mesh grille for durability in professional environments [3]. The in-house Shure design reflects established microphone expertise and proven acoustic principles. However, the technology implementation lacks proprietary patent innovations or cutting-edge advancements that would distinguish it significantly from competitive products. The purely analog technology approach without digital integration or advanced functional features represents conventional rather than innovative design philosophy. Overall technology level meets industry standards without exceptional differentiation or future-oriented development.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 269 USD, among handheld supercardioid condenser vocal microphones with equal-or-better measured performance and user-facing functions (handheld form factor, XLR, phantom operation), no cheaper equivalent was identified. AKG C7 offers lower self-noise (21 dB-A) and higher max SPL (150 dB) with the same supercardioid pattern but costs 329 USD [6]. Sennheiser e865 provides the same handheld supercardioid condenser functionality at 279 USD with 150 dB max SPL but does not undercut the Beta 87Aâ€™s price [8]. Neumann KMS 105 delivers clearly superior noise performance (18 dB-A) and professional specs at a much higher price point (~744 USD) [7]. Therefore, no cheaper equal-or-better alternative exists at review time; CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Shure provides industry-standard 2-year warranty coverage with established global manufacturer support system and proven repair network [4]. The Beta 87A benefits from robust metal alloy construction with steel mesh grille specifically designed for touring applications and professional field use [3]. The company's rigorous testing philosophy includes extreme temperature and moisture testing to ensure long-term durability [5]. Shure's established reliability track record spanning decades in professional audio applications provides confidence in product longevity, with products frequently remaining in service for extended periods. The global support infrastructure exceeds typical dealer-based service models, though repair turnaround time averages two weeks with no advance replacement program available [4]. Customer experiences indicate potential for refurbished unit replacements rather than new units for defective products [4]. The combination of robust construction, established warranty support, and proven reliability history provides above-average confidence despite some service limitations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Shure demonstrates rational engineering-focused design philosophy with measurement-based approach to acoustic optimization and systematic development processes. The company emphasizes mathematical foundations and scientific principles in product development, utilizing early prototyping and iterative testing methodologies [5]. Design costs directly contribute to functional performance through advanced shock mounting, effective pop filtering, and durable construction suited to professional applications. The systematic engineering approach with rigorous testing under extreme conditions reflects rational development philosophy focused on practical user benefits rather than marketing-driven features. However, the conservative technology approach lacks integration of modern digital processing, advanced materials, or contemporary functional enhancements that could provide meaningful performance improvements. The emphasis on traditional analog technology without exploration of innovative approaches limits the forward-looking aspects of the design philosophy. Overall, the rational scientific approach to engineering combined with cost-effective durability focus demonstrates sound design philosophy within conventional technology boundaries.

## Advice

Within handheld supercardioid condenser microphones, the Beta 87A is currently the lowest-priced option among equal-function peers (e.g., e865 at 279 USD, AKG C7 at 329 USD), yielding CP=1.0. That said, scientific validity remains limited by self-noise, which constrains studio applications where noise floor audibility matters. If you need a handheld supercardioid for live stages and tight feedback control at minimal cost, the Beta 87A is rational. If you prioritize lower noise for critical recording, consider higher-tier handheld condensers (e.g., Neumann KMS 105) at a substantially higher price, or pivot to non-handheld studio condensers when handheld use is not required.
