## Overview

The Shure SM86 is a cardioid condenser vocal microphone designed for professional live performance. It pairs a small-diaphragm condenser capsule with a rugged handheld body, incorporating a built-in three-point shock mount and a two-stage pop filter. It targets performers who prefer condenser clarity on stage where dynamic microphones often dominate.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specifications report a 50Hz–18kHz frequency response with a presence rise in the 2–5kHz region, maximum SPL handling of 147dB (at 1% THD, 1kHz), self-noise of 23dB A-weighted, S/N of 71dB at 94dB SPL, and dynamic range of 124dB [1]. Independent lab measurements suitable for meta-analysis were not located at review time; therefore, these values are treated as manufacturer specs pending third-party verification. The 18kHz upper limit falls short of full 20kHz coverage, and missing figures for IMD/crosstalk constrain a holistic assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The SM86 uses proven small-diaphragm condenser topology with a standard cardioid pattern, integrated shock mounting, and dual-layer pop filtering for stage practicality. Phantom power (11–52V DC) is required per the spec [1]. Implementation meets contemporary expectations for handheld condensers without notable advances beyond established practice.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Current market price is 209 USD for SM86 [2][3]. Audio-Technica AT2010 is a handheld cardioid condenser with extended 40Hz–20kHz response and a 16mm low-mass diaphragm (official) at 139 USD [4][5]. While SM86 offers higher max SPL (147dB vs 136dB), both deliver professional live vocal capability; AT2010’s measured-spec parity on core user axes (pattern, bandwidth) justifies using it as the cheapest equal-or-better comparator.  
**CP calculation:** 139 USD ÷ 209 USD = 0.665 → **0.7** after rounding [2][4][5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Wired Shure microphones generally carry a 2-year limited warranty, with established global service pathways including factory repair programs [6][7]. The SM86’s metal construction and shock mounting are appropriate for touring use. No firmware applies. Overall support/warranty is industry-average; thus the neutral score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Shure’s approach—stage-ready ruggedization around a condenser capsule—addresses a real use-case (condenser clarity on loud stages) without speculative claims. Choices emphasize reliability and intelligibility but do not push measured transparency boundaries beyond typical handheld condensers.

## Advice

If you need condenser articulation on stage and can supply stable phantom power, SM86 remains a sensible pick. Budget-conscious buyers should check AT2010 at 139 USD, which offers comparable functionality at a lower price [4][5]. If maximal robustness and simplicity are priorities, a dynamic like SM58 may be preferable. Verify your mixer/interface provides compliant phantom power before purchase.
