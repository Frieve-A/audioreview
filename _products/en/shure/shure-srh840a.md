## Overview

The Shure SRH840A is a closed-back headphone designed for professional studio monitoring applications. It features 40mm neodymium dynamic drivers with a stated frequency response of 5Hz to 25kHz. From the previous SRH840 model, improvements have been made for practical use, including reducing impedance from 44Ω to 38Ω and adjusting sensitivity from 102dB/mW to 97dB SPL/mW. The design incorporates a detachable cable system, emphasizing convenience for studio work. As a product from Shure, a veteran professional audio manufacturer, it maintains a certain level of recognition and reliability in the industry.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

There are significant concerns regarding measurement performance. Shure's official specifications do not disclose total harmonic distortion (THD) values, lacking the objective data fundamental to scientific evaluation. While the frequency response covers a wide range of 5Hz to 25kHz, the absence of specific deviation values (±dB) makes it difficult to assess transparency levels. According to third-party measurement organization DIY Audio Heaven, "distortion is minimal at moderate volumes but increases rapidly when volume is raised," suggesting performance limitations at high volumes. The specifications of 38Ω impedance and 97dB SPL/mW sensitivity fall within typical ranges, but it remains unclear whether they reach the transparency levels outlined in measurement result criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Technically, this represents industry-standard level design. The 40mm neodymium dynamic drivers employ conventional technology with no notable uniqueness or advancement. The detachable cable system is practical but not innovative. The impedance change from the previous model (44Ω→38Ω) is a practical improvement but not fundamental technological progress. The closed-back design also follows conventional approaches, with no confirmed new acoustic engineering initiatives. While the design philosophy is solid, no proprietary or patent technologies that other companies would envy have been identified.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Against the official price of 149 USD (approximately 147 USD), the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x with equivalent functionality is available for 99 USD (approximately 100 USD). The ATH-M40x matches basic specifications including 40mm drivers, a closed-back design, detachable cables, and professional monitoring applications, making it a viable alternative from the user's perspective. Cost-performance calculation: 99 USD ÷ 149 USD = 0.66, evaluated as 0.7. Improved price competitiveness is required.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Shure boasts high reliability as a veteran professional audio manufacturer founded in 1925. It maintains a global sales network and support system with extensive experience in professional equipment. While the product warranty period is industry-standard, the brand's reliability provides substantial peace of mind. Although specific failure rate data is not published, continued usage in professional markets serves as evidence of quality. Repair systems and after-sales service are well-established, evaluated as above industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design approach is conservative yet rational. The focus on professional monitoring applications is clear, and the design philosophy emphasizing practical use in studio work is understandable. However, the non-disclosure of measurement data and insufficient presentation of scientific evidence leave room for improvement from a modern transparency perspective. While basic functional requirements are met through a closed-back design for sound isolation and detachable cables for convenience, innovative initiatives for sound quality improvement are limited. The approach remains within the scope of solid utilization of existing technologies, with room for performance improvement through more scientific approaches.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the Shure SRH840A, careful comparison with competitors in the same price range is recommended. Particularly, the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x (approximately 100 USD) offers equivalent functionality at a significantly lower price, making it a priority consideration for budget-conscious buyers. Conversely, if you value Shure brand reliability and long-term support systems with sufficient budget, it can be a viable option. However, it's important to understand that the lack of measurement data makes scientific sound quality evaluation difficult. For professional applications, actual testing in usage environments is strongly recommended, particularly verification of distortion characteristics at high volumes. For those prioritizing cost-performance above all, considering the more affordable alternative product would be prudent.
