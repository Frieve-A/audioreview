## Overview

The SRH440A is Shure’s 2022 refresh of its entry studio monitor headphone. It’s a closed-back, circumaural model with 40 mm dynamic neodymium drivers, a detachable 3 m locking (2.5 mm bayonet) straight cable, and a fold-flat mechanism. Shure positions it for podcasting, home recording, and editing/mixing, with a neutral, uncolored tuning focus. [2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Key facts from credible sources:

- **Manufacturer specs** (SRH440A): 40 Ω impedance @1 kHz, 97 dB/mW sensitivity, 10 Hz–22 kHz response, 268 g weight. [1]  
- **Independent measurements** (DIY-Audio-Heaven): excellent channel matching; bass extension to **8 Hz (−3 dB)**, a mild mid-bass lift around ~150 Hz, and a treble peak near **9 kHz**; **sensitivity 119 dB/V @1 kHz**; measured weight ~**273 g**; clamp force ~**3 N**. Some **compression below ~150 Hz** appears from ~85 dB SPL, implying rising bass distortion at louder levels; overall “isolation is not great” for a closed headphone. [2]

Taken together, SRH440A’s frequency response is generally within a few dB of a neutral target through much of the band but has a notable 9 kHz emphasis. The bass compression at high SPLs and the modest isolation are typical for the class and price. These data support a **moderate** scientific performance score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Conventional 40 mm dynamic drivers in a standard closed-back shell, executed competently but without novel transducer tech or enclosure breakthroughs. The 2022 refresh improves build/comfort and keeps a practical, serviceable design (detachable locking cable, foldable hinges). This is an incremental update rather than a technical leap. [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Current market price (U.S.)** as of Aug 15, 2025:
- Shure **SRH440A**: **109 USD** (B&H).  
- **Cheapest equal-or-better comparator**: **Audio-Technica ATH-M40x** at **109 USD** (B&H).

**Why ATH-M40x qualifies (equivalent class & measurements):** closed-back 40 mm dynamic monitor with low measured distortion (**<1% in bass** on the tested unit) and broadly comparable response deviations for monitoring use; detachable cables and similar studio feature set. [4][5][6]

No cheaper product with clearly **equal-or-better measured performance** and equivalent user-facing functions was found in the U.S. market. Therefore, CP is set to **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Shure includes a **limited 2-year warranty** and supplies replaceable parts (locking cable, adapter). The construction is mostly plastic but serviceable; the detachable bayonet cable aids longevity. Warranty term is confirmed on Shure’s official pages/product materials. [2][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design intent—neutral monitoring first, looks second—is rational for studio tasks. The trade-offs (slightly sharp upper-treble, moderate isolation) are transparent in measurements and align with the target use case. There’s no “mystique” tech; just practical, measurement-led tuning and serviceable hardware. [2]

## Advice

If you want a neutral-leaning, serviceable studio headphone around this price, SRH440A is a valid choice. If you prefer an alternative at the **same** price with similarly strong measurement pedigree and a richer cable kit, consider **ATH-M40x**. If you need stronger out-of-box isolation or a softer treble, you may want to look higher up the line (budget permitting).
