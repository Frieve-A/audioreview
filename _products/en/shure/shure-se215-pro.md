## Overview

The Shure SE215 Pro is an entry-level professional in-ear monitor from Shure, the venerable American audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1925. Shure has established a long history and reputation in the industry for microphones and audio equipment. The SE215 Pro features professional specifications including detachable MMCX cables and Sound Isolating technology for noise isolation, designed for stage monitoring applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This product's scientific value lies in its exceptional passive noise isolation, rated at 37dB. This far exceeds the ideal level in our measurement standards and effectively reduces noise reaching the eardrum in loud environments. However, it has serious problems from a sound fidelity perspective. Measurement data shows its frequency response deviates significantly from the standard benchmark of ±3dB across 20Hz-20kHz. The high frequencies, in particular, roll off sharply above 10kHz, resulting in a significant loss of information present in the master recording. Therefore, despite its excellent isolation, its scientific validity in terms of faithful sound reproduction must be rated as low.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The SE215 Pro achieves industry-leading 37dB noise isolation using a basic single dynamic driver configuration, combined with a unique housing design and eartips. The technical implementation to achieve this isolation at this price point is commendable. However, its technical limitations in sound quality are clear. The single-driver configuration lags significantly behind modern multi-BA driver or hybrid configurations in the same price range, especially in high-frequency reproduction capabilities. While the detachable MMCX cable is practical, the core acoustic performance shows its age, placing the overall technology level only slightly above average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Comparing the SE215 Pro's market price of approximately 92 USD, it is the cheapest product that meets equivalent specifications. This evaluation is based on a comparison among products that satisfy the criteria of "MMCX compatibility," "in-ear monitor," and "rated 37dB noise isolation." For example, the Etymotic ER3XR (approx. 153 USD) offers similar isolation but at a higher price. Therefore, the calculation "92 USD ÷ 92 USD = 1.0" results in a score of 1.0. However, it's crucial to note that this rating focuses on the specific feature of extremely high noise isolation and would not hold if overall performance, including sound fidelity, were considered.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Shure brand is highly regarded in the industry for its reliability, backed by a 2-year warranty and a well-established repair system. The detachable cable with MMCX connectors is a practical feature, allowing for easy replacement in case of cable failure and promoting long-term use. The company's long-standing reputation in the professional market ensures a certain level of reliability in build quality and quality control. For a product in this price range, the support system is above the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design philosophy of the SE215 Pro is highly focused on a single purpose: on-stage monitoring, for which it pursues the essential feature of high noise isolation. In this respect, its objective is clear. However, to achieve this goal, it makes a significant sacrifice in what should be the most fundamental aspect of an audio product: fidelity to the master recording. The acoustic design, which deviates drastically from a flat frequency response, cannot be considered rational for many applications. While it meets a specific niche demand, it abandons the broader goal of high-fidelity reproduction, leading to a low rating for the rationality of its design philosophy.

## Advice

The SE215 Pro is a highly specialized product for professional applications such as stage monitoring or for use in extremely noisy environments like construction sites, where isolating specific sounds is critical. Its exceptional 37dB rated noise isolation is a clear advantage that is hard to find in other products. However, for the purpose of music enjoyment, especially for users who want to faithfully reproduce the information recorded in the source material, it is not recommended at all. The significantly colored frequency response will alter the impression of most music. You should only consider purchasing this product if your use case absolutely prioritizes noise isolation over sound quality.
