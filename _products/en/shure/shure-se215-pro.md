## Overview

The Shure SE215 Pro is an entry-level professional in-ear monitor from Shure, the venerable American audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1925. Shure has established a long history and reputation in the industry for microphones and audio equipment. The SE215 Pro features professional specifications including detachable MMCX cables and Sound Isolating technology for noise isolation, designed for stage monitoring applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The SE215 Pro's greatest scientific value lies in its 37dB isolation performance. According to the measurement baseline standards, passive isolation performance above 25dB is considered excellent, and 37dB represents extremely superior performance far exceeding the transparent level. As a professional IEM, it demonstrates scientifically proven effectiveness in noisy environments. The 17ฮฉ impedance and 107 dB SPL/mW sensitivity are standard, with frequency response showing warm tonal characteristics, but the scientific superiority of isolation performance forms the core product value.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The SE215 Pro achieves above-industry-average technical implementation in realizing 37dB isolation performance. While the single dynamic driver configuration represents basic design, the combination with specialized housing design and dedicated ear tips successfully achieves 37dB isolation performance far exceeding the transparent level (30dB+), representing commendable technical implementation. The detachable MMCX cable system, combined with the comprehensive technical package achieving 37dB isolation performance at this price point, demonstrates technical superiority. Compared to competing products achieving equivalent performance only at higher prices, the cost-effective technical implementation shows good technical level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The SE215 Pro's Japanese market price is approximately 13,860 yen, and it represents the world's cheapest product meeting equivalent functionality (MMCX detachable cable, in-ear IEM design, 37dB isolation performance). The competing Etymotic ER3XR costs 23,000 yen, while the KZ ZS10 Pro offers only 26dB isolation performance, falling short of the SE215 Pro's 37dB. Among products satisfying equivalent functionality, the SE215 Pro represents the lowest price point. CP = 13,860 yen รท 13,860 yen = 1.0. As a product featuring MMCX detachable cables, professional IEM functionality, and 37dB isolation performance far exceeding the transparent level, its price competitiveness reaches maximum level.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Shure brand maintains high industry evaluation for reliability, with established 2-year warranty and comprehensive repair infrastructure. The detachable MMCX cable system enables replacement during cable failure, ensuring practical usability for long-term use. As a venerable audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1925, the technical background and professional market track record provide reliability in product quality consistency and durability. Due to wired product nature, firmware updates are unnecessary, enabling simple and reliable operation. Compared to same-price products, brand reliability and support infrastructure demonstrate superiority.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The SE215 Pro's design philosophy specializes in achieving 37dB isolation performance but shows technical limitations with single dynamic driver configuration. While achieving excellent isolation performance (30dB+) and providing professional application value, the Etymotic ER3XR achieves superior frequency response with balanced armature technology at equivalent isolation levels. MMCX detachable cables and robust housing design are commendable, but overall design philosophy remains at moderate rationality considering room for improvement in technical approach. The specialization for isolation performance has merit, but comprehensive design philosophy evaluation shows mixed rational and limiting aspects.

## Advice

The SE215 Pro is strongly recommended for applications requiring 37dB isolation performance. As a professional IEM, its scientifically proven excellent isolation performance provides irreplaceable value in stage monitoring, noisy work environments, and focused work situations. Same-price products achieving this isolation performance level are extremely limited, making it a rational choice for specialized applications. Even for general music listening purposes, it offers consideration value for users prioritizing isolation performance. Before purchase, evaluate the necessity of 37dB high isolation performance - if this performance is important, it comes with strong recommendation. For pure sound quality focus, consider other alternatives.
