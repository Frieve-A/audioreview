rating: [2.7, 0.3, 0.4, 0.9, 0.6, 0.5]
summary: "Single dynamic IEM with excellent passive isolation and a warm tuning. While its frequency response is scientifically problematic, value is reasonable when compared against equally isolating competitors like Etymotic’s ER2 series."

## Overview

The Shure SE215 has long served as an entry point into professional in-ear monitoring. It features up to **37 dB** of passive noise reduction, detachable **MMCX** cables, and a warm, bass-enhanced signature. However, its measured fidelity lags behind modern competitors.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Independent measurements report **boomy/cluttered bass–mids** and **mostly recessed treble with sharp peaks**[1]. Reference Audio Analyzer likewise shows deviations exceeding **±3 dB** across much of the band[2]. By contrast, the **37 dB** passive isolation is genuinely excellent and a key strength[3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A conventional single dynamic MicroDriver and detachable MMCX connectors are used. With **17 Ω** impedance and **107 dB SPL/mW** sensitivity, it is easy to drive[3]. Mechanical design is robust, but the acoustic implementation shows little technical novelty.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Street price is about **109 USD** (Sweetwater)[7]. Among models with **equal-or-better passive isolation** (35–42 dB) and **detachable MMCX**, **Etymotic ER2 series** is cheaper and measurably more neutral: **ER2XR** at **102.01 USD** (Sweetwater) [6] and **ER2SE** at **104.99 USD** during the official store promotion (through Aug 31, 2025) [4]. Within the **high-isolation IEM** constraint, SE215’s value is therefore **fair**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Shure provides a 2-year warranty and established global parts support. The detachable cable lets you replace the most failure-prone component, and the housing has proven durable in pro use[7].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Prioritizing isolation and durability makes sense for stage monitoring, but the tuning departs from measured neutrality. It’s practical for noisy environments, less so for high-fidelity home listening.

## Advice

If you need **maximum isolation** and **ruggedness**, the SE215 remains viable.  
If you want **similar or better isolation** but a more **neutral** sound, prioritize **Etymotic ER2XR/ER2SE** (35–42 dB isolation, MMCX)[4][5]. For listeners who don’t require strong isolation, many lower-priced IEMs deliver higher measured fidelity.
