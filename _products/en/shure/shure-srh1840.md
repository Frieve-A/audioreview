## Overview

The Shure SRH1840 are professional open-back headphones featuring individually matched 40 mm neodymium drivers for mastering and critical listening. Their open-back design targets natural sound with wide stereo imaging. Aircraft-grade aluminum, steel driver frames, and detachable MMCX cables round out a studio-durable build.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Multiple independent measurements paint a consistent picture. Frequency response is very flat roughly from 100 Hz to 7 kHz, but there is a notable ~+6 dB rise around 8–10 kHz [3]. More critically, distortion rises across much of the band: Sonarworks measured distortion “creeping up past 300 Hz” with “massive 3rd harmonic distortion” in the mids at moderate levels [3]. DIY-Audio-Heaven and Reference Audio Analyzer datasets corroborate elevated midband THD compared with modern best-in-class open-backs [1][2]. For critical monitoring transparency, these distortion characteristics are a significant limitation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The SRH1840 uses matched 40 mm drivers, steel driver frames with a vented pole, an aluminum chassis, and detachable MMCX cables—robust but conventional ingredients for this category. Execution quality is high, yet there’s no novel transducer or enclosure tech addressing the documented distortion behavior; implementation remains industry-standard rather than cutting-edge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At 549 USD (street) the SRH1840 is undercut by equal-or-better performers. The Sennheiser **HD 560S** at 199.95 USD (official US store) offers the same user-facing functionality (open-back, wired, studio-fit) with **superior measured performance**: RTINGS shows outstanding harmonic distortion (≈0.05% WHD @ 94 dB SPL; ≈0.21% @ 104 dB) and neutral, reference-leaning response [6]. **CP = 199.95 USD ÷ 549 USD = 0.36 ⇒ score 0.4**.  

(If you prefer a more premium alternative, the HD 600 also maintains excellent THD performance, but it is pricier than the 560S [5].)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Build quality is solid (aluminum/steel, detachable cables, replaceable velour pads) and Shure’s official bundle includes spare pads and a second cable, supporting longevity [4]. Shure provides a **two-year limited warranty** and established global support channels [8]. Parts availability (e.g., HPAEC1840 pads) is good, supporting above-average serviceability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The engineering intent prioritizes flat response and serviceable studio ergonomics—rational goals. However, leaving the midband distortion unaddressed undermines transparency targets. From a fidelity-first perspective, the strategy is sound but the execution falls short versus current best-practice designs that achieve both neutrality **and** very low THD.

## Advice

For transparent critical listening on a budget, **Sennheiser HD 560S** is the obvious pick: open-back, easy to drive, very low distortion, and far cheaper [6][7]. If you want a sturdier build and don’t mind higher cost, **Sennheiser HD 600** remains a benchmark with excellent distortion behavior [5]. Unless you specifically need Shure ecosystem commonality, the SRH1840’s measured-performance-per-dollar is weak.
