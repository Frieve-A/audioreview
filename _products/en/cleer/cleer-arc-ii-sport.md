summary: "Open-ear earbuds with solid build quality but limited scientific validity due to open-ear design compromises; competent connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3, aptX Adaptive/Lossless, LE Audio) and thoughtful extras (UV-C case, head gestures) don’t overcome physics."

## Overview

The Cleer Arc II Sport targets fitness users who want situational awareness while listening. Launched in 2023, these open-ear hook earbuds use a 16.2 mm neodymium dynamic driver and are rated IPX5. Claimed battery life is 35 hours total (8 hours earbuds + 27 hours case). Connectivity is modern: Bluetooth 5.3 with aptX Adaptive and **aptX Lossless**, Multipoint, and **LE Audio** under the Snapdragon Sound umbrella. The case integrates **UV-C light** sterilization, and a 6-axis motion sensor enables head-gesture controls. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Open-ear designs face fundamental acoustic limits: with no ear-canal seal, **low-frequency extension and isolation are inherently poor**. Third-party lab measurements of a comparable open-ear model report **low-frequency extension ≈118 Hz** and **large bass deficits** (e.g., low-bass ≈−37.7 dB vs. target), with **near-zero passive isolation**, which is consistent with the physics of this form factor. [6] For the Arc II Sport specifically, independent reviewers also note that the **ultra-low bass is the primary compromise** of the design. [8] We could not locate credible third-party measurements of THD, crosstalk, or dynamic range for this model. Given these constraints, scientific validity remains limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The implementation is competent and current rather than groundbreaking. Bluetooth 5.3, Multipoint, **LE Audio**, aptX Adaptive/**Lossless**, and Snapdragon Sound are all up-to-date platform features. The 16.2 mm driver is sensibly sized for open-ear beaming. The UV-C case and head-gesture controls add convenience but do not improve core audio performance. Overall, solid engineering with few novel advances. [1][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At **190 USD**, cost-performance is weak. A cheaper competitor, the **Soundcore C30i (69.99 USD)**, delivers **equivalent open-ear functionality** for many users: open-ear clip design, **Multipoint**, Bluetooth 5.3, 10 h single-charge / 30 h total, and IPX4 water resistance (one step below IPX5). **CP = 70 ÷ 190 = 0.37** → 0.4. In practice, you pay nearly 3× for Cleer’s nicer materials and extras without commensurate measured performance gains. [4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Cleer provides a **1-year limited warranty** on the Arc II Sport (parts and labor). [9] IPX5 should be adequate for sweaty workouts. The simple mechanical design should help durability; long-term failure-rate data is still scarce for this specific product. Firmware updates exist via the Cleer+ app; cadence and long-term support policy are unspecified. The UV-C hardware adds a potential failure point without durability upside.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Prioritizing awareness and comfort for workouts is sensible, and the hardware choices match that brief. Marketing emphasis on “high-quality audio” is tempered by unavoidable open-ear acoustic trade-offs. Pricing appears driven more by positioning and feature garnish than measurable audio improvements.

## Advice

Choose Arc II Sport if you explicitly need open-ear awareness for workouts and accept bass and isolation trade-offs. If you want similar utility for far less, **Soundcore C30i (69.99 USD)** is the value pick. A mid-priced alternative with strong ecosystem support is **Shokz OpenFit Air (119.95 USD)**. [4][5]
