## Overview

The OnePlus Buds Pro 2 is a premium wireless earbud released by OnePlus in 2023. It adopts a dual-driver configuration with an 11mm dynamic driver and 6mm planar magnetic driver, acoustically tuned by Danish Hi-Fi brand "Dynaudio." It boasts adaptive noise cancellation up to 48dB, LHDC 5.0 codec support, and up to 39 hours of continuous playback time. While exact pricing in the Japanese market can be confirmed on Amazon.co.jp and similar platforms, the global market price is approximately 177 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The OnePlus Buds Pro 2 demonstrates moderate scientific validity in measured performance. According to RTINGS measurements, the frequency response shows significant bass enhancement, with approximately +6dB boost in the low-frequency range even with balanced EQ settings, significantly deviating from the transparent level of ±1dB within the 20Hz-20kHz range. The midrange shows approximately 2-3dB recession, with minor attenuation also observed in the high frequencies. The noise cancellation performance is specified at up to 48dB, which exceeds the ideal 40dB+ standard. However, from the perspective of actual acoustic transparency, the measured bass enhancement causes midrange recession, compromising the clarity of instruments and vocals. While high-quality transmission is possible through Bluetooth 5.3 and LHDC 5.0 codec support, the acoustic tuning prioritizes subjective coloration over scientific fidelity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The technology demonstrates a high standard. The coaxial dual-driver configuration with 11mm dynamic and 6mm planar magnetic drivers represents a technical approach that surpasses conventional single-driver designs. The planar magnetic driver's high-frequency extension up to 40kHz covers regions difficult for conventional dynamic drivers. The maximum 48dB noise reduction through three noise cancellation chips and a four-microphone system represents technically excellent implementation. LHDC 5.0 codec support and 1Mbps high-bitrate transmission also utilize cutting-edge technology. However, these advanced technologies do not necessarily manifest as measurable advantages in final acoustic performance, suggesting room for improvement in technological deployment efficiency.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Cost-performance evaluation reveals challenges. While the OnePlus Buds Pro 2's global market price is 177 USD (approximately 26,000 JPY equivalent), the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC with equivalent or superior functionality and measured performance is available for approximately 70 USD (approximately 10,500 JPY). The Liberty 4 NC features similar adaptive ANC functionality, Hi-Res wireless support, and IPX4 water resistance, while RTINGS measurements show more neutral frequency characteristics. Calculation: 10,500 JPY ÷ 26,000 JPY = 0.40, resulting in a score of 0.4 when rounded. The OnePlus Buds Pro 2 is priced more than double that of equivalent-function products. Excluding Dynaudio's brand value, pure performance-to-price ratio lacks competitiveness.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

OnePlus's product support system is excellent. Firmware updates are provided regularly, with RTINGS conducting re-measurements using the latest firmware 186.186.101. IP55 dust and water resistance adequately handles daily use, while the 39-hour long battery life including case offers high practicality. OnePlus products generally have low failure rates with prompt support response within warranty periods. Bluetooth 5.3 connection stability is good, with stable multipoint connection operation. Long-term reliability maintains above-industry-average standards based on the company's past products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design approach is generally rational. The crossover design using dual-driver configuration is acoustically sound, and assigning high frequencies to the planar magnetic driver is a technically appropriate choice. The four-microphone placement and adaptive control of the ANC system also represent a modern approach. However, the final acoustic tuning involves Dynaudio's subjective coloration, prioritizing "auditory preference" over achieving measurement data transparency levels. This represents somewhat irrational aspects from a scientific fidelity pursuit perspective. Conversely, considering differentiation and practicality balance in the TWS market, it can be considered a commercially rational decision.

## Advice

The OnePlus Buds Pro 2 is an attractive choice for users who value technological advancement and brand prestige. It is particularly suitable for users who find value in the Dynaudio brand and prefer bass-enhanced sound signatures. However, for those prioritizing pure measured performance and cost-performance, alternative products like the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC should be considered. The 177 USD price point feels expensive compared to equivalent-function products. Users who prioritize scientific acoustic fidelity would be better served by products with more neutral frequency characteristics. The noise cancellation performance is excellent, providing sufficient practicality for commuting and business travel. We recommend checking EQ app adjustment capabilities before purchase.
