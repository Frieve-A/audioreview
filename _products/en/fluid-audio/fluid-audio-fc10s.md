## Overview

The FC10S is Fluid Audio’s 10-inch, 200 W Class-D studio subwoofer aimed at mid-to-large rooms. It offers balanced I/O (XLR/TRS), a continuously variable low-pass filter (50–200 Hz), 0–180° phase control, auto-standby, and a dedicated bypass footswitch for instant A/B checks. Manufacturer documentation lists a 20–200 Hz operating range and >100 dB(A) S/N. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent third-party anechoic or in-room measurements are not readily available. We therefore provisionally rely on manufacturer specifications: 10″ composite-paper driver, 200 W Class-D amp, 20–200 Hz range, >100 dB(A) S/N, and an input sensitivity spec indicating ~100 dB(A) at 1 m from 85 mV pink-noise input. These figures are plausible for a ported 10″ studio sub, but without external verification the confidence remains moderate. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design is conventional (ported enclosure, analog filters, no advanced DSP room correction). The included bypass footswitch is practical for workflow, yet not technically novel. Overall implementation meets industry norms without pushing boundaries. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Street price is 379 USD. We looked for the **cheapest equal-or-better** alternative defined from a user perspective as: (a) ~20 Hz low-frequency extension and (b) an included sub-bypass footswitch plus balanced I/O. PreSonus Temblor T10 meets those functions but is higher priced at 449.99 USD. JBL’s LSR310S is commonly cheaper than the T10, but it lacks a footswitch and its low-frequency extension is published to 27 Hz—therefore **not equal-or-better** on our criteria. Thus, no cheaper equivalent was found; CP = 1.0. [3][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Retailers list a 1-year limited warranty for Fluid Audio products. The feature set is simple and Class-D amplification tends to be reliable, but the brand’s small scale and limited published service metrics keep the score slightly above average rather than high. [6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Feature choices prioritize practical studio workflow (bypass footswitch, broad LPF range, phase trim) and measurable utility. There is no reliance on questionable claims; however, the product also does not introduce novel engineering that would materially advance the state of the art. [1][2]

## Advice

Integrate the FC10S by setting the LPF near your mains’ –6 dB point, then fine-tune phase for maximum null at the crossover region. Use the footswitch to sanity-check mixes with/without LF. As with any ported sub, placement and room modes dominate results—budget time for positioning and basic EQ if available in your monitor controller or DAW. If you need built-in room correction or extensive DSP, you’ll need to step up to a different class of product.
