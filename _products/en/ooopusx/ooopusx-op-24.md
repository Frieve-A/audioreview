## Overview

The ooopusX Op.24 represents the inaugural product from newcomer ooopusX, introducing a fresh approach to in-ear monitor design with its distinctive dual-mode tuning system. This hybrid IEM combines 2 dynamic drivers with 4 balanced armatures, featuring a silicone composite carbon fiber dome diaphragm and an innovative tuning dial that replaces traditional DIP switches. At 49.99 USD, the Op.24 positions itself in the competitive budget hybrid segment while offering unique technological implementations that distinguish it from established competitors.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ooopusX Op.24 faces significant challenges in scientific validity due to problematic THD specifications and limited measurement data availability. The manufacturer specifies THD as "<1%", which places this product in the problematic range according to measurement criteria (0.5% or above problematic for headphones/earphones). Critical performance metrics including S/N ratio, crosstalk, and passive isolation are not provided in available specifications. Third-party frequency response measurement data is not publicly available, preventing detailed deviation evaluation. The tuning system provides two distinct sound profiles, but comprehensive measurement data for both modes is not publicly available, requiring conservative assessment when detailed measurement data is limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Op.24 demonstrates genuinely innovative technology through its proprietary "Tunable Acoustics physical dual-mode tuning dial" with independent dual-channel electronic crossover, eliminating traditional DIP switch limitations. This product employs custom coaxial 10mm + 8mm dynamic drivers and features cavity topology optimized through simulation-oriented modeling and 3D printing experiments. The integration of physical tuning dial with electronic crossover enables users to intuitively switch between two distinct sound profiles without removing the IEMs from their ears. This implementation requires substantial development time and know-how, creating competitive advantage that other manufacturers would want to adopt. The advanced integration of hybrid drivers and ergonomic optimization demonstrates exceptional technical sophistication for a debut product from a new company.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The ooopusX Op.24 at 49.99 USD competes against products with equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance. The Op.24 provides detachable cable connectivity options and 2-mode tuning functionality, but its THD specification is <1%, placing it in the problematic range. Among products with equivalent-or-better connectivity and tuning features, and measured performance equivalent-or-better than the Op.24's <1% THD (at or below problematic level), the CCA Rhapsody at 49.99 USD is identified. The CCA Rhapsody provides comparable connectivity options through detachable cables, 4-stage tuning switches providing equivalent-or-better tuning functionality versus the Op.24's 2-mode system, and THD specification <0.5% providing equivalent-or-better measured performance compared to the Op.24's <1%. Both products share the same 49.99 USD market price, establishing the Op.24 as the cheapest option with its specific feature set. As no cheaper equivalent alternatives exist in the current market, the Op.24 achieves the maximum cost-performance score.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Op.24 benefits from retailer-based warranty coverage through ShenzhenAudio, which provides a two-year warranty for members along with comprehensive additional guarantees including 180-day quality exchange or refund, 7-day Dead on Arrival (DOA) protection, and 30-day return policy. However, as a product from a newly established brand, the company lacks a dedicated official website or direct manufacturer support channels, requiring reliance on dealer-based systems for service. The hybrid driver configuration with electronic crossover represents moderate complexity that may require specialized service, though retailer support infrastructure provides reasonable coverage for typical warranty needs. New brand status limits availability of historical reliability data for long-term assessment, but established retailer warranty terms provide adequate protection for typical product lifespan. Construction quality appears appropriate for the price category with lightweight design at 5.2g per side, though long-term durability of the mechanical tuning dial and electronic crossover systems will require market experience to evaluate fully.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Op.24 demonstrates rational aspects in functional improvements through the tuning dial system and measurement-focused development approach. The innovative tuning dial system directly addresses common user frustrations with traditional DIP switches, providing practical benefit through improved reliability and ease of use. The utilization of simulation-oriented modeling and 3D printing experiments for cavity topology optimization demonstrates measurement-focused development approach. However, the 2DD+4BA hybrid driver configuration and carbon fiber diaphragm adoption lack evidence of scientifically verified measurable performance improvements, representing technology choices with greater marketing significance across the industry. Per policy guidelines, "investing in quantities with no scientifically expected effects" and "manufacturer claims that appeal only to subjectivity without scientific verification are not highly evaluated." Furthermore, the THD specification achieving only <1% falls short of optimal performance levels available in competing products and does not contribute to achieving transparent levels in measurement results. Budget pricing focuses resources on functional value delivery rather than aesthetic premiums, but evaluation remains at average level due to scientifically unsubstantiated technology choices.

## Advice

The ooopusX Op.24 suits budget-conscious users seeking innovative tuning functionality in a hybrid IEM configuration. The unique dial-based tuning system offers practical advantages for users who frequently adjust sound profiles, while the carbon fiber driver technology provides contemporary materials implementation. The retailer-provided two-year warranty and comprehensive guarantee coverage through ShenzhenAudio provides reasonable protection for typical use scenarios. Users prioritizing measured performance specifications may prefer established alternatives like the CCA Rhapsody, which offers superior THD specifications (<0.5% vs <1%) and equivalent functionality at similar pricing. The Op.24 represents an interesting technological experiment with adequate warranty coverage, though users seeking optimal measured performance should consider alternatives with superior specifications.
