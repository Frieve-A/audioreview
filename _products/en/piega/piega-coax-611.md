## Overview

The Piega Coax 611 applies the brand’s ribbon expertise to a slim, aluminum floorstander. It combines the latest C112+ coaxial ribbon (GEN2) with two 160 mm UHQD woofers and three 160 mm passive radiators in an extruded aluminum cabinet reinforced by TIM2 bracing (117 × 21 × 31 cm; 45 kg) [1]. Piega hand-builds its speakers in Horgen, Switzerland. The GEN2 coax covers from ~450 Hz with an internal mid–tweeter crossover around 3.5 kHz [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third-party measurements show electrically benign behavior and solid linearity. LowBeats measured a sensitivity of 84.6 dB (2.83 V/1 m), continuous SPL of ~99 dB with short-term peaks to 111 dB, and an impedance/phase profile that remains above 4 Ω across the band with unusually linear curves [2]. Manufacturer specs list 32 Hz–50 kHz bandwidth, 4 Ω nominal impedance, and 90 dB sensitivity [1]. Taken together, the data indicate good on-axis balance and amplifier-friendly loading; however, publicly available third-party THD figures are limited, so the score reflects cautious weighting toward verified items [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The C112+ coaxial ribbon (planar magnetic mid-tweeter) reduces crossover complexity through the vocal range (~450 Hz upward) and targets phase-coherent radiation [2]. The aluminum enclosure with TIM2 tension bracing is a proprietary mechanical scheme to suppress panel resonance [1]. The driver topology (dual woofers + three passive radiators) and the coax implementation remain uncommon and difficult to duplicate, indicating high in-house know-how and durable differentiation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Using the **cheapest equivalent-or-better** passive floorstander we could identify: **KEF R11 Meta**. It provides comparable or better user-facing performance: documented CTA-2034 data with very flat response (ASR), low harmonic distortion claims (<0.5% from 80 Hz–20 kHz) and high maximum output (113 dB, manufacturer), with typical in-room bass extension to 26 Hz [3][4]. Current US market price observed at **6,500 USD per pair** (3,250 USD each) [4].  
**CP calculation (USD):** 6,500 USD ÷ 19,995 USD = **0.325** → **score 0.3** (rounded to one decimal).  
Selection note: KEF R11 Meta matches functions (passive stereo floorstander) and meets or exceeds key performance axes (FR linearity, distortion, and max SPL) based on the cited sources [3][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Piega offers a **6-year** warranty on loudspeakers (registration required), which is above industry average for passive speakers [5]. US distribution and service are handled by **MoFi Distribution** via the dedicated PIEGA USA channel, with dealer and support infrastructure listed publicly [6]. The passive design, robust aluminum cabinet, and absence of firmware reduce long-term failure modes relative to active/complex systems. Verified warranty policy and importer presence justify a higher-than-average score [5][6].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Design choices (coaxial ribbon for coherence, passive-radiator loading to avoid port turbulence, stiff aluminum cabinet with tension bracing) are technically motivated and aim at measurable improvements (directivity consistency, reduced enclosure resonance, amplifier-friendly impedance) [1][2]. Costs are clearly directed to structure and transducer tech rather than decorative mass. Absent broad third-party distortion datasets, claimed benefits largely align with established acoustics, warranting a positive but not maximal score.

## Advice

Seek this model if you value point-source-like directivity through the mid/tweeter region, a compact footprint, and premium build. Note that verified sensitivity (≈84.6 dB/2.83 V/1 m) is modest; choose amplification with adequate headroom into 4 Ω despite the speaker’s benign impedance behavior [2]. If your priority is maximum value at similar linearity and output, audition KEF R11 Meta as a substantially cheaper path with excellent measured behavior [3][4]. If you prefer Piega’s ribbon presentation and aluminum construction, the Coax 611 remains compelling.
