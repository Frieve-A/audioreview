## Overview

The Piega Coax811 is a flagship floor-standing speaker developed by Swiss high-end audio manufacturer Piega. It features a C212+ coaxial ribbon driver, two 8.7-inch woofers, and two passive radiators, achieving high rigidity through its unique aluminum cabinet structure. Founded in 1986, Piega has been a pioneer in ribbon tweeter technology, bringing numerous innovative products to market. The company's Coax series is renowned for its unique technology that realizes point source reproduction by placing the tweeter at the center of the midrange driver.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The speaker shows a significant discrepancy between the manufacturer's claimed sensitivity of 92dB/W/m and the actual measured value of 85.1dB(B)/2.83V/m, representing a nearly 7dB difference that has practical importance. The frequency response is relatively flat through the midrange but exhibits small dips in the high frequencies, with a slight rolloff in the uppermost octave. The impedance drops to a minimum of 3.6 ohms at 88Hz against the nominal 4-ohm rating, presenting a somewhat demanding load characteristic for amplifiers. As expected, a notch is confirmed near the passive radiator tuning frequency of 27Hz. When compared against the measurement criteria baseline table, some parameters approach problematic levels, and when evaluated alongside the latest digital equipment, the scientific validity remains only moderately above average.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The C212+ coaxial ribbon technology represents an advanced driver developed through thorough revision of the weaknesses found in previous Coax series models. The ribbon diaphragm, measuring just 0.02mm (equivalent to several hair strands), handles frequencies above 450Hz, while the tweeter and midrange essentially form a point source - a design that merits high technical evaluation. The aluminum cabinet incorporates the Tension Improve Module (TIM2), consisting of 10 internal vertical rails and 4 thick milled aluminum horizontal plates, creating an innovative structure that applies constant tension throughout the cabinet via manual tightening during production. These technologies possess uniqueness rarely seen in the industry and reach a level of patented technology that competitors cannot easily replicate. The manufacturing quality utilizing Swiss precision machining technology is also high-level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Against the 30,000 USD (approximately 4.5 million JPY) price setting, the KEF LS60 Wireless (5,999.99 USD) provides equivalent or superior functionality and measured performance. The KEF LS60 achieves 92.1dB(B) measured sensitivity, exceeding the Piega Coax811's 85.1dB(B), with frequency response of 26Hz-36kHz (±6dB), accurate acoustic characteristics through active DSP control, and even wireless functionality. The cost-performance calculation yields 5,999.99 USD ÷ 30,000 USD = 0.2, evaluating to 0.2. Similarly, the ELAC Uni-Fi 2.0 UF52 achieves sensitivity matching at 85dB while realizing even lower pricing at approximately 1,200 USD per pair, and the KEF R7 Meta provides excellent performance at approximately 5,000 USD per pair. Considering the reality that dedicated audio equipment's raison d'être can be substituted by more affordable products, this results in an extremely harsh cost-performance evaluation for speakers in this class.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

High manufacturing quality from Swiss production and a 6-year warranty exceeding industry standards are provided. Piega is an established brand with 39 years of history, having built an authorized dealer network in Japan as well, with purchase and support available through specialist retailers such as Audio Union and Sound Pit. The company's products generally have low failure rates and are designed to withstand long-term use. However, while having absolute advantages compared to emerging manufacturers, there are areas slightly inferior when compared to the industry's highest-standard manufacturers. As passive speakers requiring no firmware updates, long-term support concerns are minimized.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The point source realization through coaxial ribbon technology represents an acoustically rational approach, contributing to improved phase characteristics and sound image localization. The resonance suppression effects of the aluminum cabinet also have scientific basis. However, the design philosophy as passive speakers feels somewhat outdated in the modern era where frequency response optimization through active DSP control is possible. As demonstrated by products like the KEF LS60 Wireless and Genelec models, utilizing digital signal processing technology can achieve more accurate and consistent acoustic characteristics at lower cost. Additionally, the extremely high pricing strategy loses competitiveness against competing products offering equivalent acoustic performance at more rational prices, raising questions about the rationality of market strategy. While technical advancement is recognized, the overall design philosophy cannot be considered completely rational from the perspective of modern audio technology trends.

## Advice

While the Piega Coax811 certainly boasts high technical capability and manufacturing quality, careful consideration is necessary for practical purchasing decisions. The fact that KEF LS60 Wireless (5,999.99 USD) provides equivalent or superior measured performance plus the advantages of active DSP control against the 30,000 USD price cannot be ignored. Particularly significant is that KEF exceeds in measured sensitivity. If you find special value in Piega's distinctive tonality, Swiss manufacturing quality, or aluminum cabinet texture, it could be an option, but for those purely seeking sound quality and functionality, we recommend considering other alternatives. Should you contemplate purchase, please conduct thorough listening tests and carefully judge whether subjective satisfaction commensurate with the price difference can be obtained. Also consider that multiple products with superior measured performance exist at the same price range.
