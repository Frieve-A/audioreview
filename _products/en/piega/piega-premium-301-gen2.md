summary: "Swiss-made compact two-way with a magnetostatic ribbon tweeter and aluminum enclosure. The engineering is sensible, but independent Gen2 measurements are scarce; value is pressured by cheaper, well-measured rivals."

## Overview

The Premium 301 Gen2 combines PIEGA’s new **RM 01-24** magnetostatic ribbon tweeter with a 140 mm FSD-M mid-woofer in a compact aluminum-extrusion cabinet. The design targets lower cabinet resonance and improved treble linearity/distortion through a revised magnet topology for the ribbon[1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs list **39 Hz–50 kHz (±2 dB)** frequency range, **4 Ω** nominal impedance, and ~**88–89 dB** sensitivity (documents differ slightly)[1][2]. As comprehensive **third-party measurements for the Gen2** are not yet widely published, conclusions remain **provisional**. Speakers carry a **6-year warranty**[3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The symmetric magnet arrangement of the RM 01-24 ribbon is a rational approach to improving linearity and transient behavior; the rigid aluminum extrusion reduces enclosure resonances. These are competent, incremental advances rather than category-defining breakthroughs[1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Comparator (cheapest we can confidently judge equal-or-better):** **KEF LS50 Meta** — passive two-way standmount with excellent independent measurements; manufacturer FR **±3 dB 79 Hz–28 kHz** and very low THD at 90 dB[4][5].  
**Price basis:**  
- **Review target:** official MSRP **2,500 EUR/pair** (silver finish) → **2,725 USD** using the review-date official rate; used as the **denominator** for CP[2].  
- **Comparator:** **1,599.99 USD/pair** (US official site)[4].

**Calculation:** 1,599.99 USD ÷ 2,725 USD = **0.587** → **0.6** (rounded to one decimal).  
**Equivalence note:** both are passive two-way bookshelves; the LS50 Meta’s public spin-style data shows smoother on/off-axis response and low distortion that meet or exceed transparency targets, so it qualifies as equal-or-better while Gen2 data remain limited[4][5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

A clearly stated **6-year speaker warranty** (with authorized-dealer purchase and timely registration) and robust aluminum cabinetry support long-term durability[3].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing enclosure rigidity and driver linearity (ribbon magnet topology) is scientifically sound for fidelity. The direction is rational, but without independent data at launch, demonstrable advantages over cheaper, well-measured competitors remain unproven.

## Advice

If you prize compact aluminum construction and ribbon-tweeter traits from a Swiss build, the Premium 301 Gen2 is appealing. If **performance-per-dollar** is paramount, **KEF LS50 Meta** offers proven measurements at a far lower price.
