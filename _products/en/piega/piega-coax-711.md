## Overview

The Piega Coax711 is a floorstanding speaker from Swiss audio manufacturer Piega. It features coaxial ribbon drivers, standing 118cm tall and weighing 47kg. Specifications include 22Hz-50kHz frequency response, 92dB/W/m sensitivity, and 4-ohm impedance, with an aluminum cabinet. Evaluation focuses on measured performance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Achieves 22Hz-50kHz (±3dB) frequency response and 92dB sensitivity, meeting frequency response criteria. Coaxial design aids phase, but measured THD is low while detailed data is lacking. SNR and IMD not publicly available; third-party tests show verification challenges. Low-frequency handling via four 220mm woofers is adequate, but distortion details limit score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Coaxial ribbon module places tweeter and midrange on axis, using 0.007mm aluminum foil for lightweight design. Requires 8 hours of skilled labor per unit; 5mm aluminum cabinet and TIM system for resonance control are advanced. Woofers from SEAS, but overall originality is high industry level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At 25,000 USD, comparable to Revel F228Be (10,000 USD, 90dB sensitivity, 27Hz-44kHz, low THD, 3.4-ohm minimum). Calculation "10,000 USD ÷ 25,000 USD = 0.4" shows equivalent function and performance at 60% less cost, limiting cost-performance. Ribbon value doesn't offset price gap.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Established manufacturing history with 5-year warranty. Consistent quality from Swiss in-house production, low failure rates in reviews, but 20-employee scale limits service network compared to majors.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Coaxial ribbon approach has scientific basis for phase alignment and distortion reduction; cabinet resonance control is rational. However, equivalent measurements achievable cheaper via standard tech, questioning dedicated gear necessity. Optimization for cost-efficiency needed.

## Advice

The Piega Coax711 offers strong measured performance, but its 25,000 USD price requires caution given alternatives like Revel F228Be (10,000 USD), matching or exceeding in frequency and distortion. Prioritize performance-to-price; audition to verify value. Starting with affordable options is rational for ribbon interest.
