## Overview

The Piega Coax 411 is a bookshelf speaker from Swiss company Piega, founded in 1986. It features the company's signature ribbon tweeter technology with a 2-way configuration combining a 160mm UHQD woofer and C112+ coaxial ribbon. The speaker employs a robust 25kg aluminum cabinet with TIM2 cabinet internal bracing technology, claiming 35Hz-50kHz broadband reproduction. The company has focused on ribbon technology since its founding, achieving what they claim is an ideal point source through coaxial arrangement. Swiss precision manufacturing and proprietary driver design have established their position in the high-end audio market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

While the nominal frequency response claims 35Hz-50kHz, actual measurements show reproduction from 37Hz (-6dB), which is average by modern standards for low-frequency extension. Measured sensitivity shows significant deviation from catalog specifications, with actual measurements at 83.9dB/1kHz versus the claimed 90dB/W/m - a 6dB difference. Impedance characteristics show a minimum value of 3.7Ω/120Hz, with EPDR minimum of 2.17Ω/11kHz, creating heavy amplifier loading. Detailed THD and IMD data are not publicly available, lacking the measurement data necessary for scientific audio quality evaluation. While coaxial ribbon arrangement for point source creation has theoretical advantages, actual measurement results show no clear superiority compared to similarly-priced competitive products. Performance remains at standard levels for the speaker category.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Piega's proprietary coaxial ribbon configuration presents technical interest. The C112+ ribbon tweeter covers 450Hz-50kHz, employing a different approach from conventional dome types. The ribbon diaphragm also serves as the voice coil, reducing moving mass to 7 milligrams. TIM2 cabinet technology applying tension to internal walls contributes to resonance suppression. The design combining with the 160mm UHQD woofer demonstrates certain technical completeness. However, the impact of these technologies on final measurement performance is limited, and cannot be considered innovative compared to products achieving similar performance from other manufacturers. The 8-hour manual assembly process has craftsmanship value but does not constitute evidence of technical superiority.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Against the 9,995USD (approximately 1.5 million JPY) price, the equivalent function and performance Monitor Audio Bronze 100 is available for 675USD (approximately 100,000 JPY). The Bronze 100 offers 37Hz-30kHz (-6dB) frequency characteristics with 8-inch driver low-frequency capability, providing practically equivalent performance to the Coax 411's 35Hz-50kHz specification. Calculation: 675USD ÷ 9,995USD = 0.0675, rounding to 0.1. The KEF LS50 Meta (1,499USD) also offers 47Hz-45kHz characteristics with more rational pricing. The Wharfedale Diamond 12.1 (approximately 300USD) shows excellent performance in the same bookshelf category. The Piega Coax 411 costs approximately 15 times more than equivalent function and performance products, resulting in extremely low evaluation in pure performance-to-price ratio. Swiss manufacturing and ribbon technology elements do not directly contribute to function and performance, therefore are not considered in cost-performance evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Piega has 38 years of history since its 1986 founding and is based in Switzerland as a small manufacturer (20 employees). Domestic support structure in various markets is limited, with concerns about repair and maintenance response. Product warranty period is at industry standard levels, but despite the high price, no specially extended warranty is provided. As a small manufacturer, there are uncertainties about future parts supply and technical support continuity. Ribbon drivers have special construction, creating challenges in repair costs and parts availability during failures. Firmware updates are not applicable to this product category. Overall, support structure is judged below standard for a high-priced product.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The point source approach through coaxial ribbon technology is theoretically rational, but its contribution to actual measurement performance improvement is limited. Ribbon technology itself has existed since the 1970s and cannot be considered particularly advanced in modern times. The 25kg cabinet design and material investment have visual impact but may represent redundant design exceeding the scientifically necessary range for audio quality improvement. In the modern era where equivalent measurement performance can be achieved with conventional technology, the necessity of ribbon technology has decreased. From the pricing perspective, the direction strongly emphasizes brand value and rarity over practical performance, judged as low investment efficiency for rational audio quality improvement. Limited disclosure of measurement data is also passive from modern standards emphasizing scientific approaches.

## Advice

For those considering the Piega Coax 411 purchase, we recommend examining alternatives that achieve equivalent practical performance at more rational prices. The Monitor Audio Bronze 100 can achieve substantially the same acoustic performance with 37Hz-30kHz characteristics for 100,000 JPY. The KEF LS50 Meta offers more sophisticated technology at around 150,000 JPY. With a 1.5 million JPY budget, higher audio quality could be achieved through combinations of high-performance DAC, amplifier, and speakers. Even for those committed to Swiss manufacturing or ribbon technology, the actual contribution to audio quality should be coolly evaluated. Limited measurement data is also concerning. Considering the original purpose of audio investment - audio quality improvement - product selection based on more scientific evidence is recommended. A modern perspective prioritizing actual measurement performance over brand or rarity is important.
