## Overview

The AMATERAS 9000 is a send-in modification of Sony's MDR-CD900ST offered by Tokyo-based AMATERAS. Customers ship in a working CD900ST; the shop converts it and returns it in roughly a week. The 9000 is positioned as a "pure reference" evolution of the CD900ST, promising enhanced spatial clarity while preserving the base monitor's character. Pricing and purchase details are handled directly via the company's online shop, where standard sales and subscription options are listed along with returns and warranty terms. 

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are no independent, published third-party measurements (frequency response curves, THD vs. SPL, group delay, isolation) demonstrating objective improvements over the stock MDR-CD900ST. Official CD900ST specs are known—106 dB/mW sensitivity, 63 Ω impedance, and 5–30,000 Hz frequency range—but these are catalog figures and do not evidence any measurable change brought by the 9000 modification. In the absence of verifiable lab data showing audibly meaningful deltas (e.g., lower THD at 94/104 dB, tighter FR deviation across 20 Hz–20 kHz), the enhancement claims remain unvalidated, so the baseline score is applied.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

AMATERAS 9000 is an expert modification built on the long-standing CD900ST platform rather than a ground-up transducer design. While workmanship can be high and parts quality may be emphasized, there is no disclosure of novel driver technology, new acoustic architectures, or published engineering analyses. It represents skilled craft on proven hardware rather than a step-change in headphone tech.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Cheapest equal-or-better comparator: **AKG K361**. It provides equivalent user-facing function (closed-back studio monitor headphone) and meets or exceeds key measured performance indicators documented by an independent lab: very low harmonic distortion (approx. **0.05% at 94 dB** and strong results across the sweep) and compliant frequency-response accuracy within their target methodology. Current market price observed at a major US retailer is **135 USD**.  
**Calculation:** 135 USD ÷ 243 USD = **0.6**.  
Given no credible published measurements showing the 9000 objectively surpasses the K361 on FR/THD/isolation, the K361 sets a conservative baseline for equal-or-better performance at lower cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AMATERAS provides a **one-year warranty** on AMATERAS products and lists a **three-week free-return window**. The base CD900ST platform is proven in pro use, and the shop's process and turnaround are described clearly. However, support is concentrated around a small direct-to-customer operation, which can pose availability risks outside Japan.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 9000's stated goal emphasizes subjective listening qualities (spatial feel, ease of listening) rather than documented advances in transparent monitoring accuracy. Without verifiable data indicating quantifiable improvements (e.g., lower distortion, tighter FR deviation, higher isolation), the approach leans toward voicing preference more than objective monitoring rationality.

## Advice

If you love the CD900ST's ergonomics and want a warranty-backed, CD900ST-based experience, the AMATERAS 9000 is a niche option. For users needing **documented** neutral-ish monitors with strong lab data, consider **AKG K361** (lower cost, measured low THD) or **AKG K371** (similarly well-measured with slightly different tuning) before paying a premium for an unmeasured mod. Professionals who depend on calibrated, repeatable results should prioritize models with published measurement suites.
