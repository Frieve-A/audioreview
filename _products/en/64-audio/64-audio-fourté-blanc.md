## Overview

The 64 Audio Fourté Blanc represents the final limited edition iteration of the acclaimed Fourté series, with only 500 units produced worldwide. Released in November 2022 at 3,699 USD, it features a 4-driver hybrid configuration combining one dynamic driver with three balanced armature drivers, implementing 64 Audio's proprietary tubeless in-ear audio (tia) technology and Apex air pressure exchange system. The product is positioned as "the first fully tubeless universal in-ear monitor" with exclusive white ceramic coating and upgraded internal components including Cardas copper wiring and Mundorf SilverGold solder. This limited production model concludes the Fourté lineage with emphasis on boutique craftsmanship and premium materials [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comprehensive third-party measurements are unavailable [2]. Manufacturer specifications provide frequency response of 5Hz-20kHz and -20dB isolation, but THD, S/N ratio, SINAD, IMD, and crosstalk remain unspecified [1]. Without independent measurement data, Scientific Validity cannot be properly evaluated. The conservative 0.5 score reflects this data absence.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Fourté Blanc demonstrates solid proprietary technology through multiple patented innovations. The tubeless in-ear audio (tia) system, awarded U.S. Patent #US10721549B2 in 2020, allows drivers to radiate freely into a single bore without obstructions [4]. The Apex air pressure exchange technology, patented in 2019 as U.S. Patent #10,441,470, provides pneumatically interactive venting for pressure relief. Linear Impedance Design (LID) corrects non-linear electrical resistance across multiple driver sets. The company maintains complete in-house design and manufacturing control with skilled technician assembly in the United States [1]. However, these core technologies are now 6-10 years mature, not representing cutting-edge innovation. The 4-driver hybrid configuration with passive crossover is competent but not particularly advanced. Significant cost allocation goes to premium materials like Cardas copper wiring and Mundorf solder that provide marketing value rather than measurable performance advantages. Technology desirability among competitors remains moderate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

At 3,699 USD, the Fourté Blanc provides manufacturer-specified -20dB passive isolation and 5Hz-20kHz frequency response [1]. No third-party measurements exist for distortion, frequency response accuracy, or isolation performance.

The Shure SE846 Gen 2 (999 USD) provides manufacturer-specified 37dB passive isolation (exceeding Fourté Blanc's -20dB) and 15Hz-20kHz frequency response [2]. Regarding frequency response range: Fourté Blanc claims 5Hz-20kHz while SE846 specifies 15Hz-20kHz. However, frequencies below 20Hz are outside human audible range, making this difference irrelevant for user-perceivable performance. Both products provide equivalent user-facing functionality: universal IEM, detachable cable, passive isolation. SE846's superior documented isolation (37dB vs -20dB) confirms equivalent-or-better performance.

CP = 999 USD ÷ 3,699 USD = 0.27

Rounded to first decimal place: 0.3.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

64 Audio provides comprehensive manufacturer support with a standard 2-year warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship, plus 30-day fit guarantee extending to 45 days internationally [1]. The centralized repair system offers tiered service pricing with Tier 5 repairs for tia Fourté series at 299 USD, featuring approximately 3-week turnaround times. Global support availability through official website and authorized dealers ensures accessibility. The product construction emphasizes durability with recessed connector design specifically implemented to reduce connection wear and extend lifespan. No documented widespread reliability issues or manufacturing defects have been identified. The robust T6061 aluminum shell construction with ceramic coating provides inherent resistance to physical degradation. Customer shipping responsibility for warranty service represents standard industry practice. Regular parts availability including cable replacements supports long-term ownership. Professional reviews consistently praise 64 Audio build quality and ergonomic design across the product line.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The Fourté Blanc demonstrates fundamentally irrational design philosophy despite possessing legitimate proprietary technologies. Founder Vitaliy Belonozhko explicitly prioritizes "inspiration and honest sound delivery" over measurement data, drawing from "jewelry and boutique craftsmanship" rather than scientific optimization [3]. This anti-scientific approach contradicts evidence-based audio engineering principles. The 3,699 USD price structure allocates majority costs to non-functional elements: white ceramic coating, hand-pressed packaging imperfections, Cardas copper wiring, and Mundorf SilverGold solder provide aesthetic and marketing value without documented performance improvements. Claims of "lower distortion by half" lack supporting measurement evidence, representing unverified marketing assertions [3]. The design philosophy emphasizes subjective "balance and uniqueness" over measurable performance optimization. While the company has developed valuable patented technologies (tia, Apex, LID), the overall approach prioritizes premium materials and boutique manufacturing over cost-effective performance maximization. The 32,999 USD Founders Edition pricing for 10 units exemplifies irrationality through extreme cost allocation to exclusivity rather than functional improvement [1]. This philosophy directly opposes scientific approaches that would redirect premium component costs toward measurable acoustic improvements.

## Advice

The 64 Audio Fourté Blanc serves a specific market segment prioritizing proprietary acoustic technologies and limited edition exclusivity over cost optimization. Potential purchasers should recognize the significant price premium allocated to non-functional premium materials, boutique manufacturing, and collectible status rather than pure performance value. The absence of third-party measurements prevents quantitative performance verification, requiring trust in manufacturer specifications and subjective evaluations. The proprietary tia and Apex technologies provide genuine functional differentiation not available at lower price points, potentially justifying consideration for users specifically seeking these acoustic approaches. However, budget-conscious buyers seeking maximum measured performance per dollar should examine alternatives with comprehensive third-party testing data. The limited 500-unit production creates artificial scarcity affecting future availability and potential resale considerations. Users prioritizing measurement-verified performance characteristics should await independent testing or consider products with established third-party measurement databases.
