## Overview

The Cypher Labs Theorem 720 is a discontinued portable DAC and headphone amplifier that was originally priced at 799 USD. Featuring an AKM4396 24-bit/192kHz DAC chip in a fully balanced circuit configuration, the device was designed to provide high-resolution audio for Apple devices, Mac/PC, and select Android devices. The unit offers both balanced 4-pin and single-ended 3.5mm headphone outputs, along with a dedicated line output at 2.1 Vrms. With three adjustable gain levels and up to 18 hours of battery life, the Theorem 720 was positioned as a premium portable audio solution before being discontinued by the now-defunct manufacturer.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Third-party measurements from Audio Science Review reveal significant performance deficiencies. The device shows SINAD values of -83 dB at minimum volume and -67 dB at maximum volume [1], both falling well below the 80 dB transparent threshold for headphone amplifiers. Particularly concerning is the sharp degradation to -67 dB when volume is increased to maximum, indicating massive increases in harmonic distortion. Even the cheaper FiiO Q1 at 69 USD outperforms the Theorem 720 by 3 dB with -86 dB SINAD [1]. User reports confirm "extremely audible constant hiss" and "extremely high noise floor" that becomes "incredibly distracting during quiet passages" [2]. The output impedance specification of below 1 ohm meets transparent level requirements, but this single positive attribute cannot compensate for the fundamental distortion and noise issues that place this product firmly in the problematic performance category.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Theorem 720 employs standard 2014-era technology with the AKM4396 DAC chip in a conventional balanced circuit implementation. While the fully balanced design from DAC to headphone output represents competent engineering, the technology lacks innovation or proprietary advancement. The device offers standard features including three gain settings, Apple device compatibility with automatic detection, and battery operation. However, by current 2025 standards, the AKM4396 represents outdated technology, and the analog-only approach without digital signal processing integration demonstrates limited technological sophistication. The absence of proprietary patents, advanced digital integration, or cutting-edge features places this product below average in technology level evaluation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

At the original price of 799 USD, cost-performance evaluation identifies the Questyle M15C at 110 USD as the comparison target. Equipped with both 4.4mm balanced and 3.5mm single-ended outputs, 24-bit high-resolution support up to PCM 384kHz/DSD256, and measured performance including THD of 0.00028% that significantly exceeds the Theorem 720's problematic -67 dB SINAD performance [3]. The cost-performance calculation: 110 USD รท 799 USD = 0.1. The availability of superior measured performance at approximately one-seventh the price demonstrates significant cost-performance weakness in the premium pricing tier.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The Theorem 720 suffers from significant reliability concerns and complete absence of manufacturer support. User reports document fundamental design issues including "extremely audible constant hiss" that occurs immediately upon device activation [2]. When contacted about this noise floor problem, the manufacturer suggested return for refund rather than repair, indicating a design characteristic rather than fixable defect. The device is covered by only a one-year warranty period, below industry average. With Cypher Labs now defunct and all products discontinued, no warranty service, parts availability, or technical support exists. While the simple portable construction may offer some inherent durability advantages, the combination of documented quality control issues and complete support absence creates substantial long-term reliability concerns.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The design philosophy emphasizes "audiophile grade" performance and portable balanced circuitry but lacks scientific validation through measurement-based development. Claims of superior audio quality are contradicted by objective measurements showing problematic SINAD values and noise floor issues. The high price point relative to measured performance indicates poor cost-effectiveness, with engineering priorities seemingly focused on marketing positioning rather than measurable audio improvement. The absence of scientific measurement validation in the development process, combined with the manufacturer's discontinuation of the product line without successor models, suggests stagnation in performance progression. While the balanced implementation represents rational design direction, the overall approach prioritizes subjective claims over objective performance validation.

## Advice

The Cypher Labs Theorem 720 cannot be recommended due to discontinued status and fundamental performance deficiencies. Current users experiencing noise floor issues should consider replacement with modern alternatives offering superior measured performance and active manufacturer support. For users seeking portable DAC/amplifier functionality with balanced outputs, options like the Questyle M15C provide equivalent features at significantly lower cost with superior measured performance characteristics. Those prioritizing maximum cost-effectiveness should consider the FiiO KA11 at 30 USD, which delivers superior measured performance despite lacking balanced output. The combination of problematic audio performance, absent manufacturer support, and availability of superior alternatives makes this product unsuitable for current purchasing consideration.
