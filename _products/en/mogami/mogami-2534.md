## Overview

The Mogami 2534 (W2534) is a professional Neglex **star-quad** microphone cable aimed at installations where magnetic hum and RF ingress are problematic. It uses four 24-AWG OFC conductors (paired to form a double-balanced line), XLPE insulation, and a spiral “served” copper shield. Official electrical data include 97 pF/m conductor-to-conductor and 110 pF/m conductor-to-shield capacitance in the balanced quad connection, with low series resistance suitable for long runs [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Star-quad geometry is a proven method to **reduce magnetically induced hum** well beyond ordinary 2-conductor balanced cable. Authoritative references report **≈20–30 dB** improvement relative to standard mic cable when properly wired and used near interference sources [5][6]. Mogami’s published capacitance (≈97–110 pF/m depending on reference point) is modest; with a typical 150 Ω microphone source and 18 m (≈60 ft) run, the theoretical HF loss at 20 kHz is **<0.01 dB**—negligible for audibility [1][2]. In clean electromagnetic environments, audible differences versus any competent balanced cable are therefore minimal; the benefits manifest primarily where interference exists.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design implements mature, industry-standard **star-quad** practice dating back decades. Materials and construction (XLPE insulation; spiral served shield) are solid, but not novel. Mogami promotes a spiral shield for ease of termination and flexibility, whereas many competitors (e.g., Canare, Belden) use tight braids with high coverage; each approach has trade-offs rather than clear technical supremacy [1][3]. Overall sophistication is competent and professional, but not innovative.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Current market price:** **1.59 USD/ft** for W2534 bulk cable [2].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **Canare L-4E6S** star-quad mic cable at **0.59 USD/ft** (24-AWG, star-quad, 144 pF/m cond-cond; widely used in professional wiring) [3][4]. Functionally, both provide star-quad magnetic hum rejection and professional electrical performance; measured capacitance differs but remains transparent for typical mic runs [1][3].

0.59 USD ÷ 1.59 USD = **0.37**

Rounded to one decimal place → **0.4**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Mogami has a long record in pro cabling and consistent manufacturing. Bulk cable warranty/support is generally handled via distributors; there is no public field failure-rate data. The served shield is flexible and easy to terminate; braided shields on alternatives may offer higher coverage but are stiffer—practical durability depends on use and handling rather than brand claims [1][3]. Overall, reliability meets typical pro expectations without standing out.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Prioritizing **EMI/RFI rejection by geometry** (star-quad) is a rational, measurement-aligned way to improve real-world noise performance where needed. However, the approach is conventional and readily available from multiple brands at lower prices. Positioning as a premium option is not matched by unique, measurable advantages across typical use cases.

## Advice

Choose Mogami 2534 if you have **verified hum/RF issues** (e.g., proximity to power transformers, dimmers, or transmitters) and value the handling of a spiral-shield cable. For most studio and stage runs with sensible routing and grounding, cheaper star-quad like **Canare L-4E6S** will deliver equivalent audible results at much lower cost [3][6]. Prioritize proper system grounding and cable dressing; add star-quad where interference is confirmed.
