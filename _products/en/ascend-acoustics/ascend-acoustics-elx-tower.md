## Overview

The Ascend Acoustics ELX TOWER is the company's flagship floor-standing speaker released in 2022 after over 10 years of development. Utilizing industry-leading Klippel NFS (Near Field Scanner) for design optimization, it is positioned as a "true endgame speaker" aimed at competing with speakers across all price ranges. The speaker features a 3-way, 4-driver configuration with a unique 3-layer bamboo cabinet, custom Titan dome tweeter, and dedicated sealed midrange enclosure.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The ELX TOWER achieves excellent scientific validity through industry-leading measurement technology. The Klippel NFS optimization design allows it to achieve a nominal frequency response of 32Hz – 28kHz (±3dB), and measurements confirm excellent low-frequency extension down to the low 30Hz range. This performance is close to the transparent level in measurement standards. The 6-inch EX Curv cone midrange driver housed in a dedicated sealed enclosure significantly reduces intermodulation distortion, while the SEAS Norway-made custom Titan dome tweeter achieves high-frequency extension up to 28kHz with low distortion and excellent directivity. The publication of CTA-2034 standard data and provision of individual measurement data with serial numbers ensures the reliability of its measured performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The ELX TOWER incorporates industry-leading technology. The world-first complete design optimization using Klippel NFS demonstrates advancement far beyond conventional measurement techniques. The 3-layer vertically laminated bamboo cabinet achieves dramatic resonance suppression compared to MDF, while ensuring safety through formaldehyde-free construction. The custom Titan tweeter co-developed with SEAS and the 3-way crossover technology requiring over 10 years of development represent highly valuable proprietary technical achievements. The dual 6-inch LX woofers' low-frequency extension capability down to the low 30Hz range also demonstrates excellent technical level considering physical constraints.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The ELX TOWER is priced at 2,649 USD per pair (1,324.50 USD per unit). This speaker achieves top-tier measured performance, including a flat frequency response optimized using Klippel NFS, low distortion, and excellent directivity control. When compared to competing products with equivalent or superior measured performance, such as the KEF R5 Meta (approx. 4,000 USD/pair) or the Revel Performa3 F206 (approx. 4,000 USD/pair), the ELX TOWER's price is significantly lower. As there are no readily available alternatives that offer comparable performance at a lower price, this product is effectively the most affordable option in its performance class. Therefore, its cost-performance is evaluated at 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The ELX TOWER provides an industry-leading reliability and support system. The 7-year manufacturer warranty significantly exceeds the industry average, and an additional 30-day satisfaction guarantee is also offered. Quality control is thorough through hand assembly, inspection, and packaging in Orange County, California, with each product including individual frequency response measurement data with serial numbers. The US-based manufacturing and support system ensures after-sales service reliability. It can be evaluated as a product with an established support foundation, unlike emerging manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The ELX TOWER's design philosophy is extremely rational. The scientific measurement approach using Klippel NFS is ideal as an objective design methodology that eliminates subjective sound quality evaluation. The adoption of a bamboo cabinet is a rational material choice aimed at the measurable effect of resonance suppression, with environmental consideration as an additional benefit. The reduction of intermodulation distortion through a dedicated sealed midrange enclosure and the publication of CTA-2034 standard data are all design decisions based on scientific evidence. The dedication of over 10 years of development to achieve a transparent level of performance is highly commendable as an exemplary model of a scientific approach in the audio industry.

## Advice

The ELX TOWER is a rare product that achieves industry-leading levels of technology and scientific validity while also offering phenomenal cost-performance. The price of 2,649 USD per pair is exceptional considering its outstanding measured performance. Achieving comparable performance from other brands would require a significantly larger investment. For readers who prioritize objective performance and seek audio fidelity that exceeds the price tag, it would be difficult to find a more rational choice. Combined with a 7-year warranty and the reliability of US-based manufacturing, this is a highly recommended product truly worthy of its "endgame speaker" title.
