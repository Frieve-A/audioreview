## Overview

The Beyerdynamic DT 990 PRO is a long-established open-back studio headphone handcrafted in Germany. Available in 80Ω and 250Ω, it targets mixing and mastering with a single-sided coiled cable and serviceable parts on the 250Ω model.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The overall balance is bright with modest bass roll-off and some mid-treble lift. RTINGS (Test Bench 2.0) reports **Bass Amount −1 dB**, **Treble Amount 0 dB**, **PRTF Accuracy (RMS) 2.35 dB**, **WHD 0.06% @94 dB SPL / 0.19% @104 dB SPL**, and **Sensitivity 103.6 dB SPL @1 kHz-1 V** [1]. Reference Audio Analyzer reports **Sensitivity 99.9 dB SPL** and **measured impedance 268.7 Ω** for the 250-ohm version [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A classic dynamic, open-back construction that prioritizes robustness and serviceability. There is no integrated DSP or the newer “Stellar.45” driver platform; the 250Ω cable is fixed. Mature and proven rather than cutting-edge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Street price used: **180 USD**. The cheapest **non-inferior** open-back monitor alternative is **Sennheiser HD 560S at 149 USD**, which scores **Audio Reproduction Accuracy 8.1** versus **7.9** for the DT 990 PRO on RTINGS v2.0 [1][5][6].  
**CP = 149 / 180 = 0.83.**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Beyerdynamic offers a **2-year warranty** and maintains parts/repair channels. German manufacturing, replaceable pads, and long product continuity support long-term use [3][4].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Goal & constraints:** prioritize durability, comfort, and a bright, spacious monitor presentation.  
**Trade-offs:** fixed cable and lack of DSP/modern driver platform in exchange for serviceable construction.  
**Evidence alignment:** marketed for mixing/mastering; the bright tilt aids detail checks but deviates from neutral-target monitoring, so alignment is partial.  
**Longevity:** long production run and parts support are strong.  
Net assessment: clear goals with consistent build choices, but partial mismatch with neutrality-focused reference use keeps the score moderate.

## Advice

A strong choice if you want a durable, serviceable open-back with a lively, airy presentation for editing and detail checks. For a more neutral reference at lower cost, **Sennheiser HD 560S** is a compelling alternative.
