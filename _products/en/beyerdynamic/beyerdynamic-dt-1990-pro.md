## Overview

The beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO MKII is the latest open-back studio headphone announced in 2025 by beyerdynamic, a venerable German audio manufacturer. Featuring newly developed TESLA.45 driver technology and changing from the previous generation's 250Ω to a 30Ω low-impedance design, it significantly improves compatibility with a wide range of audio equipment. It achieves 5Hz-40kHz wide-band reproduction capability and smoother high-frequency reproduction that addresses the harsh high-frequency characteristics criticized in the previous generation. Continuing hand assembly in Germany, it features a design optimized for professional mixing and mastering applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

According to objective measurement data, the DT 1990 PRO MKII shows significantly improved technical performance from the previous generation. The newly developed TESLA.45 driver maintains total harmonic distortion (THD) below 0.01%, clearing transparent-level standards. Imaging performance shows excellent weighted group delay of 0.1 with extremely good L/R phase matching. Most importantly, the 8kHz treble peak that was problematic in the previous generation has been significantly suppressed, achieving the manufacturer's claimed "smoother high-frequency reproduction." This improvement resolves sibilance harshness issues and represents major progress toward transparent acoustic reproduction. The low to mid frequencies remain flat and excellent, and with high-frequency improvements, overall scientific validity has increased.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

beyerdynamic's newly developed TESLA.45 driver technology achieves high efficiency and low distortion through magnetic circuit design that significantly evolved from conventional Tesla drivers. The 30Ω low-impedance design represents a technical challenge, successfully maintaining high sound quality while ensuring compatibility with a wide range of equipment. The resolution of high-frequency characteristic issues that were technical challenges in the previous generation at the design stage, achieving "extremely low distortion and excellent impulse characteristics," is commendable. Hand assembly in Germany continues, providing excellent quality control. Through 45mm driver optimization and new magnetic circuit design, it achieves technology levels above industry average, but falls short of revolutionary breakthroughs, representing refined development of conventional technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The current price in the Japanese market is 675 USD, but cost-performance is significantly inferior when compared to competitive products with equivalent function and performance. The Audio-Technica ATH-R70x at 254 USD (Kakaku.com lowest price) provides equivalent functionality as an open-back studio headphone and has actually received excellent sound quality evaluations from many professionals. The ATH-R70x features lightweight design (210g) making it more suitable for extended use and has received excellent evaluations for soundstage width. Calculation: 254 USD ÷ 675 USD = 0.38, rounded to 0.4. Even considering the technical improvements in the MKII, this price difference (approximately 2.7 times) is difficult to justify from a pure performance-to-price ratio perspective.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

beyerdynamic is a venerable German audio manufacturer founded in 1924 and has established high reliability in the industry. Products come with 2-year international warranty, and comprehensive support systems are established through authorized dealers in Japan. Manufacturing in Germany ensures quality consistency and long-term product supply expectations. The company's products generally have low failure rates and possess durability for long-term use. User-replaceable design allows easy maintenance through ear pad and cable replacement. However, compared to emerging manufacturers, there are conservative aspects in pricing, preventing it from reaching the highest standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The DT 1990 PRO MKII demonstrates extremely rational design philosophy that solves previous generation issues through scientific approaches. Open-back design for studio monitoring applications is acoustically rational, and the 30Ω low-impedance design achieves compatibility with a wide range of equipment. Most importantly, the technical resolution of the 8kHz treble peak that was problematic in the previous generation achieves the transparency and neutrality that monitor headphones should strive for. The manufacturer's explanation of "smoother high-frequency reproduction" reflects actual improvements based on scientific measurement data, enabling accurate monitoring. The optimization for different applications through two types of ear pads - "Producing Velours" and "Mixing & Mastering Velours" - is also a rational approach. Through problem-solving utilizing measurement technology, the current generation achieves extremely advanced and rational design philosophy.

## Advice

Those considering purchase of the DT 1990 PRO MKII should carefully compare prices with competitive products offering equivalent functionality. The Audio-Technica ATH-R70x at 254 USD (Kakaku.com lowest price) provides equivalent functionality as an open-back studio headphone. The ATH-R70x is lightweight (210g) suitable for long-term use and has evaluations of excellent soundstage. While the DT 1990 PRO MKII resolves the 8kHz treble peak issues of the previous generation and achieves transparent, accurate studio monitoring, it requires approximately 2.7 times the price premium. Purchase can be justified when finding value in the 30Ω low-impedance design's wide equipment compatibility, German manufacturing quality, and application-specific optimization through two types of ear pads. For budget-conscious buyers, the ATH-R70x is the rational choice, but the MKII is worth consideration when prioritizing technical completeness and long-term quality.
