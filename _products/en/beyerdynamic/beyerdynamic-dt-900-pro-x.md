## Overview

The beyerdynamic DT 900 PRO X are open-back studio headphones for critical listening, mixing, and mastering. They use the new 48-ohm STELLAR.45 driver system in a serviceable, modular build that is handmade in Germany, with most parts replaceable (pads, headband, cables, and more) [3]. Technical data include 5–40,000 Hz manufacturer FR spec, 48 Ω impedance, ~345 g weight, and detachable 1.8 m / 3 m straight cables via a 3-pin mini-XLR cup connector [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent measurements agree on a largely neutral low–midrange with very good bass extension for an open-back, but they also show a prominent energy rise in the mid/upper treble (roughly 6–12 kHz). DIY-Audio-Heaven reports “20 Hz = 0 dB” extension with slightly elevated 50–500 Hz and clear treble features [2], while RTINGS’ raw/derived data show limited low-bass level (LFE ~58 Hz) and notable treble structure, yet good imaging and channel matching metrics [1]. Distortion is low: DIY-Audio-Heaven’s plots indicate mostly 2nd-harmonic content in the deep bass and <1% above ~70 Hz at ~94 dB SPL; higher bands stay very low [2]. Overall, transparency is strong but the elevated upper band can be bright to some users.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

STELLAR.45 combines a neodymium ring magnet, copper-clad lightweight voice-coil wire, and a three-layer diaphragm with integrated damping to keep the coil controlled in the gap even at high excursion, aiming for efficiency and low distortion from common interfaces and mobile sources [3]. Compared with legacy high-impedance DT models, the 48 Ω load and detachable mini-XLR ecosystem improve practical drivability and serviceability without sacrificing measured performance.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Current market price of the review target: **269.99 USD** (new) [5].  
Cheapest equivalent-or-better competitor identified: **Sennheiser HD 560S at 233.99 USD** (new) [6]. The HD 560S is an open-back, wired monitor headphone with at least as neutral a midband, low distortion, and high sensitivity (120 Ω / ~110 dB/V), meeting functional and measured-performance equivalence for monitoring [7][1].

**Calculation:** 233.99 USD ÷ 269.99 USD = **0.8667 → 0.9**.  
DT 900 PRO X retains an advantage in modular parts and robust construction, but purely on price/performance the HD 560S is cheaper while meeting the equivalence threshold.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Handmade in Germany with robust materials; nearly all components are replaceable (pads, cables, headband, etc.) [3]. Warranty is **up to 2 years** (standard manufacturer terms; cables/accessories may be shorter) [4]. The detachable mini-XLR system and official spares ecosystem support long service life. This combination merits a high score even without an extended (3-year) term.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

A low-impedance, efficient driver tuned for studio SPL from ordinary interfaces is a rational direction. The modular construction aligns with longevity and total-cost-of-ownership goals. However, the persistent upper-treble rise (seen across credible measurements) trades strict neutrality for a detail-forward presentation; rational overall, but not the most neutral option in class.

## Advice

If you want a rugged, serviceable, open-back with strong imaging and easy drivability, the DT 900 PRO X is an excellent choice. Expect a bright top end; if you’re treble-sensitive or require stricter neutrality for reference checks, start with a gentle shelf/peak EQ around the 6–12 kHz region or consider the Sennheiser HD 560S as a lower-cost neutral benchmark [1][2][7]. If you need isolation, look at the sibling DT 700 PRO X.
