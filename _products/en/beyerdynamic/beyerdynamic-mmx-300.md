## Overview

The beyerdynamic MMX 300 (2nd generation) is a premium wired gaming headset made in Germany. It’s derived from the DT 770 lineage and uses 32 Ω dynamic drivers, a **non-detachable** boom **condenser** microphone, and two included **detachable** cables (1.2 m for consoles, 2.5 m for PC) for multi-platform use. It targets users who favor robust build and traditional wired simplicity over features like wireless connectivity or software DSP [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Independent measurements show a sound profile with notable deviations from neutral—specifically a dip in the lower mids (~200–500 Hz) and a pronounced 6–8 kHz treble peak that can add sharpness at higher volumes [2]. Manufacturer data lists **frequency response 5–35,000 Hz**, **impedance 32 Ω**, **nominal SPL 96 dB**, **THD < 0.2%**, and **ambient noise attenuation ≈ 18 dBA**; mic FR is **30–18,000 Hz** [1]. While overall fidelity is acceptable for gaming, the elevated treble and average isolation keep it short of “transparent” performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The MMX 300 employs mature dynamic-driver tech and sturdy materials with precise assembly. However, it lacks contemporary features seen in rivals (ANC, wireless, on-board DSP/EQ). The conservative 32 Ω tuning aids easy driveability but does not represent a technical leap [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Using current market pricing, **MMX 300 = 229 USD** (denominator). As the **cheapest equal-or-better comparator**, **HyperX Cloud III (wired)** is widely available at **79.99 USD** on the official store [3].  
**Equivalence note:** Both are wired, closed-back headsets with boom mics; third-party testing reports the Cloud III’s frequency response as more balanced with comparable passive isolation, and low distortion for both [2].  
**CP = 79.99 USD ÷ 229 USD ≈ 0.35 → 0.3.**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

beyerdynamic advertises **up to 2-year** warranty on the product page, and its robust construction and replaceable parts support longevity [2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing build quality and basic wired reliability is rational, but without measurable fidelity advantages over cheaper wired rivals—or modern conveniences—the design philosophy is only moderately compelling for most gamers.

## Advice

If you specifically want a German-built wired headset and can tolerate a bright treble tilt, the MMX 300 is solid. Most buyers, however, will get similar or better measured performance and the same core functions for far less with the HyperX Cloud III. If you need wireless, software EQ, or ANC, look elsewhere.
