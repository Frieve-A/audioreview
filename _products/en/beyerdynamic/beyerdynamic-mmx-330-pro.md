## Overview

The Beyerdynamic MMX 330 Pro is an open-back gaming headset that brings the company’s STELLAR.45 studio drivers to gaming. Released in 2024, it’s rated 48-ohm, 96 dB SPL @1 mW, and weighs 318 g. It uses a fixed cardioid condenser boom microphone (the *cable* is detachable) and targets gamers who want the spatial advantages of an open-back with a broadcast-style mic and replaceable pads/headband. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Key manufacturer specs are published: headphone FR 5–40,000 Hz, THD < 0.05 % at 500 Hz, 96 dB SPL @1 mW; mic FR 20–20,000 Hz, cardioid pattern. Test conditions are stated in the datasheet and manual. However, as of the review date we found no independent lab measurements (e.g., RTINGS/ASR/Erin) for MMX 330 Pro to corroborate these numbers, so the scientific basis rests mainly on official documents (average = 0.5). [1][2][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

STELLAR.45 dynamic drivers from Beyerdynamic’s studio line, open-back acoustics for a wide stage, and a fixed back-electret cardioid boom mic constitute a solid, contemporary feature set. Replaceable pads/headband and a detachable single-sided cable are practical. It’s competent rather than groundbreaking—largely an adaptation of proven studio tech to a gaming headset. [1][2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Denominator (review target price, US market)**: 299.99 USD (B&H/AUDIO46). [4][5]

**Cheapest equivalent-or-better means (numerator)**: Philips SHP9500 open-back headphone + V-MODA BoomPro X boom mic.
- SHP9500: widely measured with good FR accuracy and very high sensitivity (111.9 dB SPL measured by RTINGS), suitable for gaming when paired with a boom mic. [6]
- Current lowest new price checked: 79.98 USD (Amazon 3rd-party new, price history tracker). [9]
- BoomPro X official price: 24.99 USD. [7]

**CP calculation (single cheapest bundle)**  
104.97 ÷ 299.99 = **0.35** → rounded to **0.4**.  
This bundle delivers equivalent user-facing functions (open-back audio + boom mic with in-line mute/volume) and credible measured performance for the headphone half, at nearly one-third the cost. [6][7][9]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Made in Germany; detachable cable; user-replaceable pads/headband (documented in the manual). Beyerdynamic provides a **2-year limited warranty** and maintains spare-parts catalogs and repair channels. These factors support above-average reliability and service expectations. [2][10][11][12]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design focuses on legitimate, measurable benefits (open-back stage, studio-grade drivers, cardioid boom mic). Pricing, however, isn’t justified by proportionally superior, independently verified performance over cheaper open-back + boom-mic setups. With no published third-party measurements yet, the premium appears driven more by build/brand than by demonstrable acoustic gains.

## Advice

If you specifically want an **integrated open-back headset with a fixed boom mic**, the MMX 330 Pro is one of the very few modern options and is comfortable, well built, and easy to service. If your priority is value, the SHP9500 + BoomPro X route offers comparable functionality and measured competence for far less money. For isolation-sensitive use, consider closed-back alternatives (e.g., MMX 300 Pro) instead of relying on an open-back.
