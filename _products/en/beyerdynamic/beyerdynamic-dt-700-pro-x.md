## Overview

The DT 700 PRO X is a closed-back studio monitor that debuts beyerdynamic’s **STELLAR.45** driver and emphasizes serviceability: a detachable **3-pin mini-XLR** cable, replaceable velour pads, and a robust spring-steel headband[1]. The official product page reiterates the **48-ohm** design aimed at broad device compatibility and lists key specs and replaceable parts[4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Verified technical data specify **THD @1 mW of 0.40% (100 Hz), 0.05% (500 Hz), 0.04% (1 kHz)**, **nominal SPL 100 dB (@1 mW/500 Hz; 114 dB @1 V/500 Hz)**, **48 Ω**, **5–40,000 Hz** bandwidth, **5.3 N** clamping force, **350 g** weight, and **20 dB A** ambient noise attenuation (manufacturer spec)[1]. Third-party measurements report **efficiency ~103 dB/mW (117 dB/V)** and **measured impedance ~48 Ω**, supporting easy drivability from modest sources[2]. Together these indicate appropriately low distortion and robust sensitivity for a closed-back monitor.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

STELLAR.45 combines a strong neodymium motor, a lightweight voice coil, and a three-layer diaphragm with integrated damping to target high efficiency and low distortion at **48 Ω**[1]. The maintainable design (mini-XLR cable, replaceable pads/headband) and spring-steel frame fit professional workflows[1][4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

A representative US street price is **239 USD** for the DT 700 PRO X (manufacturer store listing)[5]. The **cheapest equal-or-better** comparator is **AKG K371**, a wired closed-back studio model with third-party-verified accurate FR and low distortion[3]. A major US retailer lists K371 at **185 USD**[6].  
CP = 185 ÷ 239 ≈ 0.77 → **0.8**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The brand provides up to a **2-year warranty** on new products; **cables carry 3-month** coverage[7]. Genuine **spare parts** (e.g., **EDT 700 PRO X** pads) are available directly from the manufacturer, supporting long-term serviceability[8][9].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Lowering impedance to **48 Ω** while maintaining low THD addresses real-world drivability across laptops/interfaces without exotic amps[1][4]. The closed-back shell and modular parts reflect a pragmatic, workflow-first approach.

## Advice

Choose the DT 700 PRO X if you want a serviceable, comfort-forward closed-back with neutral-leaning, controlled bass for tracking and editing. If pure **value** is your priority, the **AKG K371** offers comparable monitoring performance at a lower price[3][6]. Opt for the DT 700 PRO X if you value velour comfort, build quality, and an established spare-parts pipeline.
