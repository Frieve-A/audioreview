## Overview

The Beyerdynamic T1 2nd Generation represents the flagship of Beyerdynamic's premium headphone lineup, featuring the company's proprietary Tesla technology with a powerful neodymium magnet system. Released in 2015 at 1,049 USD, this semi-open circumaural headphone showcases German craftsmanship with handmade construction at Beyerdynamic's Heilbronn headquarters. The T1 2nd Generation introduced detachable cables and refined acoustics compared to its predecessor, targeting audiophiles seeking premium build quality and the distinctive Tesla driver technology. However, the product has been discontinued and replaced by the 3rd generation model.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Measurement data reveals significant performance issues that place the T1 2nd Generation between problematic and transparent levels. Frequency response measurements show approximately flat response from 50Hz to 1kHz, but suffer from a prominent +6dB peak at 8kHz that affects upper frequency balance, while bass response drops below 100Hz [1][2]. The official THD specification of 0.05% is contradicted by actual measurements showing 2nd harmonic distortion exceeding 1% at 45Hz, significantly worse than the 0.1% problematic threshold [3]. The 600-ohm nominal impedance rises to approximately 910 ohms in bass frequencies, creating substantial drive challenges for most sources [4]. These measurement deviations from neutral response and distortion issues prevent transparent sound reproduction.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The T1 2nd Generation incorporates Beyerdynamic's proprietary Tesla technology, featuring a strong neodymium magnet system that achieves magnetic flux density exceeding one tesla unit. This in-house developed technology represents genuine engineering innovation with precision fabric replacing standard non-woven materials for optimized airflow conditions. The 45mm Tesla drivers are individually measured and matched at Beyerdynamic's German facility, demonstrating technical sophistication in manufacturing processes. However, Tesla technology was introduced approximately 15 years ago, making it established but no longer cutting-edge. The purely analog/mechanical approach lacks integration with modern digital signal processing, computer integration, or advanced software features that characterize contemporary high-end audio products.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Current market prices for used T1 2nd Generation units range around 280 USD, while the HiFiMan HE400se provides equivalent-or-better open-back sound reproduction at 149 USD. The HE400se offers planar magnetic technology with superior linearity, 20-35kHz frequency response covering the audible spectrum adequately, and comparable over-ear open-back design. CP = 149 USD รท 280 USD = 0.532. This calculation demonstrates that equivalent performance is available for approximately half the cost, representing moderate value in the current used market where planar magnetic technology delivers competitive measured performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The T1 2nd Generation benefits from an exceptional 5-year warranty period, significantly longer than the industry-standard 2 years [5]. German manufacturing ensures robust construction with high-quality materials and a simple dynamic driver design inherently resistant to failure. Beyerdynamic maintains a global manufacturer support system with established service networks and reasonable repair processing times of 2-3 working days plus shipping. However, the product's discontinued status raises concerns about long-term parts availability and future support duration. The company's established track record in professional audio provides confidence in support infrastructure, though firmware updates are not applicable to this passive design.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Beyerdynamic's approach emphasizes traditional German engineering and premium materials over measurable performance optimization. The Tesla technology represents historical innovation but the design philosophy has become conservative, lacking integration with modern DSP, software features, or digital technologies that could address measured performance issues. Significant costs are attributed to premium materials and German manufacturing rather than improvements in frequency response linearity or distortion reduction. The persistence of measurement issues like >1% THD at low frequencies suggests insufficient focus on achieving transparent performance levels. Claims of "musicality" and "warmth" without corresponding measurement improvements indicate departure from purely scientific sound quality optimization.

## Advice

The T1 2nd Generation appeals to enthusiasts valuing German craftsmanship and Tesla technology heritage, with current used market prices around 280 USD making it more accessible than original retail pricing. Potential buyers should consider that equivalent or superior sound quality is available at approximately half the cost through modern planar magnetic alternatives like the HE400se. The exceptional 5-year warranty provides value for those specifically wanting Beyerdynamic's house sound and build quality. However, the high impedance requires substantial amplification, and the discontinued status may complicate future parts availability. Those prioritizing measured performance per dollar would benefit from planar magnetic alternatives, while users seeking the unique Tesla driver character may find reasonable value in the current used market.
