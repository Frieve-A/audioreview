## Overview

The Beyerdynamic TYGR 300 R is an open-back, wired gaming headphone built in Germany. It uses a 32-ohm system for easy drive and applies a specially developed **acoustic fleece**—an adaptation of the DT 990 PRO’s frequency-response concept, optimized for gaming spatial cues [1][7]. Technical data include 5–35,000 Hz bandwidth, nominal SPL 96 dB, and 290 g weight without cable [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specifications state FR 5–35 kHz and THD <0.2% at 1 mW/500 Hz [1]. Third-party measurements show good unit matching and a tuning that reduces DT 990-type treble sharpness but remains **non-flat** with a mild bass/treble lift and warmer mids; i.e., not fully transparent by neutral targets [2]. Given these data and the open-back nature (low isolation), the TYGR 300 R delivers competent, audibly clean playback but falls short of transparency benchmarks typical for reference-flat headphones.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design builds on Beyerdynamic’s established dynamic-driver architecture and DT-line know-how, adding a targeted acoustic-fleece damping to improve gaming localization and reduce fatigue [1][7]. It’s a rational, incremental refinement rather than a novel transducer technology, executed with solid materials and consistent manufacturing.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**Current market price (review target):** 229 USD (official store) [1].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **Philips SHP9500**, typically ~80 USD new in the US market (recent representative pricing) [5][6].  
**Equivalence note:** Open-back, 32-ohm, neutral-leaning midband; third-party data indicate balanced FR and low distortion suitable for gaming and music, i.e., user-facing functions and core measured performance are equivalent-or-better for most use cases [3][4].

**CP calculation:** 80 USD ÷ 229 USD = **0.35** → **0.3** (rounded to one decimal).  
Result: TYGR 300 R faces strong CP headwinds versus cheaper open-back options that achieve similar functional/measured outcomes.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Made in Germany with robust build (velour pads, fixed 1.6 m cable), simple passive design (no firmware/battery risks), and **up to 2-year warranty** with manufacturer support channels [1][6]. Long parts availability and a large installed base further support maintainability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Prioritizing measurable changes (acoustic-fleece damping, open-back stage) to aid spatial perception is a rational, evidence-aligned approach for gaming [1][7]. Costs are directed to construction and tuning rather than cosmetic “gaming” features; claims are consistent with measurable FR behavior [2].

## Advice

Choose the TYGR 300 R if you value German build quality, comfort, and Beyerdynamic’s refined take on a DT-inspired gaming tuning. For most buyers, however, the **SHP9500** provides very similar functional/measured results for roughly one-third the money, making it the default value recommendation unless you specifically want the TYGR’s construction and long-term durability [3][4][5]. If you already own a neutral open-back, meaningful upgrades should focus on **objective** improvements (fit, isolation needs, or verified measurement gains) rather than brand lineage.
