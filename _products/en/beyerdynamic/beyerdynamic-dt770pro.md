## Overview

The beyerdynamic DT770 PRO is a closed-back studio monitor headphone from the established German audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1937. It is the current model in the DT770 series, which has a long history dating back to the 1980s, available in three impedance specifications: 32Ω, 80Ω, and 250Ω. Known for its robust design intended for professional use and comfortable fit with velour ear pads, it has a proven track record of being used worldwide in studio recording and monitoring applications for many years.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Evaluating the DT770 PRO's measurement data, the frequency response covers a wide range of 5Hz-35kHz with excellent low-frequency extension. The actual sensitivity of the 80Ω version is 106 dB SPL, exceeding the nominal 96dB specification. THD is specified as less than 0.2%, which is an acceptable level for headphones. Isolation performance provides approximately 19dBA of attenuation. However, in the high-frequency characteristics, measurements confirm peaks up to +10dB, showing deviation from flat characteristics. The midrange is relatively good, but the overall frequency balance cannot be considered completely neutral. From a scientific validity perspective, while there are no issues in the audible range, it falls short of the ideal transparent level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The DT770 PRO employs a 40mm dynamic driver with quality control through manual assembly in Germany. The magnetic circuit design and voice coil design are solid, utilizing mature technology based on years of experience. However, compared to recent cutting-edge technology, no particularly innovative elements are found. The three-model lineup with different impedances provides options according to usage, but the basic design has been carried over from decades ago. In terms of housing design and driver technology, it remains at an average level when viewed from current technical standards, with limited technical advantages compared to other manufacturers' latest models.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The current price of the DT770 PRO (80Ω) is 199 USD. Equivalent closed-back studio monitor headphones include the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x (75 USD) and Sony MDR-7506 (75 USD). These competing products offer equivalent or better measurement performance in THD<0.3%, frequency response ±3dB, SNR>100dB, and are widely used in professional applications. As comparison calculations, with the ATH-M40x: 75 USD ÷ 199 USD ≈ 0.38; with the MDR-7506: 75 USD ÷ 199 USD ≈ 0.38, averaging to 0.38, rounded to 0.4. The ATH-M40x has an advantage in practicality with its detachable cable design. At the current price point, cost-performance is significantly inferior to competing products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As an established manufacturer founded in 1937, beyerdynamic has a certain level of reliability in the industry. The DT770 series has a history of over 40 years and has been used in many studios. Standard warranty periods are provided with parts replacement services available. However, domestic support structure is limited, and repair response and parts procurement may take time. For long-term use wear of ear pads and headbands, replacement parts are provided, but prices are relatively expensive. While reliability is higher compared to emerging manufacturers, support levels are average for a global brand.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The DT770 PRO's design has a clear purpose for studio monitoring applications, with a fundamentally rational direction. Essential elements for professional use are covered, including closed-back design emphasizing isolation and multiple impedance options for application-specific optimization. However, the peak high-frequency characteristics confirmed in measurements deviate from the ideal of flat reproduction, falling short of complete realization of the design philosophy. Additionally, the conservative approach of maintaining the basic design for nearly 40 years may not fully utilize the benefits of technological progress. Modern measurement techniques and advanced methods like DSP optimization are not adopted, keeping rationality at a standard level.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the DT770 PRO, we strongly recommend first comparing alternative products in the same price range. The Audio-Technica ATH-M40x (75 USD) and Sony MDR-7506 (75 USD) provide equivalent functionality for professional use at less than one-third the price, with no decisive disadvantages in measurement performance (THD, frequency response, SNR, etc.). The ATH-M40x particularly has an advantage in practicality with its detachable cable design. The DT770 PRO purchase becomes rational only in cases of special attachment to the beyerdynamic brand or specific studio environment matching requirements. For general studio monitoring applications, choosing competing products with superior cost-performance would be wise. The scientific basis is insufficient to accept this price difference expecting sound quality advantages.
