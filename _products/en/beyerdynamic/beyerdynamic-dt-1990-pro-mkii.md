## Overview

The beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO MKII is the second generation of the acclaimed DT 1990 PRO studio headphone. Launched in late 2024, this premium open-back model introduces the TESLA.45 driver and a reduced nominal impedance (30 Ω), targeting critical production work—mixing, mastering, and detailed editing—while maintaining German build quality [4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent, standardized testing reports excellent measured performance. On RTINGS’ Test Bench 2.0, the MKII shows **very low harmonic distortion** with tight stereo matching and group delay below audibility across the band; its mid-range tracks the target closely, though treble fluctuations can alternate perceived articulation and brightness [2]. The manufacturer specifies **30 Ω** nominal impedance and provides two earpad sets optimized for producing and for mixing/mastering, supporting practical workflow choices [4].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

TESLA.45 is a ground-up 45 mm dynamic driver revision focused on efficiency (30 Ω), reduced distortion, and improved transient behavior. The package includes two pad sets (“Producing Velours” and “Mixing & Mastering Velours”), straight and coiled cables, and a hard case; parts are serviceable and assembly is in Germany [4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Value baseline (equal-or-better in function & measured performance):** **Sennheiser HD 490 PRO — USD 399** (B&H) [5]. On the same RTINGS bench, the HD 490 PRO deliver **low distortion** at both 94 and 104 dB SPL, **group delay below audibility**, and **fewer treble fluctuations** than the MKII while targeting the same open-back studio use and also including two pad sets [1][2].  
**DT 1990 PRO MKII street price (new):** **USD 699.99** (beyerdynamic official) [3].  
**CP ratio:** 399 / 699.99 = **0.57 → score 0.6**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Metal yokes, replaceable pads/cables, and robust construction support long service life; a hard case is included and service parts are available through the brand’s network [4].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Changes prioritize measurable performance (distortion, matching, transient behavior) and practical studio ergonomics (lower impedance, two pad sets), aligning with professional requirements [2][4].

## Advice

If you prefer beyerdynamic’s build/fit and want low distortion with excellent matching, the MKII is easy to recommend [2][4]. If your priority is **measured transparency per dollar**, **HD 490 PRO at USD 399** sets a strong value bar with equal-or-better lab results in several key metrics [1].
