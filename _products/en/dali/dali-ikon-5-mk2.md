## Overview

The Ikon 5 MK2 is a compact 2.5-way floorstander from DALI’s Ikon MK2 line, now discontinued [1]. It uses a hybrid tweeter module (28 mm soft dome + 17×45 mm ribbon) and two 5-inch wood-fibre cone woofers in a bass-reflex cabinet. With base, dimensions are 838 × 150 × 280 mm and 10.4 kg per speaker [1]. DALI’s own papers describe the MK2 updates as improving bass and overall dynamics while keeping wide dispersion up top [2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications state frequency range 43 Hz–30 kHz (±3 dB), sensitivity 87 dB (2.83 V/1 m), nominal impedance 6 Ω, and max SPL 108 dB [1][3]. These numbers are adequate for compact towers but do not demonstrate transparent-level linearity or distortion performance by strict lab criteria. We could not locate credible third-party anechoic FR/THD data for Ikon 5 MK2; therefore, claims remain unverified beyond catalog specs and the score remains at the “average/unknown” baseline [1][2][3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Engineering is above average for its era: the hybrid tweeter (dome for power handling + ribbon for HF dispersion) is a rational, well-documented DALI design choice [1][2]. The cabinet uses a dual-layer baffle and bracing, and the crossover is hand-mounted to reduce vibration coupling [1][2]. While not state-of-the-art today, the design shows thoughtful implementation that still compares well with modern budget towers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Denominator (review target price):** 475 USD (representative used-market level around the review date; see recent MK2 listings) [6].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** *Monitor Audio Silver RS6* at 250 USD on the used market (pair; Audiogon listing noted on Aug 12, 2025) [5]. The RS6 is functionally equivalent as a compact 2.5-way tower and **measured** by Stereophile with ~89.5 dB sensitivity and a benign load; bass extension is effectively to ~40 Hz, matching or exceeding the Ikon 5 MK2 claims [4].  
**CP calculation:** 250 USD ÷ 475 USD = 0.53 → **0.5** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The model is discontinued [1], and as a passive loudspeaker there are no firmware or software updates. General manufacturer support for discontinued series is limited, and parts (e.g., hybrid tweeter modules) are obtainable only through third-party/used channels. DALI maintains a discontinued-products area but does not guarantee parts availability for legacy models [6][7].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

DALI prioritizes wide dispersion and smooth HF behavior via the hybrid tweeter, rolling in the ribbon above ~10 kHz and keeping the dome in control of the heavy lifting—an approach supported by DALI’s technical notes [2]. Materials (wood-fibre cones), moderate sensitivity, and compact footprint are consistent with measurable benefits rather than occult claims. Absent independent measurements for this exact model, the philosophy still reads as methodical and technically coherent.

## Advice

For buyers seeking a slim used tower with airy treble and wide dispersion, the Ikon 5 MK2 remains attractive. Inspect ribbons and domes closely (and budget for potential tweeter module replacement) due to discontinuation. If pure value is the goal, the Monitor Audio Silver RS6 typically undercuts the Ikon 5 MK2 on the used market while meeting or exceeding key performance indicators (sensitivity, bass reach) and with documented third-party measurements [4][5]. Choose the DALI if you specifically want its hybrid-tweeter presentation and compact 150 mm baffle width.
