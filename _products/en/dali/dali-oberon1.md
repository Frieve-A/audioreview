## Overview

The DALI Oberon 1 is an entry-level compact bookshelf speaker crafted by DALI, the renowned Danish speaker manufacturer. Featuring a 5.25-inch wood fiber cone woofer and 29mm soft dome tweeter in a 2-way bass reflex design, it achieves a frequency response of 51Hz-26kHz. Advanced technologies derived from higher-tier models are incorporated, including SMC (Soft Magnetic Composite) technology for distortion reduction and wide directivity design.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The frequency response of 51Hz-26kHz (±3dB) represents standard performance for a bookshelf speaker. While it doesn't reach the full 20Hz-20kHz range, this is reasonable considering the compact enclosure size. SMC technology effectively reduces harmonic distortion, with particularly significant reduction in third-order distortion confirmed. The 86dB sensitivity is average, with a 6-ohm impedance providing easy drive characteristics. Due to limited measurement data availability, detailed evaluation is challenging, but the speaker demonstrates above-average scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

DALI's proprietary SMC (Soft Magnetic Composite) technology is applied to the woofer magnet assembly, suppressing magnetic flux disturbances to achieve distortion reduction. The adoption of a large 29mm tweeter reduces diaphragm excursion, minimizing distortion generation. The wood fiber cone, made from paper pulp mixed with wood fibers, achieves an optimal balance of internal damping and lightweight construction. The crossover frequency of 2.8kHz is appropriately set, with wide directivity design providing greater freedom in listening position. Technical innovations that surpass industry average levels are evident.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The actual market price is approximately 750 USD. The KEF Q150 (350 USD) is selected as the comparison product with equivalent functionality and performance. The Q150 is similarly a passive 2-way bookshelf speaker featuring a 5.25-inch woofer and 1-inch tweeter, with a frequency response of 51Hz-28kHz. Both require separate amplification and provide equivalent functionality. From a functionality and measurement performance perspective: 350 USD ÷ 750 USD = 0.47, evaluated as 0.5. In terms of pure cost-performance, more affordable alternatives exist.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

DALI holds an established position as a Danish speaker manufacturer founded in 1983. Products come with standard warranty coverage, supported through domestic authorized distributor networks. The Oberon series represents the company's volume production model with stable manufacturing quality. While no exceptionally extended warranty periods or innovative support services are offered, industry-standard levels of reliability and support are provided.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The wide directivity design for natural soundfield reproduction and SMC technology for distortion reduction represent scientifically grounded rational approaches. The bass reflex design to extend low-frequency response in a compact enclosure is also a reasonable choice. The adoption of wood fiber cones achieves an appropriate balance of damping and lightweight construction, making material selection rational. However, compared to modern active speakers and DSP correction technology, it remains within conventional passive design approaches. While design philosophy aimed at achieving measurement transparency levels is confirmed, more innovative approaches also exist.

## Advice

The DALI Oberon 1 is an ambitious product that generously incorporates technologies derived from higher-tier models into a compact enclosure. Through SMC technology for distortion reduction and wide directivity design, it achieves sound quality that exceeds its price point. However, from a cost-performance perspective, alternatives like the KEF Q150 exist that offer equivalent or superior performance at lower prices. This becomes a meaningful choice for those who value DALI's acoustic design and aesthetic appeal, or for long-term use with future amplifier upgrades in mind. For those prioritizing pure performance-to-price ratio, considering other alternatives is recommended.
