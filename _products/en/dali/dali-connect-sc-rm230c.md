## Overview

The DALI Connect SC RM230C is a premium speaker cable designed to complement DALI's loudspeaker systems [1]. Featuring 74 strands of 3.0mm² oxygen-free copper (OFC) conductors with polyethylene insulation and concentric stranding construction, the cable includes carbon-cased cable splitters and rhodium-plated banana plugs [1]. Available in mechanically tuned lengths of 2m, 3m, and 4m, the SC RM230C represents DALI's entry into the dedicated cable market with claims of minimizing microphonic effects and providing low-distortion signal paths [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

This high-priced cable product claims audible sound quality improvements without ABX blind test evidence or equivalent scientific validation [2]. The DALI Connect SC RM230C is priced at 340 USD (2m length), significantly above basic cable pricing, while marketing materials include claims such as "minimize microphonic effects" and "low-distortion path for audio signals" [1]. No third-party measurement data is provided for critical specifications including resistance, capacitance, or inductance values, nor is there controlled testing evidence demonstrating audible differences compared to standard cables [2]. According to measurement criteria for high-priced products claiming audible improvements without scientific validation, the Scientific Validity score is set to 0.0.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The DALI Connect SC RM230C employs standard cable technology with limited differentiation. The oxygen-free copper construction represents conventional conductor technology, while the concentric stranding with polyethylene insulation follows established cable engineering principles. The carbon-cased cable splitters provide minor technological differentiation, though rhodium-plated banana plugs are standard in premium connector applications. The purely analog/mechanical construction lacks cutting-edge technology adoption, with no integration of digital, software, or advanced materials science. The technology is easily replicable with no significant competitive advantage or technical barriers for new entrants.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The DALI Connect SC RM230C (2m, 340 USD converted from UK pricing) provides speaker cable connectivity with 3.0mm² conductor cross-section and professional termination [1]. QED Performance Original Speaker Cable offers equivalent functionality with 2 × 2.50mm² conductor area, 99.999% oxygen-free copper construction, and complete measured specifications (resistance 0.015 Ω/m, capacitance 35 pF/m, inductance 0.59 µH/m) at 8.60 USD for 2m length [4]. Equipped with equivalent conductor area and superior measured performance data, QED Performance Original provides equivalent-or-better functionality and specifications. CP = 8.60 USD ÷ 340 USD = 0.025

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

DALI provides a 1-year warranty period, below the industry standard of 2 years [5]. The simple cable construction with no moving parts offers inherent robustness against mechanical failure. Technical support operates through DALI's dealer network with response times of 2-5 business days [3]. As an established manufacturer, DALI demonstrates a track record of product support, though warranty claims and service requests require coordination through local dealers rather than direct manufacturer support [3]. The cable's passive construction minimizes potential failure points, contributing to overall reliability expectations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates significant departures from rational cost-effectiveness principles. The majority of the product's cost appears unrelated to measurable performance improvements, with marketing claims of audible effects for scientifically questionable elements. The product represents high-priced cable positioning where general-purpose products provide equivalent function at substantially lower cost. Significant cost investment shows no corresponding performance benefits in measured specifications, while standard technology implementation results in premium pricing without superior performance demonstration. The approach reflects conservative cable design with premium positioning rather than innovative engineering solutions.

## Advice

For users seeking speaker cables, prioritize products with published electrical specifications (resistance, capacitance, inductance) and adequate conductor cross-section for your amplifier-speaker combination. Standard cables from QED, Mogami, or Canare provide transparent signal transmission with complete technical documentation at fraction of premium cable pricing. If aesthetic preferences favor premium terminations, consider cables with measured performance data demonstrating electrical transparency. Focus purchasing decisions on amplifier and speaker performance where significant audible improvements are scientifically validated, rather than on cable upgrades beyond basic electrical requirements.
