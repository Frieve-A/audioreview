## Overview

The KLH Model Five is a modern revival of the legendary 3-way large standmount speaker (supplied with dedicated angled stands) that was produced from 1968 to 1977. KLH was founded in 1957 by Henry Kloss, Malcolm S. Low, and Josef Anton Hofmann, establishing itself as a pioneer of acoustic-suspension technology. The current Model Five represents one of the products brought back to life in 2018 under David Kelley, who acquired the company in 2017, faithfully maintaining the original cabinet dimensions and 3-way acoustic-suspension design philosophy.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Stereophile lab data reports an estimated free-field sensitivity of 87.9 dB/2.83V/m, versus the manufacturer’s in-room 90.5 dB figure. Nominal impedance is 6Ω, with a minimum around 3.7Ω (circa 122 Hz). Being a sealed (acoustic-suspension) system, the low-frequency roll-off is approximately 12 dB/octave, with useful extension to roughly 42 Hz (−3 dB) and 32 Hz (−10 dB). These third-party numbers substantiate industry-standard, scientifically sound performance without reaching transparency-level benchmarks [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While incorporating modern materials such as aluminum dome tweeters and die-cast aluminum frame mid/woofers, the fundamental design remains a conventional 3-way configuration. Though the acoustic-suspension approach is acoustically rational, there are no industry-leading innovative technologies present. It lacks technical advantages that other manufacturers would desire to adopt, placing it below industry average levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.60} $$

US street price for the Model Five is 1,998 USD/pair (manufacturer stated). As an equal‑or‑better measured alternative at a substantially lower regular price, we select Emotiva Airmotiv T2+ (passive 3‑way, 1,199 USD/pair list). Third‑party measurements show good linearity/directivity and comparable or better low‑frequency extension [2]. Therefore, CP = 1,199 ÷ 1,998 = 0.60 (based on regular pricing; sale pricing excluded).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The manufacturer states a 10-year warranty for loudspeakers. Under the experienced management of David Kelley, the customer support and supply chain have been stable since the company’s 2018 relaunch, suggesting above-average reliability in market terms.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The acoustic-suspension approach is scientifically valid, with no unscientific claims or "occult audio" elements whatsoever. It represents solid design with emphasis on traditional methods, being acoustically and engineering-wise rational. However, it falls short of achieving performance improvements or price disruption through innovative approaches, remaining at the level expected of general audio products.

## Advice

The Model Five suits tradition-oriented users seeking solid sound and long-term warranty coverage. If prioritizing price-to-measured-performance, consider Arendal 1961 Tower at around 1,498 USD/pair as an equal-or-better measured alternative at lower cost. If you prefer the sealed-box tonality or value KLH’s heritage, the Model Five remains a compelling choice.
