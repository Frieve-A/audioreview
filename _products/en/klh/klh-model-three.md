## Overview

The KLH Model Three is a modern take on the classic acoustic-suspension two-way bookshelf speaker, pairing a 1-inch aluminum-dome tweeter with an 8-inch pulp-paper cone woofer in a sealed enclosure. It sells for 1,800 USD per pair in the U.S. and ships with powder-coated 14-gauge steel slant riser bases[11].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs list 46Hz–20kHz (±3dB), free-field sensitivity 85dB/2.83V/m, and minimum impedance 3.7Ω at 320Hz[2]. Independent measurements show the midrange is shelved ~3–5dB vs the tweeter, a small ~700Hz peak, classic sealed 12dB/octave LF roll-off, and a demanding EPDR minimum of ~1.9Ω at ~304Hz[1]. The three-position Acoustic Balance switch is nominally 0/−1.5/−3.0dB above 400Hz (per manual), with an observed effect of roughly ±1dB in Stereophile’s data[1][2]. Overall, it achieves basic competence but not transparency.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Conventional sealed 2-way architecture with a 2nd-order 1.5kHz crossover[2]. Construction is reinforced MDF with a die-cast woofer frame and a machined-aluminum tweeter faceplate; the network uses 13 components (iron-core inductors/Mylar caps)[11]. Solid, proven engineering choices, but no notable proprietary advances.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A cheaper, equal-or-better comparator is the **ELAC Debut Reference DBR62** (2-way bass-reflex; 44Hz–35kHz; 86dB; neutral spin per independent NFS testing)[4][5][10]. As of August 2025 its U.S. market price is **799 USD**[6][7].  
**Cost-performance calculation: 799 USD ÷ 1,800 USD = 0.44.**  
(For context: KEF **LS50 Meta** is 1,599.99 USD MSRP in the U.S.[9].)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

KLH advertises a **10-year warranty** on passive speakers (registration within 120 days required), which is longer than typical for this category[3][11][12]. No widespread reliability issues have surfaced since launch.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The acoustic-suspension approach is scientifically sound for controlled bass and easier room integration, but here it’s a careful application of established practice rather than innovation. Pricing emphasizes heritage design and bundled stands more than measurable superiority.

## Advice

Buy it if you value the sealed-box presentation, mid-century styling, and included stands as part of the experience. If you’re optimizing for measured performance per dollar, the ELAC DBR62 provides comparable functionality and objective balance at less than half the price.
