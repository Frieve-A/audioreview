## Overview

The KLH Kendall is a discontinued 3-way bass-reflex floorstanding loudspeaker that was designed as a flagship model named after Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The speaker features dual 6.5-inch woven Kevlar bass drivers, a 5.25-inch woven Kevlar midrange driver, and a 1-inch anodized aluminum tweeter with crossover points at 800Hz and 2.5kHz. Constructed with 0.75-inch MDF cabinet and powder-coated die-cast aluminum driver baskets, the Kendall was offered in real wood veneer finishes including Black Oak and American Walnut. KLH Audio represents the 2017 revival of the historic KLH brand under new ownership, emphasizing the democratization of high-quality audio that founder Henry Kloss originally championed.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be comprehensively evaluated due to insufficient independent measurement data. While manufacturer specifications indicate frequency response of 25Hz-23kHz ±3dB, sensitivity of 96dB in-room (93dB/2.83V/m anechoic), and 8-ohm nominal impedance with 3.2-ohm minimum [2], these claims lack independent verification through credible third-party measurements. Forum discussions reference potential performance concerns including distortion around 3kHz and tweeter ringing at 20kHz, with bass extension possibly limited to approximately 35Hz rather than the claimed 25Hz [1]. However, these represent user observations rather than formal measurement reports. The SoundStage review mentions that measurements were conducted at Canada's National Research Council, but detailed measurement data is not publicly accessible [3]. Without access to comprehensive independent measurements including frequency response deviation, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, and other critical parameters defined in measurement criteria, Scientific Validity receives a conservative baseline score pending availability of verified third-party measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The KLH Kendall employs conventional passive speaker technology without significant innovation or proprietary advancements. The design utilizes woven Kevlar drivers with butyl rubber surrounds, which represents mature, widely-available driver technology [2]. The powder-coated die-cast aluminum driver baskets with oversized magnets provide standard construction quality [2]. The 0.75-inch MDF cabinet with internal bracing optimized through finite element analysis shows appropriate engineering practices but lacks cutting-edge approaches [3]. Crossover implementation uses 2nd order (12dB/octave) slopes for tweeter/midrange and 3rd order (18dB/octave) for midrange/woofers, representing conventional design choices [2]. The technology shows no proprietary patent implementations, DSP integration, or advanced measurement-based optimization approaches that would distinguish it from numerous competitors using similar driver materials and cabinet construction methods.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The KLH Kendall was originally priced at 1,300 USD per pair as a discontinued model. The Emotiva Airmotiv T2+ serves as the primary comparison target at 999 USD per pair [4]. Equipped with equivalent floorstanding functionality, and frequency response linearity (±2.50dB on-axis) and measured low distortion characteristics are equivalent-or-better [4]. The T2+ provides professional measurements showing superior linearity within ±2.50dB on-axis, confirmed low distortion and compression characteristics, and validated performance through independent testing [4]. The 91dB sensitivity and 4-ohm impedance offer comparable amplifier compatibility, while the folded ribbon tweeter technology and measured performance data demonstrate superior audio quality despite the KLH's higher sensitivity specification.

CP = 999 USD ÷ 1,300 USD = 0.769

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

KLH Audio provides exceptional warranty coverage with 10-year parts and labor warranty, representing the longest warranty policy observed in speaker products [5]. The warranty begins from purchase date and requires product registration within 120 days for validation, covering production and material defects [5]. The company maintains comprehensive customer service infrastructure including phone support, email contact, product registration system, and technical support availability [5]. Product manuals and FAQ resources are provided through the website [5]. However, as a revival brand established in 2017 under Kelley Global Brands ownership, long-term reliability data specific to current production remains limited [6]. The simple passive speaker construction with conventional components suggests inherent reliability, though no specific failure rate data is available for this discontinued model.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The KLH Kendall follows a traditional conservative design philosophy emphasizing premium materials and classic aesthetic appeal rather than scientific performance optimization. The design philosophy centers on reproducing "the artist's original soundtrack recording with such astonishing natural detail," but lacks scientific substantiation or measurement-based validation [2]. The approach represents Henry Kloss's historical philosophy of democratizing quality audio, but the modern implementation shows no integration of contemporary technologies like DSP, measurement-based optimization, or cost-effective engineering approaches [7]. The design relies on conventional Kevlar driver technology and traditional crossover implementation without proprietary innovations or competitive technical advantages. Marketing claims about natural detail reproduction remain unsubstantiated by objective measurements, while the premium pricing approach does not translate to superior measured performance compared to more cost-effective alternatives. The conservative legacy-following approach avoids cutting-edge technologies that could improve performance-to-price ratios or provide measurable acoustic benefits.

## Advice

The KLH Kendall presents significant concerns for potential buyers due to lack of accessible independent measurement data and poor cost-performance metrics. Without comprehensive third-party measurements to verify manufacturer specifications, buyers cannot make informed decisions about actual acoustic performance. Forum discussions suggest potential performance issues including distortion concerns and limited bass extension, though these remain unverified. The Emotiva Airmotiv T2+ offers superior value at lower cost with professionally verified measurements demonstrating excellent linearity and low distortion. For buyers seeking floorstanding speakers in this price range, prioritize products with independently verified measurements and proven acoustic performance rather than relying solely on manufacturer claims or brand heritage. The discontinuation status also limits availability and potential future support considerations.
