## Overview

The Rasteme Systems RDH20 is a digital headphone amplifier released in 2010, featuring USB Sound Adapter functionality and multiple digital inputs. Originally priced at approximately 1,097 USD, this unit was positioned as a desktop headphone amplifier with advanced DAC technology for its era. The device supports headphones from 16-600Ω impedance and incorporates dual 32-bit/192kHz DACs with complete digital/analog circuit separation. However, the manufacturer Rasteme Systems declared bankruptcy in November 2013, leaving current users without official support or warranty coverage.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data. While the RDH20 demonstrates manufacturer-specified signal-to-noise ratio (123dB) and dynamic range (123dB) that would exceed the transparent level of 105dB, critical measurements including THD, IMD, and crosstalk specifications are unavailable from third-party sources. The frequency response specification of 10Hz-20kHz lacks specific deviation data necessary for proper evaluation. When compared against latest digital technology standards achieving >120dB S/N ratio, <0.01% THD, and flat frequency response within ±0.5dB across 20Hz-20kHz, the RDH20's performance cannot be reliably assessed without independent verification. Output power specifications appear adequate across the supported impedance range, from 1,200mW at 16Ω to 50mW at 600Ω. The available data appears to be manufacturer specifications rather than independently verified measurements, making comprehensive scientific evaluation impossible under current evidence standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The RDH20 featured advanced technology for 2010, incorporating dual 32-bit/192kHz DACs, complete digital/analog circuit separation, and differential analog drive implementation. The device supported 24-bit/96kHz via USB and up to 192kHz via optical/coaxial inputs with internal 32-bit/192kHz oversampling processing. Rasteme Systems demonstrated technical expertise through multiple industry awards, including the Pure Audio Grand-prix 2010 SUMMER for this product. However, this technology is now 15 years old and no longer provides competitive advantage in the current market. Modern implementations achieve equivalent or superior performance using more efficient, cost-effective approaches. The in-house design represents positive technical ownership, but the technology lacks current relevance and desirability in today's audio equipment landscape.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The RDH20's cost-performance evaluation reveals significant disadvantages compared to modern alternatives. At approximately 1,097 USD, current products provide equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance at dramatically lower prices. The SMSL DS100 is available for 89 USD with USB, optical, and coaxial digital inputs, headphone output supporting up to 600Ω impedance (7 Vrms into 600Ω, approximately 81.7 mW), S/N ratio of 127dB, and THD+N of 0.00017%. Equipped with equivalent digital input connectivity (USB/optical/coaxial) and 600Ω headphone output capability, with output power at 600Ω exceeding the RDH20's 50mW specification. The cost-performance calculation demonstrates the substantial price premium: CP = 89 USD ÷ 1,097 USD = 0.081 = 0.1. Modern integrated circuit implementations achieve the same essential functions through highly efficient design and manufacturing approaches, making the RDH20's original pricing structure significantly disadvantageous by current market standards.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Reliability and support present critical concerns for the RDH20. Rasteme Systems declared bankruptcy in November 2013, eliminating all manufacturer support, warranty coverage, and parts availability. The company, which employed 18 people and achieved 200 million yen in sales in 2011, succumbed to declining OEM production and inability to repay borrowed funds. Current owners cannot obtain official repair services, firmware updates, or replacement components. The product's 15-year age compounds these issues, as electronic components may reach end-of-life and third-party repair options become increasingly limited. While the relatively simple analog design may offer inherent durability, the complete absence of manufacturer infrastructure significantly impacts long-term reliability prospects for users.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Rasteme Systems demonstrated a rational, scientifically-oriented design philosophy focused on measurable performance improvements. The company's consistent recognition through technical excellence awards, including Audio Excellence Awards and MJ Technology of the Year honors across multiple products, indicates commitment to objective performance criteria. The measurement-focused approach to audio quality improvement aligns with scientific principles rather than subjective marketing claims. However, the extremely high cost relative to delivered performance suggests inefficient cost allocation, with majority of expenses unrelated to actual function and measurement performance improvements. Modern products achieve equivalent specifications through more cost-effective engineering approaches. While the company showed innovation in digital audio processing for its era, the pricing structure did not reflect rational cost-performance optimization that would benefit end users.

## Advice

The Rasteme Systems RDH20 represents historical significance in high-end desktop headphone amplifier development but cannot be recommended for current purchase consideration. The combination of company bankruptcy, absence of support infrastructure, and availability of superior modern alternatives at dramatically lower prices makes this product economically irrational. Potential users seeking equivalent-or-better functionality should consider current products like the SMSL DS100 available for around 89 USD, which provides equivalent digital inputs (USB/optical/coaxial), 600Ω headphone output capability, active manufacturer support, and cost savings exceeding 92%. For those specifically interested in 2010-era audio equipment for historical or collection purposes, ensure realistic expectations regarding support limitations and potential repair challenges. While the RDH20's specifications appear capable for its era, practical considerations strongly favor modern alternatives for actual use applications.
