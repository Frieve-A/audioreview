## Overview

Released in October 2019, the HA-FW1500 is a Japan-market model in JVC/Victor’s WOOD series using an 11 mm wood dome carbon diaphragm, “acoustic purifier,” detachable MMCX cable, and Hi-Res spec (6 Hz–52 kHz). Official specs list 16 Ω impedance, 103 dB/1 mW sensitivity, and 200 mW max input. It remains on the brand’s site and is sold new in Japan; representative new retail around **45,430円 (~300 USD)** has been observed. [1][5]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Objective public data are primarily frequency-response (FR) measurements on IEC60318-4 fixtures. Crinacle’s database shows the HA-FW1500 follows a warm/V-shaped tilt (not neutral/Harman-adjacent). Comprehensive public THD/IMD/isolation datasets are limited; manufacturer specs (16 Ω, 103 dB/1 mW, 6–52 kHz) are catalog values. Given the known FR trend and limited broader datasets, audible fidelity is middling rather than transparent. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The wood dome carbon diaphragm and acoustic purifier reflect proprietary materials/process know-how within a conventional single dynamic-driver architecture. It shows in-house development but lacks modern multi-driver or DSP features. Incremental, not state-of-the-art—hence a slightly-above-average score. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Price basis (this review, USD): 300 USD** (≈ new JP street 45,430円).  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **TANGZU Wan’er S.G — 17.10 USD** (wired IEM, **detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable**, third-party FR data indicates closer-to-neutral tuning than HA-FW1500’s warm/V profile). **Equivalence note:** same user-facing function (wired IEM with detachable cable); measured FR is at least as balanced; published specs indicate low distortion. [3][4][6]

**Calculation:** **17.10 ÷ 300 = 0.057 → 0.1** (rounded to one decimal).  

(Additional context: **Truthear HOLA — 18.99 USD** is similarly detachable and well-measured; although not the CP basis here, it also meets equal-or-better criteria. [6][7])

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As of today the model remains listed by Victor with **one-year warranty** via official JP channels, and multiple retailers stock it new. Construction is simple (single DD, MMCX) and serviceability aligns with typical wired IEMs. No large-scale failure data is published; ongoing official availability/warranty lifts it slightly above average. [1][5]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Pursuing natural timbre via wood diaphragms is a coherent materials-science route, yet publicly verified audible superiority over well-tuned conventional diaphragms is not established. Without clear measured advantages in FR neutrality/distortion, the approach scores neutral in rationality. [1][2]

## Advice

If you specifically want the Victor/JVC wood-toned tuning, build and aesthetics, the HA-FW1500 remains purchasable new in Japan. From a measurement-first/value standpoint, **TANGZU Wan’er S.G (17.10 USD)** is the **cheapest** equal-or-better option, and **Truthear HOLA (18.99 USD)** is another low-cost, detachable alternative with strong published FR. Unless you prioritize the wood technology/housing or brand ecosystem, the HA-FW1500’s value case is weak. Ensure proper seal/fit and check MMCX integrity on arrival. [1][3][4][5][6][7]
