## Overview

The Victor SX-DW75 launched in June 2006 as a sealed 30 cm active sub with MFB (Motional Feedback) servo control and a Class-D amplifier specified as **JEITA "practical maximum" 600 W (2 Ω, 100 Hz)**. Factory price started at 1013 USD and was later revised to 1448 USD. Its low-gloss black finish targeted home-theater use, and it received VGP awards (including VGP 2008; VGP 2006 Summer is also cited). It is now discontinued and only available used. [1][2][3][4]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Key official specs: frequency range **16 Hz–250 Hz**, sensitivity **88 dB/W·m**, sealed enclosure, variable low-pass **40–120 Hz**, magnetic shielding. The amplification figure is **JEITA “practical maximum” 600 W (2 Ω, 100 Hz)** (not continuous RMS). No comprehensive third-party THD or CEA-2010 data for the SX-DW75 could be verified; evaluation therefore relies on official specifications and assigns a neutral mid-score pending independent measurements. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

MFB servo control, a 10,000-gauss-class motor, 5-layer voice coil, and Class-D + switching PSU were advanced for its era. Relative to 2025 designs that commonly integrate DSP (limiters/EQ), app control, and automated room optimization, the DW75 lacks modern functionality and tuning flexibility. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Price basis (this review): 563 USD (used).**  
**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better found): RSL Speedwoofer 10S MKII — 501 USD (official landing page).** The 10S MKII offers equivalent user-facing integration (LFE/line-level, variable crossover/phase) and documented performance including **DSP-managed 400 W RMS amplification** and **LFE mode extension to 22 Hz**; Audioholics provides full measurement discussion (CEA-2010 referenced to 2 m RMS). In the absence of independent SX-DW75 measurements, we judge the RSL provisionally equal-or-better in practical bandwidth/output above ~20 Hz.  
Calculation (USD basis): **501 ÷ 563 = 0.89** → score **0.9** (rounded to 0.1). [5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Discontinued product with no current manufacturer warranty or parts program. Any repair depends on third-party service. Build appears robust, but age and unknown service history reduce confidence versus new subs with warranties. (General assessment.)

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Evaluated at today’s standard, the sealed-box + MFB approach is scientifically coherent for distortion control and time-domain behavior, but **lack of onboard DSP/room tools** limits the design’s ability to achieve transparent, in-room results compared with current best practice. Using AVR room EQ can partially compensate, yet the underlying product strategy is only moderately rational in 2025.

## Advice

If you can find a clean SX-DW75 at a favorable price, it can still serve in a home-theater system; pair it with your AVR’s room-EQ to offset the absence of onboard DSP. Buyers prioritizing **documented performance and modern protections** should consider the **RSL Speedwoofer 10S MKII (501 USD)** used here for CP; it delivers strong measured results and DSP-based management, albeit without app control.
