summary: "A limited edition speaker from 2004 with only 360 units produced. Despite premium materials like gold-plated drivers and Alnico magnets, the 370,000 JPY (pair) price point faces competition from modern equivalent products available at approximately one-third the cost, resulting in poor cost-performance."

## Overview

The Victor SX-LT55LTD is a limited production floor-standing speaker released by Victor on June 15, 2004, with only 360 units manufactured. Positioned as an enhanced version of the standard SX-LT55 model with improved sound quality and build quality, it incorporated premium materials and technologies considered high-end for its era, including a pure gold-plated aluminum hard dome tweeter and 12,000 Gauss Alnico magnet circuits. The speaker features a 3-way, 4-driver configuration with an oblique omni-array arrangement, representing a unique acoustic design approach.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While specific measurement data (frequency response, THD, SNR, etc.) for the SX-LT55LTD is difficult to obtain, the estimated performance based on its configuration appears limited by modern standards. The 1.9cm aluminum hard dome tweeter and 14.5cm aluminum oblicone midrange/woofer configuration was reasonable for 2004, but falls significantly short when compared to current transparent level standards (frequency response ±0.5dB, THD below 0.01%, SNR above 105dB). Physical constraints likely limit performance to approximately ±3dB frequency response and 0.1% THD levels. Given the lack of measurement data, the baseline score of 0.5 is applied.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The gold-plated drivers, 12,000 Gauss Alnico magnets, and oblique omni-array arrangement represented ambitious technological investments for 2004. However, from today's technical standards, these technologies have become obsolete. Modern speaker design employs more efficient magnetic circuit designs, advanced diaphragm materials, and DSP correction technologies as standard practice, making the 20-year-old material-focused approach technically disadvantageous. Furthermore, being a product from an era before measurement-based scientific design methodologies were established, there exists a significant gap from current technological levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Against the 370,000 JPY (pair) price point, currently available products with equivalent or superior functionality and measurement performance include the KEF Q550 (119,600 JPY, pair) and DALI Oberon 5 (134,316 JPY, pair). These modern speakers offer superior measurement performance and contemporary design philosophy. Using the most affordable alternative, the KEF Q550, the calculation yields CP = 119,600 JPY ÷ 370,000 JPY = 0.32, which rounds to 0.3. However, since the KEF Q550 is discontinued, using the currently available most affordable option, the DALI Oberon 5 (134,316 JPY, pair), yields CP = 134,316 JPY ÷ 370,000 JPY = 0.36, which rounds to 0.4.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Victor (now JVC Kenwood) maintains credibility as an established manufacturer, but this product is a limited production item from 2004, having exceeded 20 years since manufacture. Parts supply and repair support can realistically no longer be expected. Additionally, the limited production run of 360 units makes securing replacement units difficult in case of failure. While manufacturer support falls within industry average standards, the product age and limited production circumstances must be considered, making practical support systems limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The SX-LT55LTD's design philosophy is based on the 2004-era concept of "sound quality improvement through premium materials," but lacks rationality from current scientific perspectives. The effectiveness of expensive material investments like gold plating and Alnico magnets on sound quality improvement is scientifically questionable, and directing the same budget toward more effective design elements (cabinet rigidity, measurement-based frequency response optimization, DSP correction, etc.) would be more rational. Additionally, designs from 20 years ago lack optimization through modern measurement technologies and fall far short of achieving scientifically-based transparent level sound quality.

## Advice

While the SX-LT55LTD may hold value as a rare collectible or collector's item due to its limited production, it offers no clear advantages over modern alternatives when considered purely as a music reproduction device. With a budget of 370,000 JPY (pair), superior options like the KEF Q550 (119,600 JPY, pair) or DALI Oberon 5 (134,316 JPY, pair) are available, offering better measurement performance and contemporary design philosophy. These modern products provide more accurate frequency response, lower distortion, and superior support systems. For rational audio equipment selection, purchasing this product cannot be recommended. It merits consideration only for those with interest in vintage audio or collecting limited edition items.
