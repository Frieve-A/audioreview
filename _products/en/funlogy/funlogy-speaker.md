## Overview

FUNLOGY Speaker is a compact 2.0 USB-powered desktop speaker pair from the Japanese brand FUNLOGY. It uses 48 mm full-range drivers with passive radiators in a 30° upward-tilted baffle, measures 69 × 132 × 108 mm per unit at 260 g, and accepts analog input via 3.5 mm. Catalog output is “total 14 W (7 W ×2, 3.6 Ω)” and the product received a VGP 2024 SUMMER award in the desktop active speaker category. A “Max SPL 85 dB @1 m” spec is published on the US listing. [3][4][5]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

No independent third-party measurements (frequency response curves, THD, IMD, S/N) are available as of the review date. Manufacturer specs indicate 48 mm full-range drivers with passive radiators, total 14 W (7 W×2, 3.6 Ω), and Max SPL 85 dB @1 m. Given the small driver size, USB 5 V power, and lack of published low-distortion data, transparency to source is unlikely; for loudspeakers, THD ≲0.1% and ±1 dB FR are excellent, while >1% THD and wide FR deviations are problematic. Assessment remains provisional pending independent measurements. [3][5]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Design choices (single small full-range driver per channel, passive radiator, USB power, analog 3.5 mm input) are conventional and widely seen in entry-level desktop speakers. There is no evidence of proprietary driver tech, advanced waveguides, or DSP-based correction that might push state of the art. The 30° tilt is a practical placement tweak rather than a novel acoustic invention. [3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price used for evaluation: **13 USD** (converted from 1,990 円 official store price as of the review date). We surveyed equal-or-better options delivering comparable user functions (stereo 2.0, USB-powered, analog 3.5 mm input) and **no cheaper product with equal-or-better basic performance could be confirmed**. Typical budget alternatives like Amazon Basics USB-powered speakers are cheaper only in function but notably lower in output (2.2 W RMS total) and thus not performance-equivalent. Therefore, **no cheaper equivalent-or-better option exists**, and CP is set to **1.0**. [2][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

FUNLOGY provides a one-year warranty and standard support. The official page outlines purchase support and warranty practices; however, long-term field reliability data remain limited compared to large incumbents. The simple analog/USB-powered design reduces potential failure points versus complex active/DSP systems. [3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product targets basic audibility and convenience for PCs at minimal cost, without making non-scientific claims. While the small-driver/USB-power approach constrains transparency potential, the design direction (simple analog input, minimal features) is coherent for its cost goal and does not rely on occult explanations.

## Advice

If you want the **cheapest path** to improve a laptop’s tinny speakers slightly, this model is a viable low-risk pick at 13 USD. If you need meaningfully higher output or broader features (e.g., USB-C audio, Bluetooth), Creative Pebble V3 is a common step-up with 8 W RMS and BT/USB-C convenience—at a higher typical price. For actual fidelity gains (measurably flatter FR and lower distortion), consider small powered monitors with individual amplification; USB-powered micro-speakers rarely achieve transparency. [1][2]
