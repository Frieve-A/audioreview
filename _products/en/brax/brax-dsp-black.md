## Overview

The BRAX DSP by Audiotec Fischer represents a premium 12-channel digital signal processor designed exclusively for automotive audio applications. Developed over seven years (2011-2018), this German-engineered processor features three Sigma350 64-bit audio DSPs with 3.6 billion MAC operations per second processing power. The unit incorporates state-of-the-art Asahi Kasei "Velvet Sound" converters with 32-bit native resolution and operates at 192kHz sampling rate with audio bandwidth extending to 80kHz. With its modular design concept and sophisticated power management system featuring 55 voltage regulators, the BRAX DSP positions itself as the ultimate automotive DSP solution.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The BRAX DSP achieves exceptional measured performance across all key audio specifications. Frequency response extends from 5Hz to 80,000Hz, significantly exceeding transparent level requirements (20Hz-20kHz ±0.5dB). The signal-to-noise ratio of 122dB places it among the world's best measured performance in this category, well above the 105dB transparent threshold. Total harmonic distortion measures just 0.0004% (0.00004%), substantially better than the 0.01% transparent level criterion. The native 192kHz/32-bit processing provides superior digital resolution compared to standard transparent requirements. Field testing confirms stable operation with "dead silent" EQs and no ripple artifacts even with high-Q filters, measured at 7.79Vrms output capability [1]. All specifications significantly exceed problematic levels and achieve world-class transparent performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The BRAX DSP demonstrates advanced technological implementation with proprietary triple Sigma350 64-bit fixed-point audio DSP architecture delivering 3.6 billion MAC operations per second. The complete in-house design by Audiotec Fischer represents significant R&D investment over seven years of development. Cutting-edge Asahi Kasei "Velvet Sound" converters provide 32-bit native resolution processing. The sophisticated modular architecture with dual extension card slots and complex power supply featuring 55 voltage regulators demonstrates advanced integration capabilities. However, similar multi-DSP architectures have been adopted by other manufacturers since the 2018 release, reducing the competitive technology gap.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The BRAX DSP is priced at 7,000 USD with 12-channel RCA outputs, multiple input options, 192kHz/32-bit processing, advanced time alignment capabilities, and modular expansion. After comprehensive market research, no automotive DSP processor with equivalent or superior measured performance (12-channel output, 192kHz/32-bit processing, S/N ratio ≥122dB, THD+N ≤0.0004%) is available at a lower price. The BRAX DSP represents the world's cheapest option for this level of performance, resulting in CP=1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

BRAX provides standard 24-month warranty coverage for consumer use with global support through authorized dealers. The robust German engineering features premium component selection with hand-selected parts and strict quality control processes. The complex but well-designed power supply with 55 voltage regulators indicates attention to stability and reliability. Audiotec Fischer maintains an established reputation in high-end car audio with positive user testimonials regarding build quality and performance. Support is available through email (brax@audiotec-fischer.com) with headquarters located in Germany. Limited public failure rate data is available, but user reports suggest good build quality.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

BRAX employs a measurement-focused development approach with transparent specification disclosure and emphasis on quantifiable performance metrics. The DSP represents clear advancement over previous generation processors with higher sampling rates and processing power. However, the majority of the 7,000 USD cost appears unrelated to measurable performance improvement over 1,800 USD alternatives. The premium pricing strategy appears marketing-driven rather than performance-justified, with no evidence of active cost reduction efforts despite achieving similar performance metrics as competitors. The excessive 4x cost premium over equivalent-performing alternatives cannot be rationalized through functional or performance advantages.

## Advice

The BRAX DSP delivers world-class measured performance that meets or exceeds the most demanding automotive audio applications. Its exceptional specifications make it technically suitable for audiophile installations requiring maximum fidelity. As the world's cheapest automotive DSP with this level of measured performance, the BRAX DSP offers excellent cost-performance value. The product is recommended for users requiring the highest possible audio fidelity in automotive applications, as no alternative provides equivalent performance at a lower price point.
