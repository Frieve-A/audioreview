## Overview

The Astrotec Archimedes ATS-01 is a hybrid in-ear monitor featuring a unique combination of a 14.8 mm planar magnetic driver and a 9-layer PZT (piezoelectric) ceramic driver. Priced at 129 USD, it represents Astrotec's attempt to bring innovative dual-driver technology to the competitive mid-range IEM market. The product features CNC-machined stainless steel construction and detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cables, targeting listeners who prefer a neutral-to-bright sound signature.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Public third-party measurements for the Archimedes ATS-01 are limited. Following our 0.5 baseline when measurement coverage is incomplete, we adjust to 0.4 based on available evidence. A published frequency-response example shows a narrow elevation around ~2 kHz (linked to shoutiness), a pronounced notch near ~9 kHz (reducing air/clarity), and additional lift above 10 kHz (adding brittleness). No credible THD/IMD/CSD datasets are available for this model. Electrical specs (106 dB SPL/mW, 16 Ω; stated 5–25 kHz) are documented but do not establish transparent performance by themselves. Overall, insufficient validated measurements plus the observed FR profile justify 0.4.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The hybrid planar-piezo configuration is moderately advanced. The 14.8 mm planar magnetic driver uses a ~2 μm diaphragm with a symmetrical magnetic array (14 magnets each side), and the 9-layer piezoelectric ceramic plate aims to extend upper-treble response. CNC-machined stainless steel housings and modular cabling reflect sound manufacturing. However, neither the planar unit nor the PZT addition is industry-leading in 2025, and similar 14.8 mm planar units are now common. Net technical sophistication is solid but not cutting-edge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Using the lowest-cost product that **matches or exceeds functionality and measured performance** as baseline, Moondrop **Chu II** (official list 22.99 USD, detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin) offers closer adherence to common preference targets with low distortion from independent measurements. Against the 129 USD Archimedes, relative value is about **0.18× vs the baseline**, and no verified measurement advantage is established here. As such, value is poor at MSRP, warranting 0.2.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Astrotec lists warranty coverage for headphones/earphones as **one (1) / two (2) years**, with the **packaging instructions as the standard**. Build quality is above average (CNC-machined metal shell), and the 0.78 mm 2-pin interface supports easy cable replacement. While long-term parts availability is less certain than with major brands, materials and construction support an above-average outlook.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The pursuit of a planar-plus-PZT topology is interesting and shows engineering ambition, but execution appears to prioritize novelty over transparent reproduction. The observed FR traits work against neutral presentation, and simpler single-driver designs often achieve better-validated results. The design direction is thoughtful yet not convincingly justified by measured outcomes at this price.

## Advice

For transparent, low-distortion listening on a tight budget, the Moondrop Chu II delivers superior value and a more target-aligned tonality. If you specifically want planar implementations with stronger track records, options like 7Hz Timeless or DUNU Talos merit consideration (at higher prices). The Archimedes may appeal to collectors interested in hybrid driver experiments, but it represents poor value for general music listening.
