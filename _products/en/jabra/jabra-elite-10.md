## Overview

The Jabra Elite 10 is a true wireless earphone developed by Danish company Jabra. It features 10mm drivers and is characterized by the world's first LE Audio-compatible smart case. It incorporates active noise cancellation functionality and Dolby Audio-compatible spatial audio technology. With IP57 water and dust resistance performance, it achieves up to 36 hours of playback time (including case). However, since Jabra announced its withdrawal from the consumer earphone business in 2024, this product is currently in the inventory disposal phase.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The frequency response covers 20Hz-20kHz, with sufficient sound output capability from the 10mm drivers. While active noise cancellation functionality is implemented, specific noise reduction levels and measurement data are not published. Although spatial audio effects are achieved through Dolby Audio compatibility, achievement of transparency levels (THD below 0.01%, SNR above 105dB) cannot be confirmed. With insufficient objective performance data from measurements, scientific validity evaluation is limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption of 10mm drivers and implementation of the world's first LE Audio-compatible smart case demonstrates technical uniqueness. The smart case supporting both USB-C/3.5mm represents practical technical innovation. Modern features such as Bluetooth 5.3 support, multipoint connection, and HearThrough function are appropriately implemented. However, basic acoustic technology remains at industry standard levels and lacks innovation compared to cutting-edge digital technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Elite 10 Gen 2 is priced at 28,500 yen. Compared to the equivalent performance Soundcore Liberty 4 NC (10,999 yen, 20Hz-20kHz support, active noise cancellation, multipoint connection, IPX4 water resistance), CP = 10,999 yen รท 28,500 yen = 0.39. Despite equivalent functionality, the pricing is approximately 2.6 times higher, significantly inferior from a pure performance-to-price perspective. Even with inventory disposal pricing due to business withdrawal, no performance advantages can be recognized to justify this price difference.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The long-term quality control system as part of Jabra's GN Group is established, providing a 2-year product warranty. Support systems are also established within Japan. However, the business withdrawal decision in 2024 creates a situation where future repair support and successor product development become difficult. While support continues during the current inventory disposal period, significant concerns remain regarding reliability for long-term use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The USB-C/3.5mm dual-compatible design of the LE Audio-compatible smart case represents a rational approach emphasizing practicality. The adoption of 10mm drivers and implementation of IP57 water resistance are appropriate. Active noise cancellation and Dolby Audio compatibility are also reasonably implemented as standard features. However, the lack of competitiveness underlying the business withdrawal reveals fundamental limitations in design philosophy. Insufficient response to cost reduction through cutting-edge digital technology utilization made sustainable product development difficult.

## Advice

Purchasing the Jabra Elite 10 is not recommended considering the risk of future support termination due to business withdrawal. While temporary price advantages exist due to current inventory disposal, significant risks accompany long-term use and repair support perspectives. Equivalent functional products like the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC are available at approximately one-third the price as continuing development products, making it an unreasonable choice. Particularly with no clear performance advantages confirmed in measured performance, there are no reasons to justify the price difference. The optimal choice for consumers is purchasing equivalent functional products with continued support.
