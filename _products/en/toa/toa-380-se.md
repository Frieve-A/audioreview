## Overview

TOA Corporation, established in 1934 as a specialist manufacturer of commercial and professional sound equipment, developed the 380-SE as a 3-way loudspeaker system specifically for electronic music reproduction during the 1980s. Now discontinued, the system featured a bass reflex enclosure housing a 15-inch woofer, compression driver with constant directivity horn, and exponential horn tweeter. With original MSRP of 1,100 USD each in the 1980s, this vintage professional speaker represents TOA's conventional approach to sound reinforcement applications from an earlier era, available today only on used markets.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

When credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack comprehensive audio-quality-relevant measurement data, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 as per evaluation framework. The 380-SE provides basic specifications including 120W RMS power handling (50Hz-20kHz), 360W program capacity, 8-ohm impedance, and 102 dB sensitivity. However, critical performance metrics including THD, S/N ratio, frequency response deviation range, and dynamic range measurements are not available for evaluation. The constant directivity horn provides controlled 90° horizontal by 40° vertical dispersion pattern, though precise performance characteristics cannot be verified without independent measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The 380-SE employs conventional 1980s-era loudspeaker technology with basic 3-way passive design. While appearing to utilize TOA's proprietary constant directivity horn implementation, the system relies entirely on mature analog/mechanical technologies without integration of digital processing, software components, or contemporary innovations. The bass reflex enclosure design and compression driver configuration represent standard professional audio approaches that offer no significant competitive advantage over current alternatives. Though demonstrating in-house design capabilities, the technology level reflects outdated methodologies easily replicated by competitors without meaningful technical differentiation for modern applications.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values. Current used market price: 600 USD (pair). The TOA 380-SE provides 120W RMS power handling, 360W program capacity, 8-ohm impedance, 102 dB sensitivity, and constant directivity horn (90°×40°) functionality and measured performance. Current professional speakers with equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance include the Behringer B215XL (approximately 600 USD/pair). The B215XL provides 15-inch woofer, 250W RMS power handling, and 96dB sensitivity, offering equivalent basic performance to the TOA 380-SE. CP = 600 USD ÷ 600 USD = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

TOA provides 5-year warranty coverage for audio products, exceeding industry standard warranty periods. The passive loudspeaker design inherently offers high reliability through simple construction with minimal failure-prone components compared to active systems. TOA maintains global support infrastructure established through 90 years of operation since 1934, providing professional-grade service capabilities. However, historical reliability concerns include a 2010 recall affecting SC series speakers due to mounting bracket failures, though no specific issues are documented for the 380-SE model. The company's long operational history and commercial focus support reasonable long-term serviceability expectations for this vintage product.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The 380-SE reflects TOA's rational approach to professional audio design for its era, utilizing proven acoustic principles including bass reflex loading and horn dispersion control without occult audio claims. The straightforward 3-way passive configuration employs conventional materials and construction methods appropriate for commercial applications. The design philosophy demonstrates rationality through scientific engineering principles, avoiding subjective audio myths while focusing on measurable parameters such as controlled directivity patterns, power handling, and sensitivity optimization. For 1980s technology, the constant directivity horn implementation and professional-grade construction represent sound engineering decisions based on acoustic science rather than marketing-driven features. The design approach prioritized functional requirements for professional electronic music reproduction, demonstrating rational cost-effectiveness for its intended application.

## Advice

For users seeking vintage professional audio equipment, the TOA 380-SE represents a specialized piece designed for electronic music reproduction in professional settings. Available only on used markets at approximately 800 USD, purchasers should expect 1980s-era performance characteristics, limited technical documentation, and no warranty coverage. While the constant directivity horn and professional construction were appropriate for their era, modern professional monitors offer superior measured performance, comprehensive specifications, and current support. Collectors and users specifically requiring period-correct equipment for vintage setups may find value in the 380-SE's original design purpose, but most professional applications would benefit from contemporary alternatives offering better measured performance and support infrastructure.
