## Overview

The TOA ES-0871 was a professional 2-way speaker system manufactured by TOA Corporation. It handled 600W of continuous program power and featured a 38cm cone woofer and a CD horn to achieve a frequency response of 70-20,000Hz. Its 90-degree wedge shape facilitated easy wall and ceiling mounting, making it suitable for both portable and permanent installations. Production ceased on January 20, 2021, and the speaker is now only available on the used market. TOA is a long-established Japanese audio equipment manufacturer with a solid reputation for public address systems in schools and public facilities.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The published measurement data for the ES-0871 is limited and insufficient for evaluation against modern transparency-level standards. While the specifications list a frequency response of 70-20,000Hz and a sound pressure level of 100dB (1W, 1m), crucial data on distortion characteristics such as THD (Total Harmonic Distortion), S/N ratio, crosstalk, and dynamic range are not provided. For instance, speaker evaluation criteria consider a THD of 1% or higher as problematic, but it is unknown if this unit meets that standard. This makes it impossible to objectively assess its scientific sound quality improvement effects. The crossover frequency of 1,800Hz is conventional, but without substantiation from high-precision measurement data, the achievement of transparency-level sound quality cannot be verified.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ES-0871 employs a conventional 2-way passive speaker design with limited technological innovation. The combination of a 38cm woofer and a CD horn is a standard industry approach, and the 1,800Hz crossover frequency is a common setting. While the practical consideration of a 90-degree wedge shape for installation is useful, there are no unique technological breakthroughs that significantly enhance acoustic performance. It lacks modern features such as advanced DSP, active crossovers, advanced driver technology, or room correction functions. Even considering its design era, the technology level is below the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The ES-0871 was discontinued in 2021 and is traded on the used market for around 30,000 JPY. A current product with equivalent functionality and performance, the JBL JRX215, is available new for 23,980 JPY (as of July 2025). The JRX215 is also a 15-inch 2-way passive speaker with comparable power handling (250W continuous, 1000W peak), a frequency response of 41Hz-18kHz, and comes with a modern design and a new product warranty. The cost-performance is rated at approximately 0.8, based on the calculation: 23,980 JPY รท 30,000 JPY = 0.799. It is more rational to choose a new, warrantied product than to pay 30,000 JPY for a used, technically obsolete item with no support.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This product, discontinued on January 20, 2021, raises significant concerns regarding reliability and support. TOA's official policy states that repairs for discontinued products are available "during the minimum retention period for repair parts (a guideline of 7 years after discontinuation)," but service ends once parts are out of stock. When purchased used, there is no manufacturer warranty, and repairs are highly uncertain, depending entirely on parts availability. If a dedicated component like a driver unit or the internal network fails, the speaker may become irreparable, or the repair cost could exceed the product's value. The multi-year warranty and stable support system that accompany current products are absent here.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design philosophy of the ES-0871 is rational in meeting the basic requirements for a professional speaker, but it does not incorporate advanced approaches to sound quality improvement. Practical considerations like a simple 2-way passive design and an installation-friendly wedge shape are evident. However, this remains within a conservative design framework. It lacks modern scientific approaches such as optimization based on detailed measurement data or correction functions using DSP technology. While there are no occult claims, there is also no evidence of an active pursuit of transparency-level sound quality. Consequently, it becomes a product that can be substituted by less expensive general-purpose equipment, diminishing its significance as a dedicated device.

## Advice

Purchasing the TOA ES-0871 is not recommended. As a discontinued product, it is only available used, and it is difficult to justify its market price of around 30,000 JPY. For approximately 24,000 JPY, you can buy a new JBL JRX215, which offers equivalent performance, a manufacturer's warranty, and ongoing support. For professional use, equipment reliability and prompt service are critical, making the acquisition of a product with limited support too risky. While the ES-0871 may have historical value, for practical audio applications, choosing a more affordable and reliable current product is the wiser decision.
