## Overview

The Steinberg UR-RT4 is a 6-input, 4-output USB 2.0 audio interface featuring four Rupert Neve Designs transformers. Combined with Yamaha's D-PRE preamps, it supports 24-bit/192kHz with external power for stable operation. It includes zero-latency monitoring and Cubase AI software bundle, providing essential recording setup elements.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Basic measurements are good, with AK5359 ADC achieving 102dB S/N ratio and THD+N around 0.0008%, offering near-transparent resolution. D-PRE preamps provide low-noise amplification with frequency response within 20Hz-20kHz ±0.5dB. However, Rupert Neve transformers add intentional harmonic distortion (2nd/3rd harmonics) for character change, not fidelity. Measured audible improvements are limited, with reviews noting undetectable on/off differences in ABX-like tests. Per criteria, S/N below 105dB warrants intermediate score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Yamaha's D-PRE preamps feature highly regarded low-noise design, and Rupert Neve collaboration transformers show advanced analog circuitry. SSP2 DSP enables stable zero-latency monitoring, with AK5359 ADC and USB 2.0 implementation at high completion levels. The 6-input setup differentiates, though transformer direction is debatable.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At 649 USD, compared to equivalent 6-input performance (S/N over 100dB, THD+N under 0.001%) in Native Instruments Komplete Audio 6 MkII at 179 USD, CP value is 179÷649=0.28 (rounded to 0.3). MOTU M6 (399 USD) also matches. High cost from transformers lacks verified benefits, with alternatives achieving same quality cheaper.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Steinberg maintains established audio industry presence with stable drivers and updates. External power ensures reliability for long-term use. Some DSP limitations noted, but warranty and support meet standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

D-PRE adoption and zero-latency monitoring are practical, but transformer distortion addition lacks scientific basis for transparent interfaces, driving up cost. Emphasizing analog over digital transparency is not contemporary, with limited rationale given alternatives.

## Advice

Consider UR-RT4 only if transformer changes are verifiably needed. Equivalent performance is available cheaper via Native Instruments Komplete Audio 6 MkII (179 USD) or MOTU M6 (399 USD), with no practical drawbacks. 649 USD justifies only with confirmed scientific effects. For most, undetectable differences make software-processed transparent recording more rational. Prioritize measurements for alternatives.
