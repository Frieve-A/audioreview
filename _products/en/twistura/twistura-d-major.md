rating: [2.6, 0.4, 0.6, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7]
price: 50
summary: "Solid metal build with a dual-chamber design and swappable nozzles; however, the stated THD ≤1% and limited third-party data keep objective performance average. Warranty is standard—overall a competent but not standout entry-level pick."

## Overview

TWISTURA is a new entrant to the audio market. The D-Major is a 10 mm dual-chamber, dual-magnetic single-DD IEM with a beryllium-plated composite diaphragm and a detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, selling around 50 USD. The company highlights a magnetic flux up to 1 Tesla and provides tuning accessories/nozzles and a metal build [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Published specs list **THD ≤ 1% @1 kHz**, **108 dB** sensitivity (@1 kHz), **22 Ω** impedance, and a **15 Hz–37 kHz** response (effective 20 Hz–20 kHz). The distortion figure is relatively high for modern IEMs and independent, full-suite third-party measurements are scarce at this time. Using the 0.5 midpoint as a baseline when data are incomplete and adjusting downward for the stated distortion, we set 0.4 [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The dual-chamber/dual-magnet architecture, beryllium-plated diaphragm, and the claimed 1 Tesla flux indicate thoughtful engineering. Swappable nozzles add user-tunable response. However, absent public evidence that it surpasses state-of-the-art peers, this remains solid but not groundbreaking implementation [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Comparator (equal-or-better in functions & performance):**  
**Moondrop CHU II** — detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, 10 mm DD, manufacturer-stated **THD ≤ 0.5% @1 kHz, 94 dB** and **119 dB/Vrms** sensitivity; independent measurements also show low distortion and well-controlled response [2][3].  
**Prices used:** D-Major **50 USD** (street) [1]; CHU II **19 USD** (street confirmation) [4].

**Computation:** 19 USD ÷ 50 USD = **0.38** → rounds to **0.4**.  
Because a cheaper, equal-or-better option exists, the D-Major’s CP is 0.4 (scores are unified in USD for consistency).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Sold via an authorized distributor with a stated **1-year IEM warranty / 3-month cable warranty**. As a young brand, long-term RMA/MTBF data are not yet established, so we assign a neutral mid score [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product focuses on measurable levers—airflow control, diaphragm rigidity/mass, magnet strength, and user-tunable nozzles—rather than nebulous claims. It’s a rational direction, though current public data do not show transparency-level performance across key metrics [1].

## Advice

If your priority is **objective value**, start with **Moondrop CHU II**: it is cheaper while meeting or exceeding the user-facing functions and key specs [2][3][4]. If you value the D-Major’s aesthetic, nozzle-based tuning, or simply prefer its fit, it can still be a reasonable pick. Willing to spend slightly more? The **TRUTHEAR ZERO** line remains a sensible alternative to consider in this bracket [5].
