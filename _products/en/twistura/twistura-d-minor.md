## Overview

The Twistura D-Minor is a budget-oriented in-ear monitor featuring a 10 mm dual-magnetic dynamic driver with LCP diaphragm material. It targets entry-level buyers, includes interchangeable tuning filters (three nozzles), and ships with a USB-C DAC-enabled adapter cable for devices without a headphone jack.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer-reported specs list 30 Ω ± 3 impedance, 108 dB/Vrms sensitivity (1 kHz), and a 15 Hz–37 kHz frequency response; the bundle includes a USB-C DAC adapter rated up to 32-bit/384 kHz [3]. Retailer listings also state THD@1 kHz ≤ 1 % (conditions not fully specified) [5]. Third-party measurements show a notable bass elevation extending into lower mids and measurable differences among the three filters, but comprehensive public data (full FR deviation vs target, THD/IMD sweeps, isolation, unit variance) remain limited [1]. Given modest, partly unspecified metrics and tuning that prioritizes upper-mid presence, audible transparency is likely average for the class.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design uses common contemporary approaches: an LCP-dome dynamic driver with a dual-magnetic circuit, zinc-alloy front chamber plus 3D-resin shell, and a basic interchangeable-filter system. The included USB-C DAC adapter offers mainstream entry-level capability (up to 32-bit/384 kHz) without notable technical advancements versus typical dongles [3][4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price: 30 USD (D-Minor) [3].  
Cheapest equal-or-better alternative (normalized for functions): **Moondrop Chu II** (official 22.99 USD) + **USB-C to 3.5 mm adapter** (9.00 USD) to match the D-Minor’s included USB-C solution = **31.99 USD** total [2][4].  
**Equivalence note:** Chu II offers comparable user functions (with the adapter) and equal-or-better measured performance axes for IEMs (more neutral FR trend; THD ≤ 0.5 % @ 1 kHz, 94 dB per manufacturer) [2]. Because the cheapest equal-or-better option is **not cheaper** than D-Minor in the U.S. market at review time, the CP score is **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Build and materials are typical for this bracket. Long-term reliability data are scarce for this new brand. Warranty/support presence appears standard for budget imports; service networks and extended coverage are limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A mid-centric, vocal-forward balance with filter-based fine-tuning addresses mainstream listening. Practicality is enhanced by the included USB-C DAC lead for jack-less devices. Claims implying “high-end” performance remain unsubstantiated by independent data; the overall direction is pragmatic rather than innovative.

## Advice

Choose the D-Minor if you want an all-in-one box (IEM + simple USB-C DAC) and basic filter-based voicing options at a low price. If you don’t need the filters or the in-box DAC, **Moondrop Chu II** remains a strong technical baseline; adding a 9 USD adapter yields similar functionality at a total price that is roughly the same or slightly higher than the D-Minor in the U.S.
