summary: "High-voltage portable DAP with twin ES9068AS DACs and A&K’s first 4.4 mm balanced out. Independent lab results show transparent performance; cost-performance is 1.0 because no cheaper DAP matches its ≥12 Vrms capability with comparable measurements."

## Overview

The Astell & Kern Kann Alpha is the third-generation high-output digital audio player in the KANN line. It adds A&K’s first 4.4 mm balanced headphone output and delivers up to 12 Vrms from the balanced jack (no-load). The design targets listeners who need unusually high portable drive voltage for difficult headphones, in a rugged aluminum chassis with A&K’s custom Android-based UI. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent lab measurements confirm transparent performance by conventional thresholds. Hi-Fi News measured: **A-wtd S/N 117.0 dB (re 0 dBFS)**, **THD 0.0002–0.0005 % (re 0 dBV, 20 Hz–20 kHz)**, **frequency response ±0.01 dB (20 Hz–20 kHz)**, **output impedance <1 Ω**, and **maximum power 85 mW/32 Ω (single-ended) at <1 % THD**. Into very low loads it delivered **22 mW/8 Ω at 1 % THD**. These figures meet or exceed transparency targets for portable playback; the single-ended power into 32 Ω is modest, but the high-voltage balanced path remains the differentiator. [2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Twin ES9068AS DACs, micro-relay isolation between 2.5 mm/4.4 mm balanced outputs, and the first 4.4 mm jack in an A&K player show thoughtful execution. However, the platform is based on a customized Android 9-era stack and doesn’t represent a step-change versus recent rivals, so overall technical novelty is moderate. [1][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

To be a valid comparator, a cheaper product must offer **equal-or-better user-visible functions and measured performance**, including **≥12 Vrms balanced drive** and transparent core metrics (S/N, THD, FR). We could not verify any DAP under **1,099 USD** that meets the **≥12 Vrms** requirement. The closest current options that do meet or exceed that voltage—**A&K KANN Cube (1,499 USD)** and **A&K KANN Ultra (commonly 1,759 USD)**—are **more expensive**. Popular alternatives like the **iBasso DX260 (6 Vrms balanced, 1,015 mW/32 Ω; 949 USD)** fail the voltage criterion despite strong specs. Therefore, **no cheaper equivalent exists**, and cost-performance is **set to 1.0**. [1][4][5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Build quality is solid with a milled aluminum chassis. A&K issued firmware updates through **v1.31 (2022-03-22)** adding features like AK File Drop and BT Sink; updates since then appear limited, which owners should note for long-term software support. [7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Alpha prioritizes high portable output voltage and premium construction. For many users, a smartphone plus a competent dongle DAC/amp already achieves transparent playback at far lower cost/size. The Alpha’s approach is rational mainly if you specifically need **very high-voltage** portable drive for high-impedance/full-size headphones and want a single-box solution.

## Advice

Choose the Kann Alpha if you (1) require **≥12 Vrms** on the go for 250–600 Ω dynamics or insensitive planars, and (2) prefer A&K’s integrated player experience. If you don’t need that voltage headroom, options like the iBasso DX260 or a smartphone + dongle will save money and size while remaining audibly transparent; they are not valid CP comparators here only because they lack Alpha-level drive voltage.
