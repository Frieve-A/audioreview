## Overview

Astell & Kern Novus is a collaboration with Empire Ears using a 13-driver quadbrid array—dual W9+ dynamic woofers, five balanced armatures (including four NOVA mids), four electrostatics, and dual bone conductors—with Dual Conduction Architecture (air: 5 Hz–100 kHz / bone: 5 Hz–40 kHz). Official specs list 108.1 dB sensitivity (1 kHz/1 mW), 2 Ω impedance, and a list price of **4,999 USD** [1]. The model is a **limited edition of 600 units** and launched in Japan on September 14, 2024 (5867 USD) [4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specifications are unusually detailed (driver topology, bandwidth, 2 Ω impedance, sensitivity) [1]. Independent lab-grade datasets are scarce; Bloom Audio has published frequency-response captures on an IEC-711 clone coupler (limited reliability above ~10 kHz), which at least supplies third-party FR context [2]. Absent comprehensive third-party data on FR flatness (±dB), harmonic distortion, and isolation, audible transparency cannot be confirmed; the score modestly exceeds the default due to the presence of third-party FR plus complete official specs [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The integration of four transducer types with synX crossover, ARC damping, and premium materials (6061-T6 aluminum with DLC finish, 24 K gold elements, sapphire glass) indicates very high engineering ambition and manufacturing quality [1]. The technology is impressive; whether it yields audibly superior results versus simpler, well-measured references remains unproven in public measurements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Market price (review target): **4,999 USD** [1].

**Comparator (cheapest with equal-or-better user functions and measured performance):**  
**Etymotic ER2SE** — passive, wired universal IEM (functions match Novus); public information shows reference-leaning FR on B&K 5128 and class-leading passive isolation **35–42 dB**; current official price **149.99 USD** [3][5][6]. *Equivalence note:* passive UIEM; FR adherence and isolation are at least as strong as typical high-end benchmarks, with third-party isolation data within the Etymotic line and independent lab usage of the B&K 5128 system [5][6].

**CP calculation (single-product method):**  
149.99 USD ÷ 4,999 USD = 0.03 → 0.0

Given the absence of superior, verifiable measured performance for Novus, the ER2SE establishes a dramatically cheaper path to equal-or-better measured fidelity on core metrics (FR/Isolation), so Novus receives the minimum CP score [2][3][5][6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

There is limited field-failure data. The **2 Ω** load can expose output-impedance interactions in some sources; hiss risk is also typical with high-sensitivity IEMs [1]. The limited run may constrain long-term parts availability. Warranty specifics are not detailed on the official page.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Design emphasizes maximal complexity and luxury materials. Claimed ultrasonic bandwidth and dual conduction exceed human audibility, and public evidence of perceptual gains is lacking. With cheaper, measurement-backed options (e.g., ER2SE) achieving reference-grade FR/Isolation, Novus appears priced for collectability rather than measured fidelity [2][3][5][6].

## Advice

If you value collectability and lavish construction, Novus fits. If your goal is measured fidelity per dollar, first consult independent data and audition. **Etymotic ER2SE (149.99 USD)** represents a proven, substantially cheaper path to reference-grade listening; verify your source’s output impedance given Novus’ **2 Ω** rating [1][3][5][6].
