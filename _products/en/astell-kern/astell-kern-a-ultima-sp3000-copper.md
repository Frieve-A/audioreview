summary: "Flagship DAP with a pure copper chassis and AKM HEXA-Audio architecture. Excellent measured noise performance for IEMs, but pricey versus a smartphone + portable DAC that delivers comparable transparency and broader utility."

## Overview

The Astell & Kern A&ultima SP3000 Copper is a limited-run variant of the SP3000 built with a pure copper body (reported 99.8% purity and protective coating) instead of the standard 904L stainless steel. Internally it uses four AK4499EX DACs plus two AK4191EQ modulators in A&K’s “HEXA-Audio” architecture with fully separated balanced/unbalanced paths. A&K specifies a 130 dB SNR and a Snapdragon 6125 octa-core platform with LDAC/aptX HD support. MSRP is 3,699 USD. [1][2][3][4]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent APx555 measurements show **SNR 125.1 dB** (AES17 dynamic range 123.5 dB) and **idle noise ~3.6 µVrms**, which are excellent figures for IEM use. At an IEM-level **50 mV output the SP3000 yields 83 dB THD+N (SINAD)**; distortion **rises above ~3 kHz and below ~500 Hz** and increases at higher output levels. Crosstalk is exceptionally low (typically **< −140 dB**, ~−125 dB at 20 kHz). The stock AKM reconstruction filters **do not fully attenuate by 22.05 kHz** (common for current AKM/ESS options) and the device is susceptible to intersample overs only at max volume. Overall, noise/linearity are excellent and consistent with transparent playback for sensitive IEMs; power/distortion behavior is the main caveat for demanding full-size headphones. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

A&K’s implementation is notable: **independent dual audio circuits** with **four AK4499EX + two AK4191EQ** to physically separate digital modulation from analog conversion, heavy internal shielding, and an up-to-date Snapdragon 6125 platform with app support (including Roon Ready). Material execution differs on the Copper Edition (pure copper body) while the standard SP3000 uses **904L stainless steel**. The architecture is sophisticated and uncommon among DAPs. [2][3][1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

A **smartphone + portable DAC/amp** can match audible transparency and exceed usability for far less money. A concrete comparator:

- **Google Pixel 8a (unlocked)** — **499 USD** list (US Google Store). [5]  
- **TOPPING G5 portable DAC/amp** — **299 USD** typical retail; manufacturer specs **SNR 124 dB, THD+N <0.00009%** with balanced 4.4 mm out. [6][7]

Total outlay: **~798 USD** versus **3,699 USD** for the SP3000 Copper. Functionally you retain high-res playback, streaming apps, balanced output, and far broader general-purpose utility from the phone. Given measured transparency at the ear with competent DAC/amps, the SP3000 Copper’s price premium is hard to justify outside of its build/collector appeal.

*Japan price note (for readers in JP):* Pixel 8a is **72,600 円** on Google Store JP; TOPPING G5 is commonly **40,000 円** at domestic retailers. USD list prices above are used for the cost comparison. [8][9]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A&K maintains a mature service network and continues firmware updates on flagships, but cadence is slower than mainstream smartphones. Android-based DAPs also age faster on app support. The Copper body’s finish uses protective coatings to curb patina, but copper is more scratch-prone than steel; the hardware itself is robust and finished to a high standard. [3][2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

SP3000 Copper optimizes for luxury materials and complex DAC topology to push noise/jitter performance that is already well below audibility for IEM use. For listeners who value the **object**—craftsmanship, feel, and a self-contained player—the proposition makes sense. For purely audio outcomes and day-to-day use, a phone plus a measured-transparent portable DAC achieves similar results at a fraction of the price.

## Advice

- **IEM-first users** who want a no-compromise standalone player and value copper craftsmanship may love it.  
- **Full-size planar users** should consider the SP3000’s distortion-vs-level behavior and modest power (about **0.2 W @ 32 Ω; 0.15 W @ 300 Ω**) before committing. [1]  
- **Value-focused buyers** should prioritize a modern phone plus a high-performing portable DAC/amp.
