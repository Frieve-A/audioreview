## Overview

The Astell&Kern KANN ULTRA represents the fifth generation in the KANN series, positioning itself as a flagship portable digital audio player. Featuring dual ES9039MPRO DAC chips, an octa-core processor, and up to 16Vrms balanced output capability, the device targets audiophiles seeking high-end portable audio performance. Astell&Kern, established in 2013, has built its reputation on premium DAP development with a focus on "original sound" reproduction. The KANN ULTRA continues this tradition with advanced technical specifications including support for PCM up to 768kHz/32-bit and DSD up to DSD512, housed in a premium aluminum construction with comprehensive connectivity options.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate excellent performance with frequency response of ±0.006dB (20Hz-20kHz), S/N ratio of 115-119dB, and THD of 0.0004% @ 1kHz, all exceeding transparent level criteria. However, credible third-party measurements from Audio Science Review [1] reveal significant implementation issues that substantially impact real-world performance. IMD distortion reaches problematic levels, power output management shows inconsistent behavior across different impedance loads, and the headphone output stage demonstrates poor gain management. While balanced line output performs well with inaudible distortion, the core headphone amplification function exhibits unusual power curves, limited power delivery at 32Ω loads, and jitter performance described as "unsightly, though inaudible." The combination of excellent catalog specifications undermined by measured performance deficiencies places this product between problematic and transparent levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The KANN ULTRA demonstrates advanced technical implementation with dual ES9039MPRO flagship DAC chips representing current industry-leading technology. Astell&Kern's proprietary TERATON ALPHA solution combines patented noise removal, amplification, and interface technologies, showing meaningful technological advancement. The octa-core processor provides contemporary processing power for complex audio operations, while comprehensive format support and advanced connectivity (Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5.3 with aptX-HD/LDAC) demonstrate sophisticated integration. The company's established expertise in premium DAP development since 2013 and continued innovation in proprietary technologies create competitive advantages that would require significant time for new entrants to replicate. However, implementation challenges revealed in third-party measurements prevent recognition of perfect execution despite the advanced underlying technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Current price of review target:** 1759 USD.

**Cheapest equivalent solution (finished-goods, user-focused equivalence):**  
- **Smartphone + Dongle DAC**: *moto g play (2024) unlocked* 109.99 USD + **FiiO KA17** 149.99 USD = **259.98 USD**.  
  **Equivalence note:** KA17 provides 3.5 mm + 4.4 mm outputs, up to 768 kHz/32-bit PCM and DSD512, SNR ≥ 126 dB (A-wtd), THD+N as low as 0.0004 % (balanced), and sufficient output power for typical IEMs/headphones—meeting transparent-class performance. A modern Android phone serves as the player/streamer UI. [2][3][4][5]

**Calculation (single cheapest comparator as required):**  
259.98 USD ÷ 1759 USD = **0.1478 → 0.1** (rounded to one decimal).

Result: A dedicated DAP at 1759 USD is far outperformed on price by a smartphone+dongle stack that delivers equal-or-better user-visible functions (balanced out, hi-res formats, robust output) and transparent-class measurements.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The KANN ULTRA provides only 1-year manufacturer warranty, below the industry standard 2-year coverage. While the aluminum construction offers robust build quality with minimal moving parts, customer support quality presents serious concerns. Multiple documented cases across online forums and review platforms [6] report unresponsive customer service, with users experiencing weeks without replies to warranty inquiries regarding expensive units, and Trustpilot reviews showing a 2.7/5 star rating with 56% being 1-star reviews citing poor customer service. The support infrastructure relies primarily on dealer-based systems rather than direct manufacturer engagement. Repair processes require extended timelines of several weeks with no instant replacement options, as all Astell&Kern products undergo repair evaluation rather than immediate replacement. Despite the company's established track record since 2013, the documented pattern of poor customer service response significantly undermines confidence in post-purchase support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Astell&Kern's design philosophy emphasizes "original sound" reproduction and high-resolution audio technology, incorporating some rational elements like flagship DAC implementation and advanced functional integration appropriate for premium portable applications. The proprietary TERATON ALPHA technology development demonstrates innovation effort, and continued adoption of cutting-edge components shows progressive technology integration. However, the company's emphasis on subjective concepts like "original sound" without clear measurement-driven validation, combined with high pricing that doesn't optimize cost allocation relative to measured performance, reveals mixed rationality. Claims about studio-quality audio and sampling rate benefits lack scientific backing, while the significant cost premium over competitors with superior measured performance suggests inefficient resource allocation toward audible improvements.

## Advice

For potential purchasers seeking premium portable audio, consider that the KANN ULTRA's advanced technology and premium construction are undermined by implementation issues and poor customer support. At 1759 USD, the KANN ULTRA is far outperformed on price by a smartphone+dongle combination (259.98 USD) that delivers equal-or-better user-visible functions and transparent-class measurements. However, the documented customer service issues pose significant risk for warranty claims or technical support needs. Audiophiles prioritizing measured performance should note that the performance compromises revealed in third-party measurements combined with the extreme cost premium over general-purpose alternatives make the KANN ULTRA difficult to justify on pure performance grounds. The KANN ULTRA may appeal to users specifically committed to Astell&Kern's ecosystem, but the combination of implementation issues, poor customer support, and poor cost-performance suggests careful consideration of alternatives with better measured performance and more responsive support systems.
