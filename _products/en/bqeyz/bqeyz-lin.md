## Overview

BQEYZ Lin is a USB-C DAC/amplifier adapter. It uses the Conexant CX31993 chip, supports up to 32bit/384kHz PCM, and provides 3.5mm and 4.4mm output jacks. Developed by BQEYZ as a portable audio product for smartphones and PCs with a compact, lightweight design.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Device-level measured values such as THD+N and SNR for this specific product could not be verified from primary sources. While the use of CX31993 and support for up to 32bit/384kHz, 3.5mm/4.4mm outputs are listed on retailer pages, quantitative sound quality indicators are not sufficiently substantiated. Per policy, we set a conservative 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Adopting the CX31993 chip, supporting up to 32bit/384kHz, and providing 3.5mm/4.4mm outputs is practical for a budget dongle. A 4.4mm jack does not by itself guarantee a fully balanced circuit implementation. Overall feature set is slightly above average for the price segment.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At a price of 16 USD, comparison is needed with the lowest-priced DAC products having 4.4mm balanced output. The Apple USB-C adapter (approximately 9 USD) only provides 3.5mm output without balanced output support, making it functionally non-equivalent [2]. Among 4.4mm balanced-capable products, this product positions in the lowest price range, resulting in a CP evaluation of 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

BQEYZ is an established audio brand with limited global reach. Warranty and after-sales support appear average; long-term repair options and parts availability are unclear.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design focuses on portability and compatibility to complement smartphone/PC audio, which is a reasonable goal. However, the lack of device-level measurements and unclear balance topology preclude a higher score.

## Advice

This is a practical entry option for those seeking an affordable USB-C dongle, especially if a 4.4mm jack is desired. If objective performance is critical, consider models with published device-level measurements and clear circuit disclosures.
