## Overview

The BQEYZ Winter Ultra is a hybrid IEM combining a 12mm PAR diaphragm dual-cavity dynamic driver with an 11.6mm PZT bone conduction driver. Released exclusively through Angelears Store in Q1 2023, it is positioned as an improved version of the original Winter model. The device features a CNC-machined aluminum shell and high-purity single-crystal copper silver-plated cable with interchangeable 3.5mm/4.4mm plugs. Priced at approximately 270-280 USD (around 40,000 yen), it targets the mid-tier market segment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The basic specifications of 38Ω impedance, 113dB sensitivity, and 5Hz-40kHz frequency response represent standard levels. However, detailed measurement data for THD, SNR, crosstalk, and other critical parameters remain unpublished, making objective evaluation of transparency level achievement difficult. Without confirmation of compliance with measurement baseline standards for transparency, the scientific validity receives an average rating. The bone conduction driver's contribution to sound quality improvement lacks scientific backing with insufficient measurement data, suggesting limited audible improvements. Until comprehensive third-party measurement data becomes available, the scientific validity of this product remains unclear.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The combination of a 12mm dual-cavity dynamic driver with PAR (polyarylate) diaphragm and an 11.6mm PZT bone conduction driver represents development beyond conventional single-driver configurations. Attention to detail is evident in the 0.25mm precision gap design between the magnet and U-bracket. The adoption of CNC-machined aluminum shells and high-quality cables contributes to physical quality improvements. However, questions remain regarding the acoustic engineering necessity of bone conduction technology, as superior dynamic or balanced armature drivers might achieve greater efficiency. While demonstrating certain technical ingenuity, the approach cannot be considered revolutionary.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Against the Winter Ultra's 270-280 USD price point, competing products offering equivalent or superior performance are available at significantly lower costs. Notably, the Simgot EM6L (109 USD) provides equivalent or better performance for less than half the price. Calculation: 109 USD ÷ 270 USD ≈ 0.40, resulting in a score of 0.4. Other alternatives like the Truthear Nova (150 USD) and the Binary Acoustics × Gizaudio Chopin (200 USD) also offer better value, raising questions about the Winter Ultra's pricing justification. Even considering the added value of bone conduction technology, no decisive performance advantage justifies this price differential.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

BQEYZ, established in 2016 as a Chinese audio manufacturer, has built a certain track record with market recognition through its Spring, Summer, and Autumn series products. However, compared to established companies like Sennheiser and Shure, its history remains relatively short with limited long-term reliability data. Public information regarding warranty periods and specific RMA ratios is insufficient, making objective failure rate assessment difficult. As the Winter Ultra is a limited edition model, future parts supply and support continuity remain uncertain. While no major quality issues have been reported currently, an industry-average assessment is appropriate.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The bone conduction driver integration approach lacks a clear theoretical basis and scientific rationality. In conventional acoustic reproduction, bone conduction serves an auxiliary role and is inefficient as a primary means for high-quality sound reproduction. Investing the same cost and development resources in optimizing superior dynamic or balanced armature drivers would likely yield greater improvements both measurably and audibly. While the PAR diaphragm and dual-cavity design represent rational improvements, bone conduction technology adoption introduces irrational elements into the overall design philosophy. Pursuing technical complexity that doesn't contribute to transparency-level sound quality represents a fundamentally problematic design thinking. With numerous products in the same price range taking more scientifically-grounded approaches, the Winter Ultra's design philosophy clearly lacks rationality.

## Advice

The BQEYZ Winter Ultra attempts differentiation through its hybrid configuration, but at approximately 270-280 USD, it represents a difficult recommendation. Equivalent or superior sound quality is achievable with the Simgot EM6L (approximately 109 USD) or Truthear Nova (approximately 150 USD), making these far more rational choices. The EM6L, in particular, offers comparable performance at less than half the Winter Ultra's price, making it the best choice for those prioritizing cost-performance. The product becomes a consideration only for those specifically attracted to bone conduction technology with flexible budgets, though its objective sound quality improvement remains limited. IEM beginners should strongly consider establishing benchmarks with the mentioned competing products before contemplating upgrades.
