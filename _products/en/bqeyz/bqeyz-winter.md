## Overview

The BQEYZ Winter is a hybrid in-ear monitor that combines a 12mm dynamic driver with an 11.6mm PZT bone conduction unit. Part of BQEYZ's seasonal series developed by the Chinese company, it adopts a unique approach of utilizing bone conduction technology to complement high-frequency reproduction. The product features precision-machined housing from German 5-axis CNC aluminum alloy and comes standard with a 4-core silver-plated single-crystal copper cable, supporting 3.5mm, 2.5mm, and 4.4mm plugs. With specifications of 38Ω impedance, 113dB sensitivity, and 5Hz-40kHz frequency response, it ensures compatibility with a wide range of audio equipment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The measurement performance of the BQEYZ Winter is difficult to evaluate objectively due to limited publicly available information. While the frequency response covers a wide range of 5Hz-40kHz, and its 38Ω impedance and 113dB sensitivity suggest good drivability, crucial measurement data such as THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for assessing audio fidelity have not been disclosed. The high-frequency complementation by the bone conduction driver is theoretically effective, but its actual contribution to performance improvement in terms of measured values is unknown. It is not possible to determine if it achieves the transparency level defined in measurement standards (e.g., SNR 105dB+, THD 0.01% or lower), forcing an evaluation of its scientific validity as being at an average level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The combination of bone conduction technology with dynamic drivers represents a unique approach in IEM design. The in-house development of the 11.6mm PZT bone conduction unit is particularly noteworthy as a technical achievement. The precision of the aluminum housing through 5-axis CNC machining also demonstrates a certain level of technical capability. However, bone conduction technology itself lacks novelty in the audio field, and other manufacturing technologies (driver design, acoustic design, etc.) remain at industry-standard approaches. As its contribution to measurement performance is unclear, the return on technical investment for sound quality improvement may be limited. Compared to current cutting-edge technology, this design focuses more on differentiation through combining existing technologies rather than innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The BQEYZ Winter's Japanese market price is 33,370 JPY, but products with potentially equivalent or superior measurement performance exist, such as the KZ ZS10 Pro (5,899 JPY) and Moondrop Aria (9,980 JPY). While these products lack bone conduction functionality, they may offer similar results in basic sound quality performance (e.g., frequency response flatness, low distortion) for a much smaller investment. In a cost-performance calculation using the KZ ZS10 Pro as the cheapest alternative, the formula is 5,899 JPY ÷ 33,370 JPY = 0.177, which rounds to a score of 0.2. Even considering the added value of the bone conduction feature, the investment efficiency for sound quality improvement is remarkably low, and its price competitiveness is limited.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

BQEYZ, as a Chinese audio manufacturer, continuously develops multiple product lines, ensuring stable product supply. The aluminum alloy housing offers high durability, and the detachable cable design allows for replacement and repair. Available worldwide through international sales networks, it can be purchased in Japan through major sales channels like Amazon. However, official Japanese-language support is limited, and warranty periods and after-sales service details depend on retailers. While the product's physical quality is good, and firmware updates are unnecessary for this product category, no major long-term usage issues are anticipated. It is evaluated as providing reliability above the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The BQEYZ Winter's design philosophy is based on scientific grounds and is highly commendable. The approach of utilizing bone conduction technology for high-frequency complementation presents a rational solution different from traditional multi-driver designs. The development stance that aims for measurable physical characteristic improvements while eliminating unscientific claims and unfounded occult elements is appropriate. The division of roles between dynamic drivers for low and mid frequencies and bone conduction for high frequencies is a logical design that leverages each driver's characteristics. However, there is room for improvement regarding its necessity as dedicated audio equipment, given the potentially limited performance difference compared to general-purpose devices. Overall, the direction toward improving measurement results and achieving transparency-level sound quality is extremely rational.

## Advice

The BQEYZ Winter is a choice for enthusiasts interested in bone conduction technology and seeking unique products. However, if prioritizing pure sound quality performance and price balance, we recommend considering alternative products like the KZ ZS10 Pro (5,899 JPY) or Moondrop Aria (9,980 JPY). These may provide equivalent or superior basic performance at less than one-fifth of the cost. With a budget of 33,370 JPY, products achieving a higher standard of sound quality, such as the Moondrop Blessing 3 (available on the used market from around 36,200 JPY), should also be considered. The sound quality improvement from bone conduction technology may be limited based on available information, and careful judgment is needed. Comparative listening with competing products is strongly recommended before purchase.
