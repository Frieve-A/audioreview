## Overview

The Simgot ET142 is Simgot Audio’s first planar magnetic in-ear monitor, combining a 12.5 mm planar magnetic driver with a multilayer piezoelectric ceramic (PZT) tweeter in a compact hybrid design. Available since early 2025 with a current market price of 224.99 USD [1], it ships with four interchangeable tuning nozzles and Simgot’s LC7 732-core mixed OFC/silver-plated Litz cable featuring interchangeable 3.5 mm SE and 4.4 mm balanced plugs [1]. The planar unit is described as a dual-symmetric magnetic construction, and the stock tuning targets the SIMGOT-Golden 2023 response [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications list frequency response 8 Hz–40 kHz, impedance 14 Ω ± 15% (@1 kHz), and sensitivity 118 dB/Vrms (@1 kHz) [1]. Third-party reporting indicates passive isolation around 10–15 dB depending on fit [4]. As of August 25, 2025, no standardized lab datasets (e.g., 43AG/5128 THD sweeps with conditions disclosed) are broadly available; therefore, evaluation remains provisional and anchored to official specs clearly labeled as such [1]. The multiple swappable nozzles are a verifiable acoustic mechanism, but without controlled FR/THD deltas published, audible benefit magnitude cannot be quantified beyond qualitative reports [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The ET142 implements a dual-symmetric magnetic planar driver paired with a multilayer PZT tweeter and a four-nozzle architecture (Blazed Titanium, Gold-Plated Copper, Stainless-Steel Red-Circle, Stainless-Steel Black-Circle) for mechanical/acoustic tuning [1]. The included LC7 732-core mixed OFC/silver-plated Litz cable with interchangeable 3.5 mm/4.4 mm plugs and 0.78 mm 2-pin connectors reflects current best practice for modularity and low-resistance wiring [1]. Relative to prior Simgot hybrids, this is a modern, well-integrated implementation, though not a category-defining breakthrough.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **Hidizs MS3** (three screw-in tuning filters) **+ DUNU Lyre Mini** cable (Q-Lock Mini with both 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm plugs included). Current prices: **MS3 = 119.00 USD**, **Lyre Mini = 29.99 USD**, combined **148.99 USD** [2][3].  
**Calculation (USD):** **148.99 USD ÷ 224.99 USD = 0.662… → 0.7** (rounded to one decimal).  
**Equivalence note (provisional):** Hardware tuning via physical filters/nozzles present; both SE and balanced connectivity fulfilled in-box (ET142) or with the minimum accessory bundle (MS3+Lyre Mini); no credible evidence of inferior basic measured performance within audibility-relevant specs in available catalog/limited third-party information [1][2][3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The metal housings and robust LC7 cable suggest adequate durability. Linsoul lists a 1-year warranty for IEMs (cable 3 months) [1]. Long-term failure-rate data specific to ET142 are not yet available given its 2025 release window. The nozzle system introduces extra mechanical interfaces but uses standard materials and rings [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design emphasizes measurable mechanisms (planar + PZT division of labor, nozzle-based acoustic adjustment) and targets a published in-house response curve (SIMGOT-Golden 2023), avoiding non-falsifiable claims [1]. Absent independent lab verification of transparency-level distortion/FR, the approach is rational but not yet confirmed to deliver fully transparent results.

## Advice

ET142 suits listeners who want a planar-based IEM with verified, hardware-level tuning options around 225 USD. The nozzle kit enables meaningful tonality shifts without software EQ [1]. If you specifically need a tunable IEM with both 3.5 mm/4.4 mm connectivity at the lowest possible cost, the **MS3 + Lyre Mini** combo achieves equivalent user-facing functionality at a lower price [2][3]. Check source pairing: at 14 Ω and 118 dB/Vrms, most low-noise sources will drive ET142 comfortably [1].
