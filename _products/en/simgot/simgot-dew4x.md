## Overview

The Simgot DEW4X is a portable USB DAC/amplifier dongle utilizing dual Cirrus Logic CS43198 DAC chips. Priced at 79 USD, this compact device supports high-resolution audio up to 384kHz/32-bit PCM and native DSD256, offering both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs. The DEW4X features aircraft-grade aluminum construction with CNC machining and measures 41.7 x 24.2 x 12.0mm while weighing 24g. Simgot, established in 2013 with engineering roots dating to 1985, focuses on measurement-based audio product development emphasizing technical performance over subjective appeal.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate excellent measured performance across all key indicators [3]. Signal-to-noise ratio reaches 130dB on balanced output and 125dB on single-ended, significantly exceeding the 105dB transparent threshold. Total harmonic distortion measures 0.0002% on balanced and 0.0005% on single-ended outputs, both substantially better than the 0.01% transparent level. Dynamic range of 130dB surpasses the 105dB transparent standard. Output power delivers 150mW per channel at 32Ω via balanced connection, adequate for intended portable applications. However, these values represent manufacturer specifications rather than independent third-party measurements. Conservative evaluation applied due to lack of verified independent testing data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The DEW4X employs dual CS43198 DAC chips representing current-generation flagship technology from Cirrus Logic, featuring 32-bit resolution with advanced oversampled multibit modulation and mismatch shaping technology [1]. Implementation includes UAC1.0/2.0 compatibility, 30-level volume control with memory function, and dual gain switching. Construction utilizes CNC-machined aluminum with replaceable cable design. While the CS43198 represents cutting-edge DAC technology adoption, the overall implementation follows competitive OEM/ODM approaches without significant proprietary technological differentiation. No evidence of patent technology adoption or unique technical innovations beyond standard chip implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Current market price stands at 79 USD. The comparator is Truthear SHIO, another dual CS43198 dongle that adds PCM 768kHz/32-bit plus native DSD256 support, the same 3.5mm/4.4mm outputs with hardware volume and dual gain, and matching objective results (150mW×2 @32Ω, THD+N <0.0002%, SNR 130dB) according to manufacturer data [3][4]. Truthear sells the SHIO for 69.99 USD, aligning with the Nov 18 2025 reference rate applied in the Japanese edition to maintain consistent CP calculations[4][5]. Therefore CP = 69.99 USD ÷ 79 USD = 0.9 for both language versions.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Standard one-year manufacturer warranty applies, below the typical two-year industry standard. Support infrastructure operates primarily through authorized dealer networks with manufacturer backing for defective materials and workmanship. Repair process involves 7-day inspection period followed by repair or replacement. Simple dongle construction with minimal moving components provides inherently robust design resistant to mechanical failure. Simgot's establishment in 2013 provides reasonable company track record. However, warranty period limitation and dealer-dependent support structure prevent higher reliability scoring. Construction quality appears adequate for intended portable use applications.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Simgot demonstrates measurement-focused scientific approach emphasizing technical performance boundaries over subjective audio characteristics [2]. Company philosophy explicitly rejects "fake clarity" and "V-shape bassy wow effects" in favor of "mature engaging high fidelity sound rendering." Engineering team background includes experience from Red Sound Equipment Factory dating to 1985, indicating substantial acoustic engineering foundation. Design costs appear directed toward functional and measured performance improvements through contemporary CS43198 technology adoption. However, implementation follows standard industry approaches without innovative differentiation or proprietary technological advancement. Scientific measurement emphasis aligns with rational audio development principles.

## Advice

The DEW4X represents solid value for users seeking portable high-resolution audio capability with excellent measured specifications. Primary purchase justification centers on 79 USD pricing delivering dual CS43198 performance with robust aluminum construction. Consider the Truthear SHIO at 69.99 USD as a more cost-effective alternative offering equivalent core functionality with superior PCM support and lighter weight [4]. The DEW4X suits users prioritizing slightly premium build quality and brand preference over maximum cost optimization. Avoid if seeking cutting-edge technological innovation or extended warranty coverage beyond standard one-year terms. Recommended for users requiring UAC1.0 compatibility for gaming console applications or preferring replaceable cable design.
