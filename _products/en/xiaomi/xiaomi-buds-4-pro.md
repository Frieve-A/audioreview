## Overview

The Xiaomi Buds 4 Pro is Xiaomi's flagship true wireless earbuds announced in 2023. It features a dual dynamic driver system combining an 11mm aluminum alloy diaphragm and a 6mm titanium diaphragm, with Sony's LDAC codec support enabling hi-res audio playback up to 990kbps and 96kHz/24bit. The earbuds offer up to 48dB active noise cancellation with adaptive environmental recognition for automatic adjustment. Supporting Bluetooth version 5.3, they provide 9 hours of playback on the earbuds alone and 38 hours total with the charging case.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The maximum 48dB active noise cancellation performance is objectively measurable and provides clear auditory benefits to human hearing. LDAC support for 96kHz/24bit hi-res audio reproduction covers frequencies near the upper limit of the audible range, offering auditory improvements when appropriate source material is used. The dual dynamic driver system contributes to improved frequency response linearity through physical separation of the 11mm woofer and 6mm tweeter. The frequency response exhibits neutral midrange with high accuracy and excellent high-frequency extension. However, the low-frequency presence is weak compared to the midrange, leaving room for improvement in overall frequency balance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The dual dynamic driver combining aluminum alloy and titanium diaphragms represents a rational design utilizing material characteristics. LDAC codec implementation achieves 990kbps high bitrate transmission, enabling quality preservation of hi-res audio sources despite Bluetooth transmission. The 48dB ANC performance operates across a wide frequency range up to 4000Hz with three-stage adaptive adjustment functionality. Xiaomi's custom second-generation Ultra Dynamic Dual Magnet Ring technology improves low distortion and linearity. However, these technical elements are combinations of existing technologies, with limited revolutionary proprietary development.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Xiaomi Buds 4 Pro has a current market price of approximately 200 USD. The Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, offering equivalent ANC performance (98.5% noise reduction vs 48dB), LDAC support, and battery life, is available for approximately 99 USD with comparable basic music playback quality. Calculation: 99 USD รท 200 USD = 0.495, rounded to a score of 0.5. The Liberty 4 NC offers superior specifications in some areas including longer 50-hour total battery life versus 38 hours, and wireless charging support. Additionally, the Sony WF-1000XM4 is available for approximately 180-220 USD, providing comparable ANC performance and established sound quality reputation. The Xiaomi Buds 4 Pro's pricing lacks sufficient differentiation from competing products, resulting in moderate cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Xiaomi maintains an established support system as a global smartphone manufacturer, though its experience is limited compared to specialized audio brands. Standard one-year warranty applies with regular firmware updates provided. Integration with the MIUI ecosystem offers convenience improvements for Xiaomi users. However, long-term reliability data for audio equipment is limited, and concerns remain regarding specialized repair support capabilities. While global expansion provides broad support coverage, the ability to handle specialized audio technical issues remains uncertain.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy aimed at objectively measurable sound quality improvements is rational. Frequency separation through dual drivers, hi-res support via LDAC implementation, and maximum 48dB ANC performance are all scientifically-based improvements. Adaptive noise cancellation automatically adjusts through environmental recognition AI, balancing usability and performance. Bone conduction noise reduction for improved call quality represents practical technology implementation. The development approach focusing on measurable performance improvements while eliminating occult claims and unscientific marketing deserves high evaluation. The existence value as dedicated audio equipment is sufficiently established through LDAC support and ANC performance.

## Advice

The Xiaomi Buds 4 Pro is technically excellent true wireless earbuds. Against the approximately 200 USD price point, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC (approximately 99 USD) offers equivalent functionality at roughly half the price, resulting in moderate cost-performance evaluation. Compared to the Sony WF-1000XM4 (approximately 180-220 USD), the pricing is similar and maintains competitive ANC performance and sound quality. For those who value LDAC support and dual driver systems, particularly Xiaomi ecosystem users, this product merits consideration. Before purchasing, always verify the latest prices of competing products and determine the optimal balance of functionality and price for individual needs. For those prioritizing audio quality and cost balance, thorough comparative evaluation is recommended.
