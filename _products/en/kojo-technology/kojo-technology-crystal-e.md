summary: "Well-built Japanese passive grounding box with an 8-layer metal stack. Lacks third-party measurement evidence of audible benefits and is poor value versus cheaper, functionally equivalent options."

## Overview

The **Crystal E** is a passive “virtual ground” box from KOJO TECHNOLOGY (Kojo Seiko, Japan). It uses an **8-layer dissimilar-metal stack** in a compact enclosure and includes RCA-Y and Y-Y ground cables. Marketing claims include a “darker background” and “better definition,” but **no independent measurements** corroborate audible improvements. Note: the **Crystal E-G** (upper model) is the one that touts **68,000 cm²** total surface area; this figure is **not** for the standard Crystal E [10].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Independent tests on **similar grounding boxes** have **failed to show improvements** in THD, SNR, frequency response, or crosstalk; some even **added noise peaks** when connected. In the absence of reproducible, third-party evidence for Crystal E itself, we rate scientific validity very low [1].

---

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The machining, 8-layer metal stack, and solid hardware indicate **decent engineering execution**. However, without measured benefits, this remains **well-made hardware in search of a proven effect** [2].

---

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

- **Crystal E street price (Japan)**: around **¥35,740** at major retailers [3][4].  
- **US pricing**: **379.99 USD** at AccessoryJack [2].  
- **Cheapest equal-or-better alternative** for the same user function (provide a reliable earth reference) with the same measured outcome (no proven audible improvement): **iFi Groundhog+** at **89 USD** [5][6][7].

Given these prices, **value is poor** relative to a purpose-built ground kit; hence **0.2**.

---

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A passive, all-metal device has **few failure modes** and should be robust long-term. Documented **warranty/field reliability data** are limited; support quality likely depends on the retailer and region [2].

---

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Specs like **larger surface area** and **multilayer stacks** are not, by themselves, evidence of **measurable** audio improvements. Given the lack of third-party verification and negative results with similar products, the **design rationale is weak** [1].

---

## Advice

- Start with **proper grounding practice** and **ground-loop troubleshooting**; measure your system to identify noise sources.  
- If you need a ground reference, a **purpose-built ground cable kit** (e.g., iFi Groundhog+) is **much cheaper** and function-appropriate [5][6][7].  
- For audible, repeatable gains, invest in **components with proven measurements** (DACs/amps/speakers).
