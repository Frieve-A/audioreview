## Overview

VIE Style VIE Fit2 represents the company's entry into the true wireless earphone market, featuring their patented "Soft Shell" technology and 360-degree rotating speaker design [1]. Launched via Kickstarter in 2020, these earphones incorporate 8mm neodymium dynamic drivers with Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity and Qualcomm QCC3020 chipset [2]. The product offers 6 hours of continuous playback with an additional 33 hours via the charging case, IPX5 water resistance, and support for SBC/AAC/AptX codecs [1][2]. VIE, primarily a neurotechnology company, partnered with Yamaha for audio technology development in their previous SHAIR headphone project.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data. No credible third-party measurements are available for frequency response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, or sound isolation performance. Manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant measurement data beyond basic driver size and codec support information [1][3]. The 8mm neodymium dynamic drivers and standard Bluetooth codec support (SBC/AAC/AptX) represent conventional implementations without demonstrated performance advantages [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

VIE demonstrates notable technological innovation through their patented "Soft Shell" technology and 360-degree rotating speaker design, providing clear intellectual property differentiation from conventional fixed-angle earphone constructions [1]. The omnidirectional articulating speaker assembly represents in-house design rather than generic OEM implementation [2]. Contemporary wireless technology adoption includes Bluetooth 5.0 and Qualcomm QCC3020 module with dual connection capability for Snapdragon 845+ processors [2]. However, the core wireless implementation remains standard without advanced integration features. The rotating speaker concept shows technical creativity, though its practical benefits require verification through controlled testing.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The VIE Fit2 priced at 69 USD [1] provides true wireless connectivity via Bluetooth 5.0, 6-hour battery life with 33-hour total via case, IPX5 water resistance, and SBC/AAC/AptX codec support [1][2]. Multiple budget alternatives offer equivalent or better user-facing functionality: JLab Go Air Pop at 20 USD provides Bluetooth 5.2, 8-hour battery plus 24-hour case, and IPX4 rating. Skullcandy Dime 3 at 30 USD offers Bluetooth multidevice connectivity, IPX4 resistance, and transparency mode. The average price of equivalent budget alternatives is approximately 25 USD. CP = 25 USD ÷ 69 USD = 0.4.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Multiple documented user reports indicate persistent connection stability issues across various devices including Samsung Galaxy A8 2018, iPhone, and Samsung S8 [4]. Users report "Connection between the earbuds unstable, transmission unstable" and "Connection is unstable on all my BT devices" [4]. The rotating speaker mechanism introduces additional mechanical complexity compared to conventional fixed designs, potentially increasing failure risk [1]. VIE operates as a small Japanese neurotechnology company with limited global support infrastructure compared to major audio manufacturers [1]. User feedback suggests inadequate support response quality [4]. Standard warranty period applies, but the product's complex mechanical design and documented connectivity problems raise concerns about long-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

VIE approaches audio product development from their neurotechnology background, though this scientific foundation does not translate to demonstrable audio measurement improvements [1]. The proprietary rotating speaker mechanism represents innovation attempts but adds manufacturing complexity without validated audible benefits compared to simpler alternatives [1]. Marketing claims about "optimal audio positioning" through 360-degree rotation lack scientific evidence or controlled testing verification [1]. The partnership with Yamaha for audio technology suggests legitimate technical collaboration. Contemporary wireless technology adoption and functional features like IPX5 rating demonstrate practical engineering [2]. However, the design philosophy prioritizes proprietary mechanisms over proven measurement-based performance optimization.

## Advice

The VIE Fit2 targets users seeking unique mechanical design features rather than proven audio performance. The patented rotating speaker technology may appeal to early adopters interested in unconventional earphone constructions. However, documented connection stability issues across multiple device types present significant usability concerns for practical daily use. Since the product is currently sold out with no clear availability timeline, evaluation remains primarily academic. Users seeking similar TWS functionality should consider currently available alternatives with established reliability records and measured performance data. The product represents an interesting technological approach but practical limitations and availability constraints limit its viability as a purchase recommendation.
