## Overview

EPZ K5 is a five-driver hybrid in-ear monitor (1 dynamic + 4 balanced armatures). The shell is DLP 3D-printed resin with a standard 0.78 mm 2-pin connector; the stock cable supports interchangeable 2.5/3.5/4.4 mm plugs. Published specs list sensitivity around 114 dB/mW and impedance around 28–30 Ω. Isolation claims up to ~26 dB are noted by retailers. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent lab measurements of the K5’s frequency response and distortion are not widely published at this time. This section therefore relies on seller-listed specifications: frequency response 20–20,000 Hz; impedance 30 Ω [1] or 28 Ω [2]; sensitivity 114 dB/mW [1] or 114±3 dB [2]; isolation up to 26 dB [2]. These figures set expectations but are not substitutes for third-party data, so the score stays conservative. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design combines a composite-diaphragm 8 mm dynamic driver with four balanced armatures in a three-way passive crossover, packaged in a 3D-printed resin shell with a modular-plug cable. This is a competent, modern implementation for the price tier, though not novel. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Basis (US):** K5 **108 USD**. Comparator: **Truthear HEXA 79.99 USD**. **Computation:** 79.99 ÷ 108 = **0.74** → **0.7** after rounding.  
**Equivalence note:** Both are wired IEMs with detachable cables; third-party testing shows HEXA has minimal FR deviation and strong passive isolation without ANC, meeting or exceeding user-visible performance expectations. [3][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Distributor policy lists **30-day returns (factory-sealed)** and **1-year warranty on IEMs / 3-month on cable**. Long-term RMA/MTBF data is not available from independent sources, so the score remains average. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

K5 follows established hybrid IEM practice (bass on DD, mids/highs on BA) with practical ergonomics and accessories. No claims conflict with mainstream audio science; the approach is sensible rather than groundbreaking. [1][2]

## Advice

If you want a **data-proven** neutralish tuning at a lower price, **Truthear HEXA** is the safer bet. Choose **K5** if you prefer its hybrid build, shell ergonomics, and modular plug system, accepting that independent acoustic measurements for K5 are limited today. [1][3][4]
