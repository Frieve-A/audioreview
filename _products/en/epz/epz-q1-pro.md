## Overview

EPZ’s Q1 Pro is a budget wired in-ear monitor using a 10 mm single dynamic driver with an LCP+PU composite diaphragm in compact 3D-printed resin shells and a 0.78 mm 2-pin detachable cable [1][2]. Typical retail pricing sits around 29–40 USD depending on store and bundle [2][14]. The tuning targets a neutral-bright balance broadly consistent with common Harman/VDSF targets per independent FR databases and multiple reviews [2][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Relevant, verifiable numbers exist but do not reach transparent thresholds for earphones. Manufacturer specs list THD <0.5 % at 1 kHz/100 dB, impedance 32 Ω, and sensitivity either 110 dB ± 1 dB @ 1 Vrms on the official page or 100 dB ± 3 dB @ 1 Vrms as summarized in a review—showing spec variance that warrants caution [1][2]. Third-party frequency-response collections place Q1 Pro near a Harman-leaning target (good tonality context) but not within ±1 dB transparency across 20 Hz–20 kHz [4]. Passive isolation is described as above-average for a small resin shell, but no lab isolation/THD sweeps are published [2]. Net: measurable competence with target-conforming FR, short of transparency.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design employs widely used approaches in this class: 10 mm dual-cavity/dual-magnet dynamic driver, LCP+PU diaphragm, and high-precision 3D-printed resin shells with metal nozzles [1]. These are sound but conventional implementations without published proprietary algorithms, patents, or novel acoustical architectures.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Denominator (review target price):** 35 USD.  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **Moondrop Chu II**, typically **22.99 USD** list at a global retailer (current page shows a temporary lower sale price; list price used as representative) [3].  
**Equivalence note:** Both are wired single-DD IEMs with detachable 0.78 mm cables; Chu II’s FR is also target-aligned and manufacturer distortion spec is ≤0.5 % (comparable), so user-visible functions and core measured performance are equivalent-or-better [3][4].

**CP calculation (required simple division):** 22.99 USD ÷ 35 USD = **0.657** → **0.7** (first-decimal rounding).  

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

EPZ offers standard budget-segment warranty and retail channel support; long-term RMA/MTBF data are not published. Build quality is consistently reported as good for the price (clean resin shells, secure 2-pin), but the brand’s long-term field reliability is still developing [2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A target-oriented FR and avoidance of occult claims are rational choices that tend to improve audible fidelity when executed well. The product messaging focuses on plausible engineering (driver, diaphragm, cavity) rather than untestable assertions [1][2]. The approach is practical and evidence-friendly even if not groundbreaking.

## Advice

Q1 Pro suits budget buyers wanting a compact, comfortable resin IEM with neutral-bright tonality and detachable cables. If value is the priority, Chu II at a lower price offers essentially the same feature set and comparable measured behavior [3][4]. If you require fully transparent-level performance with published lab-grade distortion/isolation data, consider stepping up to models with comprehensive third-party measurements.
