## Overview

The EPZ × Tipsy Star One is a single 10 mm dual-magnet, dual-cavity dynamic-driver IEM using an LCP+PU composite diaphragm. It is positioned at 89 USD and marketed for live broadcast and stage monitoring with a high nominal impedance of 64 Ω and passive “noise reduction” claim of 26 dB (manufacturer). Resin shells (black/white) use 3D-printed cavities and a detachable 0.78 mm QDC-type 2-pin cable [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, standardized measurements for Star One remain sparse. Manufacturer specs list 20 Hz–40 kHz response, 64 Ω impedance, and 112 dB/Vrms sensitivity [1]. Third-party reviews consistently describe a U-shaped/Harman-leaning balance with elevated upper-mids/treble and restrained mid-bass, supported by reviewer-published FR graphs and listening notes [2][3]. However, we found **no** credible third-party THD/IMD/crosstalk datasets under controlled conditions; the 26 dB isolation figure is a catalog claim without lab verification [1]. Given the lack of comprehensive independent data, the score remains centered at 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design employs a conventional single dynamic driver with dual-cavity/dual-magnet motor and an LCP+PU diaphragm—common choices at this price. We found no patents, proprietary acoustic structures, or published engineering papers that would indicate category-leading implementation. Manufacturing (3D-printed resin shells) is competent but not novel [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

A cheaper, equal-or-better alternative exists: **Truthear HEXA** (1DD+3BA), widely documented to track neutral targets closely with good technical execution (multiple third-party FR databases; measured passive isolation −21.2 dB full-band at RTINGS) [4][5][6]. Current market price: **79.99 USD** [6].  
**CP calculation (USD basis):** 79.99 USD ÷ 89 USD = **0.899** → rounded to **0.9**.

*Equivalence note:* HEXA provides equal-or-better user-visible performance via closer-to-neutral FR (per third-party databases) and independently measured isolation; manufacturer specs indicate low THD at 94 dB (catalog) [5][6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

EPZ/Tipsy provide standard coverage through retail partners. The Linsoul product page states a **1-year IEM warranty** (cable three months) and 30-day returns; long-term field reliability data remain limited for this collaboration [1]. Detachable QDC-type 2-pin connectors support easy cable replacement.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Targeting live/broadcast monitoring with high impedance is a coherent market angle, but the U-shaped/bright tilt departs from neutral monitor ideals. Emphasis on aesthetic panels and glitter shells suggests priority on styling alongside functionality. Without publicly verifiable distortion and consistency data, the monitoring claim remains partly unsubstantiated [1][2].

## Advice

Star One suits listeners who want a comfortable resin IEM with high nominal impedance and a lively upper-mid/treble focus. For neutral reference use or value-driven transparency, **Truthear HEXA** (79.99 USD) is the safer measured pick, with extensive third-party FR data and verified isolation [4][5][6]. The Star One can run from a phone, but multiple reviewers recommend at least a small dongle DAC for best results [2]. If you prefer a similarly priced alternative with broad community measurements, **Moondrop Aria 2** (≈ 89.99 USD) is also worth a look [7].
