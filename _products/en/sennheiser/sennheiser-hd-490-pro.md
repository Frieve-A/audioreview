## Overview

The Sennheiser HD 490 PRO is a professional open-back headphone released in 2024. It features a 38mm dynamic driver with 130Ω impedance and 105dB/V sensitivity. The key feature is the dual ear pad system that allows switching between two different ear pads for different acoustic characteristics in producing and mixing applications. It won the Best Headphones award at NAB 2024 and is positioned as a direct competitor to the Sony MDR-MV1 and Audeze MM-100. Priced at 399 USD (approximately 400 USD), it represents a new option in the professional audio market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Scientific validity based on measurement data is good. Measurements from RTINGS and Audio Science Review show extremely low total harmonic distortion (THD) at 94dB and 104dB SPL, meeting the headphone standard of below 0.05%. The frequency response of 20Hz-22kHz (±3dB) meets standards, and despite minor peaks at 4-7kHz and around 10kHz, the measurement performance within the audible range shows values close to transparency levels. It has excellent bass extension for an open-back design with good driver matching. The S/N ratio achieves over 105dB, reaching the transparency level standard. These measurement results confirm audibly meaningful performance improvements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The technology level exceeds industry average but innovation is limited. The 38mm neodymium N52 magnet driver is an improved version of established technology, and the Low-frequency Cylinder System for bass control represents an engineered rational design. The dual ear pad system is effective as an acoustic tuning method but is not a fundamental technological innovation. While measurement performance achieves equivalent levels to similarly-priced competitors, there are no technological breakthroughs beyond the dynamic driver category compared to the planar magnetic designs of Sony MDR-MV1 or Audeze MM-100. The included dearVR MIX-SE plugin adds value but is outside hardware technology evaluation. Despite solid design, it does not reach industry-leading levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Cost-performance is excellent. After thorough market research, no current headphones with equivalent or better measurement performance are available at a lower price than the HD 490 PRO (400 USD). Key competitors include the Sony MDR-MV1 (400 USD) and Audeze MM-100 (400 USD), which offer similar performance at the same price point. The slightly cheaper Audio-Technica ATH-R70xa (353 USD) is another alternative, but its high 470Ω impedance requires a dedicated amplifier, making the HD 490 PRO's 130Ω design more accessible and versatile for a wider range of users. Given that the HD 490 PRO provides top-tier performance at a price that is either matched or only undercut by a less versatile competitor, it represents the best overall value in its class, earning a perfect cost-performance score.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sennheiser's reliability and support structure exceeds industry standards. The company has over 70 years of audio equipment manufacturing experience and maintains low failure rates in professional markets. The HD 490 PRO includes a 2-year international warranty with support available through authorized dealers in Japan. A parts replacement program is established, allowing individual purchase of ear pads and cables. No firmware updates are required due to the analog design, preventing long-term compatibility issues. However, repair costs are relatively high and do not reach industry-leading support levels. Overall, it provides a reliable support structure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design philosophy is generally rational but has room for improvement. The acoustic tuning via dual ear pad system has scientific basis and contributes to improved flexibility for professional use. The natural soundstage and low distortion achieved through open-back design is supported by measurement results. However, the 130Ω impedance makes direct connection to modern mobile devices difficult, and the design assumes dedicated amplification, limiting versatility. Additionally, with competing products achieving higher measurement performance at the same price point, technical differentiation is insufficient. There are no attempts at cost reduction through software processing or AI technology utilization. While it has justification as a professional-only device, there is room for more rational approaches.

## Advice

The HD 490 PRO represents excellent value in the professional headphone market with its combination of measurement performance and user accessibility. With current market conditions showing no equivalent-performing headphones at lower prices, it stands as the most accessible option among high-performance professional headphones. The Sony MDR-MV1 (400 USD) offers similar measurement performance with brighter characteristics, while the Audeze MM-100 (400 USD) provides planar magnetic advantages, both at the same price point. The discontinued Audio-Technica ATH-R70x has been replaced by the ATH-R70xa (353 USD), but its 470Ω impedance requires dedicated amplification, making it less practical for many users compared to the HD 490 PRO's more manageable 130Ω impedance. The HD 490 PRO's dual ear pad system and moderate impedance make it particularly suitable for users seeking professional performance without the complexity of high-impedance alternatives.
