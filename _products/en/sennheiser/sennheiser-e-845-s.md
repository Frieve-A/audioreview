## Overview

The Sennheiser e-845-S is a dynamic super cardioid microphone designed for live vocal and speech applications, featuring an integrated on/off switch. This German-manufactured microphone employs shock-mounted capsule technology with hum compensating coil for interference rejection. The e-845-S represents Sennheiser's traditional approach to live vocal microphones, emphasizing robust metal construction and focused pickup patterns for stage use. With dimensions of 185mm length and 46mm diameter, it targets professional performers requiring reliable vocal reproduction in demanding live environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The e-845-S demonstrates adequate performance in available measurements but lacks comprehensive third-party verification. Maximum SPL capability in excess of 150dB exceeds the 140dB excellent threshold for microphones, indicating strong capability for high-output applications. Frequency range of 40Hz-16kHz covers essential vocal applications but falls short of the ideal 20Hz-20kHz full audible spectrum. The super cardioid pickup pattern provides focused sound capture appropriate for live performance environments. However, critical measurements including S/N ratio and equivalent noise level remain unavailable from manufacturer specifications, preventing complete scientific evaluation. Conservative evaluation applied due to limited measurement data availability and lack of independent third-party verification [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The e-845-S employs mature dynamic microphone technology with shock-mounted capsule and hum compensating coil implementation. Sennheiser's in-house design demonstrates accumulated expertise in microphone engineering, particularly the extensive suspension system for handling noise reduction. However, the technology represents conventional approaches without significant advancement beyond established industry standards. The analog-only design lacks integration with modern digital connectivity or signal processing capabilities. Manufacturing in Germany ensures quality control but the underlying dynamic transducer technology offers limited competitive advantage duration, as similar implementations are readily achievable by competitors.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Among dynamic vocal microphones, there is currently no cheaper model we can confirm (from manufacturer-published specifications or credible sources) that matches both the e-845-S’s 40Hz–16kHz frequency range and a published maximum SPL at or above 140dB [1]. When no lower-priced equal-or-better option exists, cost-performance becomes 1.0. If a verified cheaper equivalent appears, this section will be updated accordingly.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The e-845-S excels in reliability and support provision. Sennheiser offers an exceptional 10-year warranty in the USA (2 years in other regions), significantly exceeding industry standard coverage. The simple dynamic microphone structure with robust metal housing provides inherent resistance to failure, while German manufacturing ensures consistent quality control. Global Sennheiser support infrastructure facilitates professional repair services and customer assistance. The company's established track record in microphone reliability, combined with the straightforward dynamic transducer design containing few moving parts, supports long-term operational dependability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sennheiser demonstrates measurement-based engineering approach with documented frequency response characteristics and specification transparency, indicating scientific product development methodology. The dynamic microphone technology selection is rational for live vocal applications, providing appropriate performance characteristics without unnecessary complexity. The company's long-term commitment to innovation since 1945 reflects systematic approach to audio technology advancement. However, the design lacks integration of modern digital connectivity or signal processing capabilities that could enhance user functionality. The focus on traditional analog implementation, while reliable, represents conservative approach rather than progressive technology adoption for contemporary user requirements.

## Advice

The e-845-S serves users requiring reliable live vocal microphone with proven Sennheiser quality and extended warranty coverage. Consider this microphone if you prioritize brand heritage, robust construction, and exceptional warranty support over cost efficiency. However, budget-conscious users should evaluate the Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB, which provides equivalent vocal performance with superior dual connectivity at significantly lower price. The e-845-S justifies its premium primarily through warranty coverage and brand reliability rather than technical superiority. Professional performers in demanding environments may appreciate the robust construction, but home studio users will find better value in dual-connectivity alternatives that offer both analog and digital output options.
