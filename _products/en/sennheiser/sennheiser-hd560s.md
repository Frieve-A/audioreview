## Overview

The Sennheiser HD560S, released in 2020, is an open-back dynamic headphone designed to deliver a neutral sound at a more accessible price point, inheriting the company's traditional high-fidelity design philosophy. It features 38mm drivers with a 120-ohm impedance, 110 dB @ 1V sensitivity, and a 6 Hz - 38 kHz frequency response, characterized by a wide sound field thanks to E.A.R. (Ergonomic Acoustic Refinement) technology. This model was developed for the prosumer market, leveraging technical feedback from the higher-end HD600 series.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The HD560S achieves a remarkably linear frequency response over a wide range of 6 Hz to 38 kHz, earning high praise from numerous measurement sites. With a 120-ohm impedance and 110 dB @ 1V sensitivity, it is designed to produce sufficient volume even without a dedicated amplifier. Independent measurements confirm a flat response within ±3 dB in the 20 Hz-20 kHz range, meeting the criteria for its category. The official specification of THD at 0.05% (1 kHz/90 dB SPL) indicates excellent distortion characteristics, which are corroborated by real-world measurements. The open-back design also contributes to a good soundstage, resulting in a well-aligned product in terms of both measured performance and auditory perception.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Modern approaches are adopted, including angled 38mm dynamic drivers and sound field optimization via E.A.R. technology. While its 2020 design is relatively recent, it faces the physical limitations of dynamic drivers when compared to newer technologies like planar magnetic drivers. Although Sennheiser's proprietary acoustic design expertise is evident, innovative technological elements are limited, placing it at a standard level within the industry. It is a solid design, but not a technological breakthrough.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The current market price of the HD560S is 114 USD (as of July 2025). A competing product with equivalent or superior performance, the HiFiMan HE400se, is available for 90 USD. The HE400se features planar magnetic drivers, making it a technologically excellent alternative. Based on our policy, we calculate the cost-performance by comparing it to the least expensive product with equivalent performance, the HE400se. The calculation is "90 USD ÷ 114 USD = 0.793...". Rounding to the first decimal place, the score is 0.8. While not the cheapest, it represents a competitive price point for its performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As a long-established manufacturer, Sennheiser maintains a solid reputation for reliability. Although its consumer electronics division was transferred to Sonova Holding AG in 2021, product support continues. The HD560S is a relatively new product with limited long-term reliability data, but based on the track record of the company's previous products, above-average quality can be expected. The warranty period is standard for the industry, and repair services are available. As a hardware-fixed product, no firmware updates are expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design philosophy of the HD560S is scientifically-based and rational. Its neutral tuning is adjusted based on measurement data, and the approach of avoiding subjective sound shaping is commendable. The 120-ohm impedance design offers flexibility, allowing it to be driven by many devices while also showing performance gains with a dedicated amplifier. The open-back design and E.A.R. technology are acoustically sound. While the existence of cheaper competitors means its pricing strategy is not perfectly rational, the overall product approach is sound.

## Advice

The HD560S is an excellent choice for users seeking a neutral and accurate sound. Its measured performance is impressive for its price, and it will likely provide a satisfying listening experience in most setups. However, at its price of 114 USD, the presence of strong competitors cannot be ignored. Specifically, the HiFiMan HE400se (90 USD) offers high performance with a different technological approach (planar magnetic) at a lower cost. If you value the reliability of the Sennheiser brand and its sound signature, the HD560S is a strong contender. However, if you are purely chasing cost-performance, you should also consider the more affordable alternatives.
