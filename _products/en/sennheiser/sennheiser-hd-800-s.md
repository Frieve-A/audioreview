summary: "The Sennheiser HD 800 S is a legendary open-back headphone with an innovative 56mm ring radiator. While its measured performance is excellent, its 1,799 USD price results in extremely low cost-performance compared to the HiFiMan Sundara (235 USD), which boasts superior accuracy in frequency response. Although the design is rational, the product's price is not justified by its performance."

## Overview

The Sennheiser HD 800 S is a flagship open-back headphone released by German audio manufacturer Sennheiser in 2015. It features a 56mm ring radiator dynamic driver and a high impedance design of 300Ω, requiring high-quality headphone amplifiers for optimal performance. With specifications including a weight of 330g and frequency response of 4-51,000Hz, it is positioned as a reference-grade product. As a product carrying the history and tradition of the Sennheiser brand, it has garnered attention from many audiophiles.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The HD 800 S achieves measured performance at transparent levels. THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) shows an excellent value of 0.02% (1kHz, 1V RMS), which while not reaching the policy's transparent level standard of below 0.01%, significantly surpasses the problematic level of 0.1%. The frequency response spans 4-51,000Hz in a wide bandwidth, and RTINGS measurements show low harmonic distortion at 94dB/SPL and 104dB/SPL. S/N ratio varies by measurement but generally shows values above 100dB, reaching transparent levels. The 300Ω high impedance design delivers excellent measured results when paired with appropriate amplifiers. Group delay performance is also good, with favorable low-frequency phase characteristics.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 56mm ring radiator dynamic driver represents a technically interesting design. Unlike conventional dynamic drivers, the center portion of the diaphragm is fixed, with only the ring-shaped portion being driven. This suppresses modal breakup and achieves more linear operation. The 300Ω high impedance design also contributes to improved noise resistance and reduced influence from driving circuits. However, this technology has not seen significant advancement since its 2015 development, and with the proliferation of new technologies like planar magnetic drivers, its relative technological advantage has diminished. While design uniqueness is recognized, the technology level remains moderate compared to current industry-leading standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Cost-performance receives an extremely low evaluation. The HD 800 S market price is 1,799 USD, but the HiFiMan Sundara with equivalent or superior measured performance is available for 235 USD. Calculation: 235 USD ÷ 1,799 USD = 0.131, which rounds to a score of 0.1. The HiFiMan Sundara employs planar magnetic drivers, showing comparable performance in THD and S/N ratio, and even surpasses the HD 800 S in terms of frequency response neutrality (lacking the peak around 6kHz). While the HD 800 S possesses a vast soundstage, this subjective advantage cannot justify the price difference based on objective measurements. Excluding brand value, it is a significantly overpriced option based on pure performance-to-price ratio.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a long-established major manufacturer, Sennheiser's reliability and support meet industry standards. The warranty is a standard two years, and the repair system is well-established. The HD 800 S is a long-selling flagship model, and the availability of essential replacement parts like earpads and cables is a plus. However, no extended warranty is offered, so the evaluation remains within the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design philosophy shows a degree of rationality. The distinctive 56mm ring radiator driver is an innovative technology with a clear engineering goal: to suppress breakup modes in large-diaphragm drivers and improve high-frequency performance. The 300Ω high-impedance design is also a rational approach, aiming for stable operation that is less affected by an amplifier's output impedance. However, the performance achieved by these technologies can now be matched or exceeded by simpler and more cost-effective technologies like planar magnetic drivers. Therefore, while the design philosophy is scientific, it no longer represents the most cost-effective approach in the modern context.

## Advice

Prospective buyers are strongly advised to first try the HiFiMan Sundara (235 USD), which offers far superior cost-performance. The Sundara rivals the HD 800 S in distortion and S/N ratio and is potentially superior in frequency response accuracy, all at less than one-eighth of the price. You must calmly judge whether the HD 800 S's main attraction, its vast soundstage, is worth the significant price difference. Unless you prioritize the Sennheiser brand and its historical value, the Sundara is the more rational choice when considering the balance of pure performance and cost. The necessity of a powerful headphone amplifier also needs to be considered in the total system cost.
