## Overview

The Sennheiser HD-505 positions itself as "the perfect way to start your journey into the audiophile listening experience" with a 279.95 USD price point. Built on the established HD 500 series chassis, it features custom 120-ohm transducers manufactured in Ireland, delivering 12 Hz to 38,500 Hz frequency response. The modular design allows tool-free cable and earpad swapping, targeting users stepping up from gaming headsets into analytical audio listening.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specifications claim THD less than 0.2% at 1kHz/90dB SPL [1]. Third-party measurements from Unheard Lab confirm frequency response maintains relatively close adherence to the Harman OE 2018 target across most frequencies, with elevation in the 7-9kHz region including peaks at 7kHz and 8.3kHz [3]. SoundGuys measurements corroborate the general frequency response characteristics [2]. Measured impedance is 137Ω at 1kHz [3]. At 94dB SPL, bass distortion is higher than the HD 560S with third-order harmonic components present [3]. Open-back design provides minimal passive sound isolation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The HD-505 demonstrates competent in-house engineering using established technologies. Angled 38mm dynamic transducers replicate nearfield loudspeaker positioning, while open-back architecture provides spatial presentation [1]. Custom impedance tuning and Ireland manufacturing showcase accumulated know-how. However, core technologies represent well-established approaches widely used across the audiophile market, lacking cutting-edge innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

Current market price: 279.95 USD [1].

Comparison target: Sennheiser HD 560S at 199.99 USD [6]. Equipped with detachable cable, 120Ω impedance, and 3.5mm connectivity, and THD (less than 0.05% at 90dB SPL [4]) and frequency response are equivalent-or-better.

CP = 199.99 USD ÷ 279.95 USD = 0.7

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Standard 24-month manufacturer warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship, with global service partner network and repair options available [5]. Simple modular design supports long-term usability with user-replaceable earpads and cables. Non-standard cable connector may limit third-party replacement options, requiring specific Sennheiser-compatible cables [3].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Sennheiser claims analytical tuning with "punchy bass, effortless mids, and non-fatiguing treble" targeting emerging audiophiles [1]. The 237-gram lightweight construction and modular component approach support extended listening sessions. However, measured 8.3kHz peak contradicts "non-fatiguing treble" claims [3]. Cost allocation emphasizes performance over aesthetics, though significant premium over HD-560S at 199.99 USD raises questions about value positioning.

## Advice

The HD-505 serves users seeking entry into analytical audio listening with established Sennheiser engineering quality. The modular design and analytical tuning provide growth potential for developing audiophiles. However, comfort concerns from headband padding and occasional treble harshness may limit extended use sessions. Consider trying before purchasing due to comfort issues, and budget for potential cable replacement given non-standard connector. Alternative consideration of HD-560S at current market pricing may provide similar analytical experience with different comfort characteristics.
