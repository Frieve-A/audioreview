## Overview

The Sennheiser HD 560S represents the company's entry-level audiophile offering, launched September 2020 at 199.99 USD. These open-back headphones employ E.A.R. technology with 9° angled driver alignment and 120Ω impedance for analytical listening. The design targets studio reference applications with claimed neutral tuning and wide 6Hz-38kHz frequency response. Sennheiser positions this model between consumer and professional segments, emphasizing measurement-based performance over subjective appeal.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third-party measurements from Audio Science Review show THD below 0.05% at 90 dB SPL, indicating excellent distortion control [1]. Reference Audio Analyzer reports sensitivity of 111.1 dB SPL with impedance measurements of 161.6 ohms [2]. Frequency response analysis reveals nearly flat performance up to 3kHz with 3-5dB brightness above 4kHz [3]. ASR measurements demonstrate very close compliance with target response across broad frequency regions. The documented measurement variations between sources reflect standard test rig differences rather than performance inconsistencies.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The HD 560S incorporates multiple proprietary technologies including E.A.R. angled driver positioning and advanced damping systems [4]. The 38mm dynamic driver features specialized polymer-blend membrane material for enhanced clarity above 10kHz. Manufacturing combines German design with established production techniques in Ireland and China. While the technologies represent solid engineering advancement over previous models, the purely analog design lacks modern digital integration. The in-house development by an established manufacturer with significant acoustic expertise elevates the technology assessment.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

CP = 1.0 (no cheaper equivalent-or-better product exists)

Comprehensive market analysis found no products offering equivalent-or-better measured performance at lower pricing. Comparison candidates including HiFiMAN HE400SE (0.2% THD vs required <0.05%), Philips SHP9500 (multiple treble peaks), and Audio-Technica ATH-AD700X (7dB midrange dip) all demonstrated inferior measured performance [5]. This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The HD 560S represents optimal value for neutral-tuned open-back headphones with verified low distortion.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sennheiser provides 24-month warranty coverage for manufacturing defects with global repair service network [6]. Some users have reported isolated quality issues including loose screws causing rattling sounds, particularly in the right driver, and structural noise from headband movement. However, no statistical failure rate data (RMA ratio, MTBF) is available to confirm whether these represent widespread reliability problems or isolated incidents. Parts availability remains strong through official channels and third-party suppliers. The brand's established reputation for longevity and recent manufacturing improvements support reliability assessment. Service communication delays have been reported by some users.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Sennheiser demonstrates highly rational design approach focused on measurement-based performance rather than subjective marketing. Published specifications include precise THD values and frequency response ranges with third-party verification available. Cost allocation prioritizes performance and function over premium materials or aesthetic elements. The progression from HD 559 shows measurable technical improvements while maintaining competitive pricing. Marketing claims like "reveal the truth in your music" align with documented neutral tuning and low distortion specifications [7]. The analytical positioning avoids common subjective-only approaches.

## Advice

For users requiring neutral-tuned open-back headphones with verified low distortion, the HD 560S provides optimal value at its price point. The analytical tuning suits studio monitoring and critical listening applications. Potential buyers should consider the documented loose screw issues and plan for possible warranty service. The 120Ω impedance allows operation from most sources but benefits from dedicated amplification. Users seeking warmer or more colored sound signatures should consider alternatives, as the neutral tuning prioritizes accuracy over subjective appeal.
