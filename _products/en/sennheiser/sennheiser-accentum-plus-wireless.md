## Overview

Launched in February 2024 at 229.95 USD, the Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless bridges the entry Accentum line and the Momentum series. It adds adaptive hybrid ANC, a carrying case, touch controls, analog and USB audio, multipoint Bluetooth, and extended battery life over the base Accentum model [3][6]. Official materials and third-party testing confirm Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX Adaptive support and a measured continuous battery life well beyond the claim [1][6].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent measurements show a bass-emphasized response with mostly balanced mids and cooler treble, plus unit-to-unit/intra-wear variability typical of closed-back ANC designs [1]. Weighted harmonic distortion is controlled but not reference-class: **WHD @90 dB: 0.312; @100 dB: 0.131** (Audio Precision APx517B; Bluetooth aptX HD 24-bit/48 kHz; ANC Max; firmware **3.14.9**) [1]. ANC effectiveness is good yet short of class leaders: **full-range overall attenuation −19.29 dB** (Bass −9.98 dB / Mid −20.66 dB / Treble −29.09 dB), and in common scenarios **airplane −13.84 dB**, office −14.43 dB, street −15.83 dB [1]. Battery life measured **56 hours** with ANC on (vs 50 hours advertised) [1]. These numbers indicate competent performance for fidelity-relevant metrics (FR/THD/ANC), but not at transparent levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The feature set—adaptive hybrid ANC, touch panel, multipoint, and long battery—leans on established approaches and parts rather than introducing novel transducer or ANC architectures. Sennheiser’s communication highlights codec support (aptX Adaptive) and usability features, with minimal evidence of new core acoustic technology beyond tuning and controls [3][6]. Overall, solid implementation of current standards rather than state-advancing design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A cheaper **equivalent-or-better** option exists: **Anker Soundcore Space Q45**. It offers adaptive ANC, multipoint, app EQ, wired and BT playback, and delivers **stronger measured ANC** (**overall −23.55 dB; airplane −19.97 dB**) with **comparable distortion** (**WHD @90 dB: 0.331; @100 dB: 0.167**) on RTINGS’ bench [4]. A representative current market price is **149.99 USD** [9].  
**CP calculation:** 149.99 USD ÷ 230 USD = **0.652** → rounded to **0.7**.  
Given equal user-facing functions and ANC/THD metrics that are equivalent-or-better for isolation and comparable for distortion, the Q45 sets a lower price baseline than the Accentum Plus [1][4][9].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Sennheiser provides a 24-month warranty and the Smart Control app for updates and EQ/ANC tuning. RTINGS tested on firmware **3.14.9** and documents consistent app functionality [1]. The support footprint is mature and global, with typical consumer experiences (neither outstanding nor poor) reflected across reputable outlets. No hard failure-rate or MTBF data is publicly disclosed.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Plus emphasizes battery life, convenience, and codec variety more than pushing measurable acoustic transparency. Third-party data shows competent but unexceptional FR consistency and ANC depth relative to the best performers [1]. The direction is practical for travelers, but from a pure fidelity/measurement standpoint, it prioritizes features over breakthroughs.

## Advice

If you value long battery life, USB/analog flexibility, and an easy companion app, the Accentum Plus performs reliably. However, shoppers driven by **measured** ANC effectiveness and price should consider the **Anker Soundcore Space Q45** first given its stronger ANC numbers at a significantly lower typical street price [4][9]. Those seeking top-tier ANC depth can look at Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose QuietComfort Ultra (usually higher priced) [1].
