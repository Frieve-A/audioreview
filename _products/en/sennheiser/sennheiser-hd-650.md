summary: "A benchmark open-back since 2003 with measurement-backed, stable performance. Its response isn't fully transparent by modern criteria, and the design is no longer cutting-edge in 2025. Parts availability underpins reliability. Cost-performance is further tempered by the HiFiMan HE400se at 109 USD, which qualifies as equivalent-or-better on measured performance."

## Overview

The HD 650 is an open-back headphone with a 300-ohm load and modular construction. Official specs list 10Hz–41kHz bandwidth, 103dB (1V) sensitivity, and THD <0.05% at 1kHz/1V [1]. A representative US market price is 349.95 USD [4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third-party measurements show mildly under-emphasized bass and a gentle treble roll-off—flat-leaning but not fully "transparent" [2][8]. Distortion is low: the maker rates THD <0.05% at 1kHz/1V, and RTINGS' weighted distortion metric is likewise low (WHD @100 ≈0.063) [1][2]. These data align with the headphone's midrange clarity and long-term listening comfort [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Careful damping, metal mesh grills, and a serviceable, modular build are rational choices [1]. Still, this is a single dynamic driver design from the early 2000s; against today's most advanced low-distortion designs, its technological edge is moderate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Comparator must be the cheapest product with **equivalent-or-better** user-facing functions and measured performance. **HiFiMan HE400se** qualifies via strong target compliance and exceptionally low distortion [9].  
HE400se: **109 USD**; HD 650: **350 USD** [10][4].  
`CP = 109 USD ÷ 350 USD = 0.3`.  
(For context, the Drop **HD 6XX** remains a similar-performance option at 199 USD [3][5].)

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Genuine spare parts (e.g., cable 092885) remain available and retailers list a 2-year manufacturer warranty [6][7][4]. Hard failure-rate data are scarce, but parts access plus warranty support suggest above-average maintainability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

High-impedance operation aiming for low distortion, open-back staging, and an easily serviceable structure are science-aligned choices [1]. The measured response is not perfectly transparent, and pricing isn't disruptive by today's standards [2][8]. Net: rational and durable rather than aggressively cutting-edge.

## Advice

Pair with a capable desktop amp if you value natural mids and fatigue-free listening. If you prioritize stronger sub-bass or airier top-end, consider alternatives. For value-first buyers, **HE400se (109 USD)** is the lowest-cost path to comparable measured performance [9][10]. If official support, build consistency, and straightforward parts sourcing matter, the HD 650 remains an easy recommendation [1][4][6][7].
