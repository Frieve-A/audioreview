## Overview

Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless is an over-ear wireless headphone with active noise cancelling (ANC). It features up to 60 hours of battery life, 42 mm dynamic drivers, a rated 6 Hz–22 kHz frequency response, Bluetooth 5.2, and support for SBC/AAC/aptX/aptX Adaptive [1]. Released in 2022.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

We separate manufacturer specs and third-party measurements. While the rated frequency response is 6 Hz–22 kHz [1], third-party measurements show low distortion and good in-band balance within the audible range [2]. ANC provides overall effective attenuation and improves listening S/N in real use [2]. Some metrics do not reach absolute transparent levels, so the score is 0.7.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design is sound: 42 mm dynamic drivers, Bluetooth 5.2, and SBC/AAC/aptX/aptX Adaptive support [1]. The up to 60-hour battery life is a category strength. Hybrid ANC and the Smart Control app enable EQ and ongoing feature updates [1]. Innovation is not groundbreaking, hence 0.7.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Per definition, select the single cheapest product with equivalent-or-better user-facing functions and measured performance. Representative competitors like Sony WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are typically more expensive than the MOMENTUM 4 [3][4]. As we could not confirm any cheaper equivalent-or-better option at the time of review, CP becomes 1.0 by definition.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sennheiser provides standard warranty and global support. The Smart Control app offers continued feature improvements and settings [1]. Specific failure rates are not widely published; we rate 0.8 based on track record.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Measurement-backed choices (ANC attenuation, band balance, practical battery life) are rational [1][2]. A clear advantage over general-purpose devices is not always evident; we rate 0.7.

## Advice

This model suits users prioritizing long battery life and overall performance including fit and app features. If the absolute strongest ANC is your priority, consider Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose QuietComfort Ultra; note they are typically pricier than this model [3][4]. Given price-to-performance and reliability, MOMENTUM 4 is a strong choice.
