## Overview

The Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless is a wireless headphone released in 2019 by German audio manufacturer Sennheiser. It features 42 mm large drivers with active noise cancelling (ANC) functionality. It supports Bluetooth 5.0 and high-quality codecs including aptX and aptX Low Latency. The headphones weigh about 305 g and offer around 17 hours of continuous playback. They feature a premium appearance with genuine leather and versatility with wired connection support.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The measured performance of the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless is mid-tier. Third-party measurements generally report somewhat elevated distortion in the bass region. Overall performance is practical but leaves room for improvement. The frequency response covers a wide band and in some cases shows a boosted bass profile. ANC effectiveness is sufficient for daily use, though optimization relative to the newest processing generations remains possible.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design uses a standard configuration with 42 mm dynamic drivers and Bluetooth 5.0. With aptX and aptX Low Latency support, low-latency playback is possible, and the headset includes multiple microphones for noise control and calls. Supporting both wired and wireless connections is practical, while the adopted techniques are widely used across the industry. There is limited indication of proprietary innovations. Overall, it sits around the industry-average technology level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Momentum 3 Wireless has a market price around 300 USD. With the Sony WH-CH720N offering similar core functionality at about 99 USD, the cost-performance ratio is approximately 0.33 when computed as 99 / 300. The WH-CH720N offers advantages including around 35 hours of battery life (versus about 17 hours on Momentum 3), dual noise sensor technology, Bluetooth 5.2, and 360 Reality Audio support. Both products share the same basic configuration as over-ear ANC headphones with roughly 30-42 mm drivers.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Sennheiser, established in 1945, maintains high reliability as a recognized audio brand. Products include a 2-year warranty and a global support structure. With the successor Momentum 4 Wireless introduced, the official focus has shifted to the newer model, and availability can vary by region and period with retail channels playing a major role. There is some uncertainty regarding long-term firmware support, while hardware durability and brand reliability remain strong.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design supporting both wired and wireless connections is rational for diverse usage scenarios. The 42 mm drivers and Bluetooth 5.0 provide stable connectivity, and ANC delivers sufficient day-to-day external noise reduction. There is room for improvement in distortion behavior and bass boost tendencies. Given the current market, more affordable products can offer similar functionality, limiting the technical advantage at the 300 USD price point.

## Advice

The Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless is difficult to recommend purely on measured performance versus price. With noted bass-centric distortion tendencies and the Sony WH-CH720N offering similar functionality at about one-third the price, it is often not the most rational choice. Users valuing the Sennheiser brand may still consider it, but evaluating the successor Momentum 4 Wireless or other current models is advisable. Support continuity can vary by region and period, so verify the latest status before purchase. For cost-performance, the WH-CH720N is a practical alternative; for sound quality, consider similarly priced competitors with stronger measured results.
