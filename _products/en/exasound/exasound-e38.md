## Overview

The ExaSound e38 is a high-end 8-channel DAC from Canadian manufacturer ExaSound Audio Design. It features the ES9038PRO chip, supports DSD256 playback, and incorporates proprietary ZeroJitter and GalvanicInfinity technologies. The company is known as a pioneer in multi-channel DSD, and the e38 has been selected as an A+ Recommended Component by Stereophile magazine. Both balanced and unbalanced output versions are available, with recommended pairing with the dedicated PlayPoint network streamer.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measurement performance, as verified by Stereophile magazine, is excellent. Figures such as a THD+N of 0.0004% and an S/N ratio of 123dB sufficiently meet the "audibly transparent" criteria defined in our review policy. The frequency response is also flat within the 20Hz-20kHz range, and there are no issues with crosstalk or dynamic range. Based purely on measurement data, the scientific validity is at a very high level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption and implementation of the ES9038PRO DAC chip exceeds industry standards. Technical approaches including parallelization of four internal DAC channels, quad clock configuration with 82 femtosecond master clock, and galvanic isolation technology are commendable. The proprietary ZeroJitter USB implementation and ZeroResolutionLoss volume control also show technical ingenuity. However, these technologies are primarily combinations of existing technologies rather than revolutionary proprietary designs. While above industry average, they do not reach the highest levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Against the 4300 USD price, functionally equivalent alternatives exist. For example, the Behringer UMC1820 (300 USD) and ESI Gigaport eX (160 EUR) offer the same 8-channel output as the e38, and their measurement performance (e.g., THD+N, SNR) sufficiently meets the "audibly transparent" criteria defined in our review policy. While the e38's superior measurements are technically excellent, they do not translate into meaningful differences in sound quality. Therefore, with products offering virtually identical audio quality available for a fraction of the price, the cost-performance must be rated as extremely poor. Based on the calculation: 300 USD ÷ 4300 USD ≈ 0.07, the score is 0.1.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

ExaSound has over 10 years of experience as a specialist manufacturer with few product failure reports and high stability levels. A 3-year product warranty is provided with continuous firmware update support. Despite being a small Canadian-based company, they maintain a highly specialized support system with good user community ratings. However, global service networks are limited, and convenience aspects like repair support lag behind major manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The development approach of pursuing measurement performance to meet the niche demand for multi-channel playback is rational. However, the lack of rationality lies in offering this solution as an expensive dedicated device. Even for users who require 8-channel output, combining a PC with a less expensive, high-performance multi-channel DAC can achieve equivalent or superior functionality at a lower cost and with greater flexibility. Considering the advantages of alternative general-purpose systems, this product's design philosophy cannot be considered the optimal solution.

## Advice

The e38 is an excellent product in terms of measurement performance, but its 4300 USD price is the biggest issue. Even for users with the specific need for 8-channel output, more affordable and flexible alternative setups (e.g., a PC + multi-channel DAC) exist. For pure 2-channel playback, it is obviously overkill, and products under 1000 USD can be expected to provide more than sufficient performance. Because more rational alternatives exist even for its specific intended use, an investment in this product is not recommended.
