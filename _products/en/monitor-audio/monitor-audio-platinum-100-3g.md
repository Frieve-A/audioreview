## Overview

The Platinum 100 3G is Monitor Audio’s flagship compact bookshelf in the Platinum Series 3G. It combines a MPD III high-frequency transducer with a 6-inch RDT III cone in a rear-ported, two-way cabinet, targeting high-fidelity listening from a small footprint [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, CTA-2034-style data for the Platinum 100 3G is not publicly available as of this date. We therefore rely on official specifications: free-field (-6 dB) 37 Hz–60 kHz, in-room (-6 dB) 28 Hz–60 kHz, sensitivity 85 dB (2.83 Vrms/1 m), nominal impedance 4 Ω, port tuning 44 Hz, crossover 2.85 kHz [1]. Monitor Audio positions MPD III/RDT III as distortion-reducing refinements versus prior generations, but quantitative third-party verification for this exact model has not yet surfaced [1][2]. Score remains a neutral baseline pending independent measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

MPD III (a micro-pleated diaphragm HF transducer) and the latest RDT III sandwich cone represent advanced materials engineering and acoustic design, with a focus on lowering distortion and flattening response. Cabinet execution and mechanical detailing are premium. Absent public third-party data for this exact model, we cap the score short of maximum while recognizing genuine design sophistication [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Review-target market price: 6,900 USD per pair (current US retail) [6].  
Cheapest equal-or-better measured alternative (bookshelf, equal/greater neutrality & low distortion with CTA-2034 data): **KEF R3 Meta**, 2,499.99 USD per pair [4][5].  
CP = 2,499.99 USD ÷ 6,900 USD = 0.3623… → **0.4** (rounded to one decimal).  
R3 Meta’s independent NFS/CTA-2034 results and low-distortion profile justify its use as the comparator [4]. The Platinum 100 3G’s build and finish exceed many rivals, but the measured-performance-per-USD is only moderate.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Monitor Audio provides a **5-year** speaker warranty and established global distribution/support. Materials and finish quality are high, and there are no widespread reliability flags in current public records. Lack of long-term field failure statistics prevents a higher score [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design pursues lower distortion and refined dispersion using MPD III and RDT III, which is a rational path. However, the focus on >20 kHz extension offers minimal audible benefit, and without transparent third-party data for this model, it is hard to prove commensurate performance gains over less-expensive, well-measured competitors [1][2][4].

## Advice

Choose the Platinum 100 3G if you prioritize luxury build, industrial design, and Monitor Audio’s house tech in a compact enclosure. Pair with a stable amplifier (sensitivity 85 dB, 4 Ω nominal) and consider sub integration for higher-level bass headroom. If your priority is the best independently measured neutrality per dollar, audition KEF R3 Meta; if you value premium cabinetry and finishing with credible engineering, the Platinum 100 3G remains compelling.
