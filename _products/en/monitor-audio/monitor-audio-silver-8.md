## Overview

The Monitor Audio Silver 8 is a three-way floorstanding speaker from the 5th-generation Silver series (2014–2015). US retail was just under 2000 USD/pair. It uses C-CAM (ceramic-coated aluminum-magnesium) drivers—dual 6" woofers, 4" midrange, and a 1" dome tweeter. Production has ended; used-market pricing typically ranges ~800–1350 USD/pair depending on finish and condition.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent lab data show neutral-leaning behavior with concrete figures. Measured voltage sensitivity is **88.5 dB/2.83 V/m** (spec 90 dB/W/m). Impedance is nominally 4 Ω with a **3.5 Ω** minimum at **165 Hz**; electrical phase is generally benign (≈**–34° at ~100 Hz with ~4.5 Ω**), so a competent 4-ohm-rated amplifier is recommended. Low-frequency extension is **≈40 Hz at –6 dB**, and the axial response is described as impressively even. Cabinet accelerometer tests show panel modes around **301 Hz** and **410 Hz** that “measure worse than they sound.” The 4" midrange employs an under-hung motor aimed at low distortion.

*Key numbers (measured):* 88.5 dB sensitivity; 3.5 Ω minimum; –6 dB ≈ 40 Hz.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

For its era the engineering is sound (C-CAM diaphragms, under-hung midrange, three-way network at **500 Hz** and **2.7 kHz**). Versus current designs it lacks modern features like built-in DSP/room correction or advanced modular cabinetry. As a 2015 passive design, it sits slightly below today’s median “technology level.”

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better confirmed):** **JBL Stage A180** floorstander. Third-party Klippel NFS data indicate neutral response with **frequency deviation ≈2.7 dB** (300 Hz–5 kHz), **F6 ≈ 41 Hz**, and **sensitivity ≈88.6 dB**, which is equivalent in user-visible performance (neutrality and bass reach) to the Silver 8’s independent data. Official US pricing shows **399.95 USD each** at JBL; **pair = 799.90 USD** (lower than the Silver 8’s representative 1000 USD/pair used price). Resulting CP = **0.8**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Discontinued models have no new-purchase factory warranty. Age-related risks include cosmetic wear and crossover component drift; parts/service depend on third parties. Build quality is robust but official support is absent.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A conventional, measurement-minded passive approach—rigid metal diaphragms plus under-hung mid—pursues low distortion and smooth directivity with established methods. Sensible and data-aware, but conservative relative to today’s DSP-assisted optimization trends.

## Advice

If you can source a clean pair near **1000 USD**, the Silver 8 remains a capable, neutral tower with genuine ~40 Hz reach. Use a 4-ohm-capable amplifier and check cabinets for loosened braces or panel buzz. If you prefer **new with warranty** and comparable measured neutrality at a lower price, shortlist **JBL Stage A180 (799.90 USD/pair)**.
