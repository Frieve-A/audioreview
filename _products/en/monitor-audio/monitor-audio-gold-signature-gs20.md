## Overview

The Monitor Audio Gold Signature GS20 is a discontinued 2.5-way floorstanding loudspeaker from the mid-2000s Gold Signature line. It uses two 6.5-inch RST (Rigid Surface Technology) C-CAM drivers (one bass, one bass-mid) and a 1-inch gold-anodized C-CAM dome tweeter with nominal crossovers around 250 Hz and 2.7 kHz in a slim reflex cabinet for full-range stereo use. [2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sound & Vision’s anechoic HT Labs Measures reports a listening-window response of **+1.63/–1.86 dB (200 Hz–10 kHz)**, with low-frequency extension at **–3 dB = 47 Hz** and **–6 dB = 41 Hz**; minimum impedance **5.29 Ω @ 172 Hz**, phase **–41.44° @ 86 Hz** [1]. These indicate well-controlled on/near-axis behavior and useful bass reach for a compact tower. Independent wideband distortion datasets remain scarce, so transparency beyond response/extension cannot be fully quantified.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The GS20 showcases Monitor Audio’s mid-2000s metal-cone platform (C-CAM dome, RST-profile cones, robust cabinetry). However, it lacks contemporary advances such as waveguide-optimized directivity paired with DSP/active crossovers that enable tighter response shaping and room-friendly behavior in current designs. As a purely passive 2.5-way, its sophistication is respectable for its era but not state of the art today.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Original MSRP was **3,000 USD**. Among current, widely measured towers, **Polk Reserve R700** (**1,099 USD each; 2,198 USD/pair** on the official store) is the lowest-priced model we find that meets an “equal-or-better for users” bar on core metrics: floorstanding form factor, **F3 ≈ 40 Hz** (R700) vs **47 Hz** (GS20), and midband linearity about **±2 dB** from CTA-2034 data (note the GS20’s window is S&V listening-window 200 Hz–10 kHz, while R700 stats are spin-derived/CTA-2034). Linearity is effectively equivalent within tolerance and the R700’s extension is deeper.  
**CP calculation:** `2,198 USD ÷ 3,000 USD = 0.73` → **0.7**. [1][3][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The GS20 is discontinued and listed under **Monitor Audio Heritage**; support/parts are limited to legacy assistance and dealer channels. Passive topology avoids firmware concerns, but specialized metal-cone parts may be costly to replace. [5]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

While premium materials/mechanics are emphasized, the GS20’s passive architecture does not leverage modern control (DSP/active) that measurably tightens response/directivity for listeners. Relative to what is achievable today at far lower cost, the design direction prioritizes materials/cosmetics over measurable gains in audibility-relevant performance.

## Advice

If shopping new, prioritize models with published CTA-2034 data offering deeper extension and controlled directivity at lower prices. As a concrete baseline, the **Polk Reserve R700** delivers equal-or-better user-facing performance on extension and effectively equivalent midband linearity at **2,198 USD/pair**. If you specifically prefer Monitor Audio, consider current series with updated engineering rather than paying near-MSRP for GS20. [3][4]
