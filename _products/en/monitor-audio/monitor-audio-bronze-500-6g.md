## Overview

Bronze 500 6G is a 2.5-way floorstander with a 1" C-CAM gold-dome tweeter (UD waveguide) and dual 8" C-CAM mid-bass drivers in a rear-ported enclosure. Major retailers list manufacturer-aligned specs of **41 Hz–25 kHz (-6 dB, free-field) / 32 Hz–30 kHz (in-room)**, **90 dB (2.83 V/1 m)**, **8 Ω nominal** [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As of **Aug 24, 2025**, we could not locate a credible standardized third-party anechoic set (full on-axis FR window with tolerances, THD/IMD vs SPL, CTA-2034 spin, etc.) for Bronze 500 6G. We therefore start from 0.5 and add +0.1 for clear, consistent manufacturer specs reported by reputable retailers, explicitly labeled as such here [1][2]. Independent lab data would revise this score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

C-CAM diaphragms, the UD waveguide, DCM treatment, and HiVe II ports are competent, well-understood choices for a passive 2.5-way tower. The approach is evolutionary (no onboard DSP/room correction or step-change in verified transparency), so we keep this at 0.6 [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Reference price: **USD 1,495/pair** for Bronze 500 6G [3].  
Cheapest equal-or-better alternative verified today: **Klipsch RP-8000F II** (dual 8", spec FR **35–25 kHz ±3 dB**; independently measured sensitivity **≈92.2 dB anechoic**), available as a **pair bundle** at **USD 799.99/pair** [4][5].  
**Calculation (USD):** 799.99 ÷ 1495 = **0.535** → **0.5** (1 decimal).  
Equivalence note: same passive floorstanding function; equal-or-better user-facing axes (achievable SPL via sensitivity; bass reach by spec tolerance) with independent sensitivity data to substantiate [4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Retailer product pages indicate **5-year** warranty for the hi-fi speaker line, which exceeds the common 2–3 year baseline. Passive architecture reduces electronic failure points, but public failure-rate datasets are scarce; we assign a conservative 0.7 [1][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Within today’s measurement-forward landscape, Bronze 500 6G remains a conventional passive design without published third-party verification showing step-change gains in audibility-relevant metrics. The direction is competent but conservative.

## Advice

- **Large rooms / higher SPL:** 90 dB sensitivity and cabinet volume help; allow wall clearance and toe-in to manage early reflections.  
- **Measurement-first buyers:** If independently published data are required, shortlist alternatives with robust lab results (e.g., RP-8000F II) [4].  
- **Warranty-minded:** Expect 5-year coverage via authorized channels; retain proof/registration per seller guidance [1][2].
