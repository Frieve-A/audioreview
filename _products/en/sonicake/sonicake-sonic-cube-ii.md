## Overview

Sonicake Sonic Cube II (QAI-22) is a 2-channel USB audio interface released in 2025. Market price is around 69 USD (8,800円 in JP), and the manufacturer lists 24bit/48kHz support, +48V phantom power, and built-in digital modeling [1][2]. It connects via USB Type-C to Windows/Mac; MIC 1 is a combo jack (max gain 50dB), LINE/INST 2 is 6.35mm TRS (-25dB to +25dB gain), 320g, 143.5×95.8×43.5mm [1][2]. A third-party review also reports 16-bit fixed operation, implying some ambiguity in practical behavior [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While the manufacturer lists 24bit/48kHz support [1][2], there are no disclosed measurements for SNR, THD/THD+N, IMD, frequency response, crosstalk, or dynamic range. A third-party review reports 16-bit fixed operation in practice [3]. Without independent lab data, audible transparency cannot be substantiated at this time.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

It integrates modeling and DSP, but ADC/DAC, preamp topology, and DSP algorithm details are undisclosed [1]. The generic USB 2.0 Type-C design and lack of objective superiority data indicate an average technical level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Given the required set (two inputs, +48V phantom, 24bit capability, HP/line outs) [1][2], current JP market shows this model at the world's lowest tier price for equivalent-or-better features. Therefore CP = 1.0 by definition (world’s cheapest tier; no formula display needed). Note M-Audio M-Track Solo/Duo are 16-bit according to manufacturer specs and thus not equivalent for this comparison [3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Sonicake is relatively new; long-term field reliability data and MTBF are not published. Warranty/support details and regional coverage are not clearly documented, and Windows setup complexity reports exist [3]. Thus reliability is rated low.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Low-cost and feature-rich aims are clear, but the lack of measurements weakens scientific grounding, and the 48kHz ceiling is conservative against 192kHz-capable entry models. Modeling differentiates the product, yet validation transparency is limited; hence a low rationality score [1][3].

## Advice

As independent measurements are scarce, those prioritizing verifiable performance should compare with models that have published lab data. Modeling can be replaced by free plugins, so prioritize interfaces with transparent specifications and measurements. Sonic Cube II remains a valid low-cost option when you need basic I/O with +48V at minimum cost [1][2].
