## Overview

The Eclipse TD508MK4 is an 8cm full-range speaker system from the Eclipse brand, developed by Denso Ten. It adopts the company's distinctive egg-shaped cabinet "Time Domain" design, inheriting a design philosophy that emphasizes the temporal reproduction of sound sources through a single-driver construction. As an improved model over the previous TD508MK3, it features an approximately 400cc increased internal volume to reduce back pressure and extend the frequency range. The use of a glass fiber diaphragm achieves both lightness and rigidity.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The single-driver design is scientifically valid in that it, in principle, eliminates phase distortion caused by crossover circuits, which are unavoidable in multi-way speakers. However, an 8cm full-range driver faces severe physical constraints regarding low-frequency reproduction capability, high-frequency extension, and overall distortion. The low-frequency capability is particularly limited, making it difficult to achieve transparent levels in measurement data. Modern DSP-equipped active speakers can achieve an equivalent or better impulse response (phase characteristics) and a flatter frequency response simultaneously through digital signal processing, rendering the scientific advantage of this unit limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The individual technologies employed, such as the glass fiber diaphragm, egg-shaped cabinet, and powerful magnetic circuit, are well-established and acoustically sound approaches. Eclipse has refined these existing technologies with its proprietary know-how. However, the essence of the technology remains within the realm of mechanical and acoustic methods. Compared to modern DSP technology, which overcomes the physical limitations of drivers through digital signal processing to achieve higher performance on multiple fronts, it lacks innovation and does not reach the industry's cutting edge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The current retail price of the TD508MK4 is 898 USD per pair. Numerous products with superior overall performance exist in this price range. For example, the Kali Audio LP-6 V2 (around 400 USD per pair) is a DSP-equipped active speaker with a built-in amplifier. It boasts a flatter frequency response and lower distortion in measurements, and its time-domain response is also excellent due to DSP correction. Considering that no separate amplifier is needed, it offers superior performance for less than half the total cost.
Calculation: 400 USD ÷ 898 USD ≈ 0.45.
Therefore, the cost-performance is rated as very low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Denso Ten has a quality control system cultivated as a major automotive parts manufacturer, ensuring a high standard of product reliability. The single-driver configuration reduces failure points and offers excellent long-term stability. While warranty and repair systems are comprehensive within Japan, limited overseas expansion restricts international support. Eclipse products have limited production volumes, raising concerns about future parts supply. Although reliability is above the industry average, regional limitations on support constrain the evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The philosophy of prioritizing temporal accuracy and pursuing a point source with a single driver is theoretically rational. However, it makes significant sacrifices in other critical performance areas, such as frequency range and distortion. Today, DSP technology makes it possible to achieve a high level of performance across all metrics. Persisting with a physically limited approach that results in a high-priced, limited-performance product is markedly irrational in an era where superior alternatives exist.

## Advice

The TD508MK4 is a niche product for users who find strong value in its unique design philosophy and specific acoustic characteristics. However, we strongly recommend auditioning modern high-performance active speakers before paying over 867 USD for a pair. For example, the Kali Audio LP-6 V2 (around 400 USD per pair) or the Genelec 8020D (around 867 USD per pair) offer performance that surpasses this unit in every objective metric at an equivalent or lower total cost. Except for limited use cases like low-volume desktop listening, you should consider more rational and higher-performing options.
