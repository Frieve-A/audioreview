## Overview

The Eclipse TD508MK3 is a compact bookshelf speaker featuring an 8cm full-range driver, developed by the audio brand "Eclipse" from Denso Ten (formerly Fujitsu Ten). It is currently discontinued. The product's key feature is its pursuit of an extremely accurate impulse response (the reproducibility of sound in the time domain) through point-source reproduction that eliminates a crossover network and an egg-shaped cabinet that suppresses internal standing waves. The original retail price was 440 USD per unit.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The product's strength, its excellent impulse response, contributes to temporally accurate sound reproduction. However, this comes at the cost of sacrificing frequency response (especially low and high-frequency extension), harmonic distortion, and dynamic range due to the physical limitations of a single 8cm driver. The nominal specs of 52Hz-27kHz (-10dB) and a low efficiency of 82dB/W·m demonstrate these limits. Modern DSP-equipped active speakers achieve equivalent or superior impulse response through precise phase correction using FIR filters, while also correcting for a flat frequency response, thus far surpassing this unit in overall scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of a full-range single driver that eliminates the need for a crossover, and the egg-shaped cabinet that suppresses internal standing waves and diffraction, are acoustically rational approaches to achieving an excellent impulse response. However, this mechanical and acoustic method cannot overcome the driver's own physical limitations (breakup, Doppler distortion, narrow playback band). In contrast, modern DSP technology can achieve both excellent time and frequency response without relying on the physically limited full-range method by individually correcting phase and frequency characteristics in the digital domain, making it a more advanced approach in terms of technological potential.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Priced at 880 USD for a pair at the time of release, this unit faces competition from DSP-equipped active speakers like the IK Multimedia iLoud Micro Monitor (around 333 USD per pair). These products achieve both an excellent impulse response (time characteristic) equivalent to or better than this unit and a flatter frequency response, thanks to the time alignment processing performed by their built-in DSP. Furthermore, since they are active speakers with built-in amplifiers, they deliver superior performance in all aspects without any additional investment.
Calculation: 333 USD ÷ 880 USD ≈ 0.38.
Therefore, the cost-performance must be rated as extremely low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The developer, Denso Ten (formerly Fujitsu Ten), is a major Japanese manufacturer with a strong track record in the car audio field, so the basic reliability of the product can be expected. Additionally, passive speakers have a simple structure, which keeps the risk of failure low. The single-driver design is also advantageous from a reliability perspective due to fewer components. However, the company's home audio business focuses on a niche high-end market and is not large in scale, which raises slight concerns about long-term support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design philosophy that prioritizes temporal accuracy (impulse response) is extremely important for sound reproduction, and the dedication to pursuing this single point is rational. However, adhering to the physically limited method of a full-range driver to achieve this goal lacks rationality from a modern perspective. More cost-effective and high-performance DSP technology has made it possible to achieve equivalent or better time response without sacrificing other important factors like frequency response and distortion, making this unit's design approach increasingly obsolete.

## Advice

While this speaker offers attractive, precise sound imaging due to its excellent impulse response, careful consideration is needed to determine if it's worth paying 267 to 533 USD for a pair on the used market. More modern options with superior overall performance exist in the same price range. Specifically, we strongly recommend DSP-equipped active speakers like the IK Multimedia iLoud Micro Monitor (around 333 USD per pair) or the Genelec 8010A (around 533 USD per pair). These models use DSP to achieve performance comparable to this unit's strength in impulse response while overcoming its weaknesses in frequency response and distortion.
