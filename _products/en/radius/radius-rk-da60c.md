## Overview

The RK-DA60C is a 6-gram USB-C dongle DAC/amp targeting smartphone users who want a simple fidelity bump. It supports up to 32-bit/384 kHz PCM and, per Radius, employs one DAC per channel plus a Class-G headphone amplifier for efficiency[1][6]. The model launched in 2021 and received a VGP 2022 award in the “Portable headphone amp (under 10k-yen)” class[2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Comprehensive third-party measurements are limited; we therefore baseline to manufacturer device specs. Key numbers: frequency response 20 Hz–160 kHz (fs=384 kHz), THD+N ≤0.001% (fs=192 kHz, 16 Ω), S/N 130 dB (A-weighted, 16 Ω), and maximum output 1.0 Vrms (16 Ω)[1]. While these meet transparency targets in principle, the 1.0 Vrms ceiling can under-drive higher-impedance/low-sensitivity headphones. We will update this section if solid independent lab data becomes available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A compact CX31993 single-chip DAC/amp prioritizing portability over maximal output. Radius describes dual-channel DAC allocation and Class-G amplification for power efficiency[1][6]. Compared to recent dongles, there is no balanced out or high-power stage; implementation is competent but not cutting-edge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better)**: FiiO KA11—same 32-bit/384 kHz support, 3.5 mm out, and stronger published performance (SNR ≥125 dB, THD+N <0.0006% at 32 Ω; ≥200 mW @32 Ω / ≥245 mW @16 Ω)[3][4].  
**Prices**: RK-DA60C ≈ **59 USD** (converted from Radius JP list 9,130円)[1]. KA11 **29.99 USD**[5].  
**Calculation**: `29.99 USD ÷ 59 USD = 0.508` → rounds to **0.5**. Thus KA11 is the lowest-price equal-or-better option today.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Warranty is **1 year** per Radius store policy and retailer listings[1][8]. The simple, few-parts construction is a positive, but the ultra-small form factor may be more vulnerable to cable/connector stress. Global support coverage outside Japan is limited; long-term failure-rate data is not yet available.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Prioritizing extreme portability and low power aligns with a genuine user need, but the trade-off is modest output and feature simplicity. Given readily available dongles that provide materially higher output at lower prices, the design rationale skews toward convenience over measurable sonic headroom.

## Advice

If you exclusively use efficient IEMs and want the lightest possible dongle, this is serviceable. For broader headphone pairing and value, the KA11 (or similar high-output dongles) will generally be the better choice[3][4].
