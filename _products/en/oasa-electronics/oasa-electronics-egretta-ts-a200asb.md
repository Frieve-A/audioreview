## Overview

OASA Electronics Co., Ltd. is a Hiroshima-based electronics manufacturer that launched its own brand in 2011, leveraging over 20 years of OEM experience. The Egretta TS-A200asB is its flagship omnidirectional active speaker, characterized by its 360-degree sound radiation. Housed in a compact cylindrical enclosure approximately 26 cm tall, it employs a 3-way system featuring a Heil-type tweeter, a dome midrange, and an actuator vibration unit. The built-in amplifier provides 18W+18W of power, and it is equipped with various input terminals.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Egretta TS-A200asB's stated frequency response of 80Hz-45kHz is severely lacking, particularly in the sub-80Hz range crucial for foundational music reproduction, falling significantly short of the transparent level (20Hz-20kHz ±0.5dB). The omnidirectional design inherently makes precise stereo imaging difficult and can lead to undesirable acoustic artifacts from room reflections in typical listening environments. The 18W+18W power output is also limited for ensuring adequate dynamic range. While a full assessment is difficult as detailed measurements for THD, SNR, and crosstalk from independent third-party sources are not publicly available, the existing information suggests that multiple key performance metrics do not meet the transparent level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This product incorporates unique technological elements, such as proprietary materials like polymer clay composite film and lignin-containing carbon FRP diaphragms, alongside an active horn structure using an actuator. However, the use of a Heil-type tweeter and dome drivers are standard industry practices. The specifications of the 3-way configuration and the built-in amplifier (18W+18W) remain within the realm of combining existing technologies. While the omnidirectional acoustic design itself is distinctive, it does not represent an acoustic engineering breakthrough, leading to a technology level evaluation below the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Egretta TS-A200asB is priced at 1307 USD for a stereo pair. For a fair cost-performance evaluation, it is appropriate to compare it with another stereo pair of "omnidirectional active speakers." The most compelling competitor under this condition is a stereo pair of Amazon Echo Studio speakers (market price for two is approx. 400 USD). An Echo Studio pair offers superior low-frequency extension, a much more powerful amplifier, and the extensive functionality of smart speakers. The calculation is 400 USD ÷ 1307 USD ≈ 0.306. Given that a superior alternative exists in key acoustic performance and functionality at roughly one-third of the price, the cost-performance is rated as low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

OASA Electronics has a track record as an OEM manufacturer for over 20 years, suggesting a certain level of manufacturing quality. However, its history as an independent audio brand is relatively short, dating back to 2011. Compared to global audio specialists like KEF or Bose, it may lag in terms of long-term product reliability data and comprehensive support systems. The robust support expected for a high-priced product like this is unlikely to be at the top industry level, resulting in an evaluation slightly below the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design philosophy of an omnidirectional speaker, which fills a space with sound without a specific listening sweet spot, holds a certain rationality for specific use cases like background music or reducing listening fatigue over long periods. The technical approach of using proprietary materials to improve sound quality is also commendable. However, from the perspective of high-fidelity music reproduction, a design that cannot reproduce frequencies below 80Hz is not rational. Furthermore, considering that a stereo pair of Amazon Echo Studio speakers achieves equivalent or superior omnidirectional performance and features at a much lower price, the rationale for this product to exist as a dedicated audio device at 1307 USD is weak.

## Advice

We cannot recommend the purchase of the Egretta TS-A200asB. It offers no objective performance advantages to justify its 1307 USD price tag.

-   **If you want an omnidirectional stereo experience**: A stereo pair of Amazon Echo Studio speakers (approx. 400 USD for two) provides a far superior value proposition with its wider frequency response, higher power output, and extensive smart features.
-   **If you prioritize high-quality sound for your desktop and omnidirectional is not a must**: Conventional directional active speakers, such as the KEF LSX II LT (approx. 999.99 USD), offer a more satisfying experience with precise stereo imaging, excellent frequency response, and comprehensive connectivity.

When selecting audio equipment, we strongly advise prioritizing objective acoustic performance and cost-effectiveness, backed by measurement data, over unique design philosophies or brand image.
