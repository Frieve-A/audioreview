## Overview

The ESI Planet 22x is a 2-input 2-output audio interface that combines Dante protocol-based network audio technology with high-quality desktop recording capabilities. Supporting 24bit/96kHz, it achieves 118dB(a) dynamic range for AD converters and 123dB(a) dynamic range for DA converters. It features two XLR/phone combo inputs, balanced outputs, headphone amplifier, and Power over Ethernet (PoE) support. The product is positioned as a specialized device designed for use in Dante network environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AD converter's 118dB(a) and DA converter's 123dB(a) dynamic range exceed the transparency level (105dB or higher) from our reference standards. Basic performance including frequency response (20Hz-20kHz), S/N ratio, and crosstalk also achieve levels above industry standards. However, user reviews report noise issues and PCB implementation quality problems. Considering these reports, there appears to be a discrepancy between theoretical specifications and actual performance in real-world usage environments, preventing it from reaching full transparency levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The implementation of Dante networking technology is technically advanced, adopting industry-standard IP audio protocols in a progressive design. Features like PoE support, network-based audio transmission, and compatibility with existing Dante equipment demonstrate technical capabilities for modern audio system integration. However, the core audio conversion chipsets and circuit design lack originality, remaining within existing technology combinations. While software integration with Dante Controller is commendable, the overall technology level is only slightly above industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Compared to the Focusrite RedNet X2P (1426 USD) with equivalent Dante functionality, the Planet 22x (462 USD) is significantly cheaper. As a 2-input 2-output Dante-capable interface, the Planet 22x holds strong price advantages, achieving a cost-performance ratio of 1.0 since it represents one of the more affordable options in its category. The RedNet X2P offers Red Evolution mic preamps and higher reliability, but in terms of pure performance-to-price ratio for the provided functionality, the Planet 22x excels. It is a reasonable choice for applications requiring Dante functionality, though it may represent excessive specifications for general USB recording purposes.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

User reviews indicate PCB implementation quality issues and noise-related defect reports. ESI is a relatively small manufacturer, raising concerns about support systems and repair response compared to major brands. Product warranty is standard, but information regarding technical support expertise and response speed for Dante functionality is limited. While PoE capability is commendable, overall reliability remains at industry average levels, with long-term usage confidence inferior to major brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The adoption of Dante networking represents a rational approach to modernizing audio systems. Design philosophy pursuing departure from traditional analog connections through IP-based audio transmission, PoE power, and utilization of existing network infrastructure is commendable. However, Dante functionality represents excessive specifications for general users, with low necessity for specialized equipment in applications where USB connection suffices. Since equivalent or superior functionality can be achieved with general-purpose PCs plus affordable USB interfaces, the product's existence value is limited to specific professional environments. While scientific evidence for audio quality improvement is clear, there are irrational aspects from a cost-efficiency perspective.

## Advice

The ESI Planet 22x is recommended for specialized users who need integration into existing Dante network environments, as it offers strong cost-performance for such applications. For general music production, podcasting, and streaming, selecting standard USB-connected audio interfaces will achieve superior audio quality at lower prices. When there is clear need for Dante functionality, it provides better value than more expensive options like the Focusrite RedNet X2P. For home studio use, factors including network configuration complexity, required specialized knowledge, and noise issues reported by some users should be considered. It is a strong option when Dante functionality is needed on a budget, but we strongly recommend careful consideration of whether Dante networking is truly necessary before purchase.
