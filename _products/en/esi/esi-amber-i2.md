## Overview

The ESI Amber i2 is a 24-bit/192kHz USB-C audio interface designed for musicians, producers, and content creators. Featuring 2 inputs and 2 outputs, it includes Class-A microphone preamps, Hi-Z guitar inputs, and ESI's proprietary Advanced Direct Monitoring (ADM) system. The interface targets the budget-conscious professional market with a claimed dynamic range of 115 dB and comprehensive connectivity options including MIDI I/O. Its metal construction and compact form factor make it suitable for both studio and mobile recording applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The ESI Amber i2 claims a dynamic range of 115 dB A from manufacturer specifications [1], which exceeds the transparent level threshold (105 dB). However, comprehensive web-based fact-checking reveals no independent third-party measurements available for critical parameters including THD, SNR, frequency response, or crosstalk from credible measurement sources such as Audio Science Review or independent testing laboratories. Following conservative evaluation principles required when relying solely on manufacturer specifications without independent verification, the score remains at the baseline average between problematic and transparent levels. The claimed 115dB dynamic range, if verified, would merit higher scoring, but manufacturer specifications receive conservative treatment pending independent measurement validation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The interface incorporates Advanced Direct Monitoring (ADM) system providing real-time zero-latency monitoring, representing a technical differentiator in the budget interface category. USB-C connectivity and comprehensive driver support (ASIO 2.0, MME, WDM, DirectSound) demonstrate contemporary technology adoption. Class-A microphone preamps represent standard technology for the category. The ADM feature provides functionality that competitors typically lack at this price point, justifying the above-average technology score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The ESI Amber i2 is priced at 177 USD [2]. The Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 4th Generation at 135 USD [3] provides equivalent-or-better functionality with 2x2 configuration, 24-bit/192kHz support, professional preamps, and superior 120dB dynamic range versus the ESI's claimed 115dB specification. The Focusrite lacks bidirectional MIDI I/O, but this functional gap can be bridged with a basic USB MIDI interface (approximately 20-40 USD for bidirectional MIDI I/O capability), bringing the total equivalent functionality cost to approximately 155-175 USD. Using the lower-cost equivalent combination of 155 USD for true functional equivalence: CP = 155 ÷ 177 = 0.88 → 0.9. However, considering the standalone Focusrite as the closest single-unit comparator: CP = 135 ÷ 177 = 0.76 → 0.8.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ESI provides comprehensive 2-year warranty with 3-year extension through product registration [4]. The company maintains 24/7 support infrastructure with teams in Germany and the US, with established operations since 1998 [5]. Metal housing construction with USB-C bus power represents robust, simple design resistant to failure. However, user feedback reveals mixed experiences including reports of audio glitches requiring USB reconnection in some units [4]. The company's German engineering background and established support infrastructure provide confidence in long-term availability, though reliability concerns prevent higher scoring.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

ESI demonstrates rational engineering focused on delivering professional features at accessible price points. The design philosophy emphasizes measured specifications and performance-oriented features including 24-bit/192kHz support and comprehensive connectivity. Advanced Direct Monitoring technology shows technical innovation contributing to functionality. Modern USB-C adoption and comprehensive driver compatibility reflect contemporary design thinking. The compact metal form factor balances durability with portability requirements. Cost optimization is evident through direct monitoring and MIDI I/O integration at competitive pricing.

## Advice

The ESI Amber i2 offers a comprehensive feature set at 177 USD, combining Class-A preamps, claimed 115dB dynamic range, Advanced Direct Monitoring, and bidirectional MIDI I/O. However, without independent third-party measurement verification, the claimed specifications remain unconfirmed. The Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 4th Generation at 135 USD provides superior value with independently verified 120dB dynamic range, proven reliability, and comprehensive feature set. For users requiring bidirectional MIDI I/O, adding a basic USB MIDI interface (20-40 USD) achieves equivalent functionality at 155-175 USD total cost. Users specifically requiring integrated MIDI I/O and Advanced Direct Monitoring in a single unit may consider the ESI, but those prioritizing verified performance and cost-effectiveness should choose the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 4th Generation as the primary recommendation.
