## Overview

The Amber i4 is a **24-bit/192 kHz** USB-C desktop interface providing **4×4 analog I/O**, **two Class-A mic preamps**, **independent 48 V phantom power**, **two auto-detect bidirectional MIDI ports**, and **dual headphone monitoring via OUTPUT A/B selection** on the front panel [1][2]. Its **LCD** shows level meters and mode status, and the large **amber main encoder** controls the selected output bus. ESI’s **ADM (Advanced Direct Monitoring)** enables **latency-free hardware mixes** directly on the unit or from the **Amber i4 Control** app, with **virtual channels & loopback** for streaming/recording computer audio [1][2]. The unit is **USB class-compliant** (CoreAudio on macOS/iOS) and offers **EWDM ASIO** drivers for Windows (ASIO 2.0 / WDM / MME / DirectSound) [2]. The package includes **Bitwig Studio 8-Track**, **Steinberg WaveLab LE**, and **Cubasis LE** registration, plus both **USB-C↔C** and **USB-A↔C** cables in the box [2]. ESI publishes **115 dB(A) dynamic range** for D/A (and 115 dB(A) class for the converters overall) [1][2].

### Connections & Controls (from manual)

- **Front:** 2× **XLR/TRS combo** inputs (Mic/Line/Hi-Z), per-input **GAIN**, **48 V** switches, LCD, **SELECT / MONITORING / MIX / OUTPUT A/B** keys, **main encoder** [2].  
- **Rear:** **LINE OUT A (1/2) & B (3/4)** TRS, **MIDI IN/OUT 1–2** (each **bidirectional**; can be configured as IN or OUT), **USB-C**, **Power switch**, optional **5 V DC** input [2].  
- **Software:** Amber i4 Control with **firmware update**, **sample-rate** and **device settings**, **ADM mixer**, and loopback routing. A third “**DAW-Control**” MIDI port is reserved for hardware–software comms and should be disabled in DAWs [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

There are **no independent laboratory measurements** for Amber i4’s converters/preamps at this time. ESI’s documentation provides concrete figures—**115 dB(A) DR** and low THD+N—which, **if achieved**, reach transparent performance targets for typical music production [1][2]. Per our scoring method when independent data are missing, we start at **0.5** and adjust slightly for **specific, consistent manufacturer metrics**, resulting in **0.6**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Feature set is contemporary: **24-bit/192 kHz**, **Class-A pres**, **ADM hardware mixing**, **virtual channels/loopback**, **bidirectional MIDI**, **dual-bus headphone monitoring**, and **class-compliant** operation with dedicated Windows drivers [1][2]. The manual and product page **do not disclose converter chipset models or special proprietary DSP** beyond ADM; thus we consider the implementation technically solid but not uniquely innovative.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Typical street price is **≈ 240 USD** for Amber i4 [5][1]. For comparison against the **cheapest product with equal or better verified measurement performance**, the **MOTU M4** is a well-measured 4×4 interface with independently reported **≈120 dB** output dynamic range and excellent loopback results [3]. In the US, M4 commonly sells for **269.95 USD** at major retailers [4][6]. We did not find a **cheaper** interface with **independent measurements** meeting or exceeding the Amber i4’s **115 dB(A)** class published spec. Therefore, Amber i4 is currently the **lowest-cost option at this performance tier**, earning **1.0**.

**Anchor comparison**  
- **Amber i4** — ~240 USD, published **115 dB(A)** DR, ADM/loopback, bidirectional MIDI [1][2][5].  
- **MOTU M4** — **269.95 USD**, independent measurements **≈120 dB** DR, widely validated performance [3][4][6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ESI offers standard warranty and actively maintains **drivers/firmware** via the Amber i4 Control app; documentation notes firmware update prompts and platform support (Windows 10/11; macOS 10.13+ incl. Apple Silicon) [2]. A knowledge-base entry clarifies **single-unit per computer** usage for Amber series (i1/i2/i4) [7]. With no public MTBF/failure-rate datasets and a smaller global service network than tier-one brands, we assess reliability/support as **average**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design prioritizes **transparent capture**, **hands-on monitoring** (ADM), **streaming-oriented loopback**, and **MIDI flexibility** (two auto-detect ports) in a small, bus-powered chassis with **dual output buses** for control-room/headphone workflows—an internally consistent, practical focus for creators on a budget [1][2].

## Advice

If you want a **budget 4×4** with **dual-bus monitoring**, **loopback**, and **MIDI** that integrates cleanly on Windows/macOS/iOS, Amber i4 is compelling. If you require **independently verified top-tier measurements**, the **MOTU M4** remains the safe benchmark—at a higher price [3][4][6]. For cost-sensitive buyers comfortable with **manufacturer-published specs**, Amber i4 offers **excellent value**.
