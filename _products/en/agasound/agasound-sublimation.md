## Overview

The Agasound Sublimation is an in-ear monitor featuring a 10mm dynamic driver with ceramic-coated diaphragm technology. Manufactured by Guangzhou Aga Audio Technology Co., Ltd in Guangdong, China, this IEM emphasizes precision manufacturing with metal housing construction. Priced at 115 USD, it targets the mid-range IEM market with claims of reduced harmonic distortion through ceramic coating technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Sublimation provides basic specifications but lacks critical measurement data for proper scientific evaluation. Available specifications include frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz meeting standard IEM range and sensitivity of 128dB exceeding excellent threshold for headphones/earphones [1]. However, crucial performance metrics including THD, impedance, S/N ratio, and crosstalk remain unavailable from credible third-party sources. The ceramic-coated diaphragm claims distortion reduction benefits but no independent measurement data confirms this. Without credible third-party measurements, scientific validity cannot be properly evaluated and is set to 0.5 due to insufficient data for assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Sublimation incorporates several advanced manufacturing techniques including N52 magnetic design, ceramic-coated diaphragm technology, and 5-axis CNC machining for aluminum housing construction. These demonstrate competent engineering execution and precision manufacturing capabilities. However, the technologies represent established rather than cutting-edge innovations. The single dynamic driver configuration and standard connectivity options remain conventional approaches without significant technical differentiation from competitors.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Current market price is 115 USD. The cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative with confirmed specs is 7Hz Salnotes Zero at 25 USD [2], offering equivalent user-facing functions (wired IEM, detachable cable) and credible specifications (10–20kHz range, 108dB/V sensitivity, THD <1% @1kHz). CP = 25 USD ÷ 115 USD = 0.2.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The aerospace-grade aluminum construction and simple single-driver design suggest good inherent reliability with fewer potential failure points. Agasound provides some track record in the audio industry with robust materials and straightforward engineering approach indicating durability. However, global support infrastructure remains limited with dealer-based support system and unknown failure rate data affecting overall reliability assessment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design philosophy emphasizes engineering solutions including ceramic coating for claimed distortion reduction and precision manufacturing techniques. Material usage serves functional durability purposes rather than purely aesthetic considerations. The approach focuses on practical improvements over subjective claims. However, the design lacks innovation in areas such as DSP integration or advanced driver technologies, maintaining traditional dynamic driver approach without significant differentiation from competitors. The pricing strategy appears disconnected from functional value delivery compared to alternatives.

## Advice

The Agasound Sublimation represents competent engineering with quality construction materials and reasonable design philosophy. However, potential purchasers should consider the poor cost-performance compared to equivalent alternatives with proven measurement data. The Moondrop Aria 2 (89 USD) provides superior measured performance including THD ≤0.05% at lower cost than the Sublimation, with verified third-party measurements confirming excellent technical performance. Unless specific requirement exists for Agasound's particular aesthetic design or ceramic coating technology, the Aria 2 provides better value proposition for achieving superior audio performance.
