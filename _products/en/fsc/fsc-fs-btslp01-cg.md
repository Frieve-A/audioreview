summary: "A discontinued sleep-oriented Bluetooth 5.0 neckband earphone in camouflage green. Retailer-listed specs indicate ~10 h playback, ~2 h charge via micro-USB, 20 g mass, and sales end in Japan. With no public third-party acoustic measurements, we evaluate scientific validity from a neutral baseline and confirm cheaper, measured alternatives exist."

## Overview

FS-BTSLP01-CG is a compact neckband Bluetooth earphone marketed for side-sleep comfort. Retailer-listed specifications state Bluetooth 5.0, codec support (SBC/AAC/aptX/LDAC), approximately **10 hours** playback, **~2 hours** charging over **micro-USB**, and **20 g** weight. The listing also marks the item as **sales ended** with a last observed price of **2,980円**, used here as the basis for a **20 USD** denominator via same-day official conversion. These are catalog (retailer) specs; no official product page with detailed measurements was located as of this date [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No independent lab measurements (frequency response, THD, S/N, isolation, ANC) were found for this model. In line with a measurement-first stance, we take a neutral baseline when performance is unknown and limit claims to catalog facts (Bluetooth 5.0, codecs, battery/charging) clearly labeled as retailer-provided [1]. Until controlled data appears, scientific conclusions about fidelity cannot be drawn beyond functionality confirmation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The platform appears commodity-grade: Bluetooth 5.0, **micro-USB** charging, no documented app-based tuning, no ANC, and no advertised adaptive features. Absent verifiable engineering differentiators or published acoustic design data, technological sophistication is judged low from a 2025 perspective [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **JLab GO Air POP**. It provides equivalent user functions (stereo Bluetooth playback with integrated mic) and has public third-party measurements documenting performance, e.g., treble accuracy standard error **3.46 dB** and comprehensive isolation/latency results [2]. A widely available US retail price of **19.99 USD** is confirmed at Best Buy [3].

**Calculation (USD basis):** **19.99 USD ÷ 20 USD = 1.00** → **1.0** (rounded to one decimal). Because an equal-or-better, essentially equally priced measured alternative exists, CP rounds to 1.0 while the body discloses the underlying division.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The product is confirmed **discontinued** at the retailer listing, and no official support/firmware pathway specific to this model could be located. With sales ended and no documented updates or warranty framework for this SKU, long-term serviceability is uncertain, warranting a low score grounded solely in objective availability facts [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Pursuing side-sleep comfort is a coherent use-case, but without controlled acoustic evidence or measurable transparency-improving features (e.g., ANC performance, verified tuning targets), the approach reads as cost-driven commodity execution rather than a measurement-anchored design program. No non-scientific claims were identified; thus the score reflects limited evidence of engineering aimed at audible transparency.

## Advice

We do not recommend seeking this discontinued model. If you need a compact, inexpensive option for light, in-bed listening, the **JLab GO Air POP** offers similar functions plus publicly documented lab data at **19.99 USD** in the US market [2][3]. For purpose-built sleep use, consider current low-profile “sleep earbuds” that publish engineering details and maintain active support, noting higher pricing.
