## Overview

Amazon Basics PC Speaker targets ultra-budget desktop audio. The USB model lists 2.2W total RMS (1.1W × 2) and 103Hz–20kHz frequency range with simple USB power and an analog 3.5mm input/volume control [1]. The AC-powered variant ups output to 4.6W RMS with a 68Hz–20kHz range [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Key audible metrics are modest. The USB model’s 103Hz low-end omits almost an octave of bass relative to 20Hz–20kHz, and 2.2W RMS constrains achievable loudness [1]. The AC model improves extension and power (68Hz, 4.6W) but still sits far from transparent playback [2]. Independent lab data (e.g., THD, on-axis FR curves, max SPL) could not be confirmed at review time; mainstream reviews note distortion at higher levels and general limitations consistent with the specs [3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Small full-range drivers in plastic enclosures with basic Class-D amplification; no disclosed DSP or multi-way design. This is a typical low-cost OEM implementation appropriate to the price tier.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** Cyber Acoustics CA-2014/CA-2014RB (2.0). Same use case (wired desktop 2.0) and **equal-or-better basics**: 4W RMS and 85Hz–18kHz [6] at a confirmed street price of **16.99 USD** [5], versus **18.16 USD** for the Amazon Basics USB model at review time [1].  
16.99 USD ÷ 18.16 USD ≈ 0.94 → **0.9**.

*(Context)* Creative Pebble offers higher output/bandwidth at a higher typical price and is not the cheapest equal-or-better option; therefore it is not used as the denominator here [4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Amazon Basics products carry a standard **1-year limited warranty** through Amazon’s private-brand policy and are supported via normal Amazon channels [7]. No broad, model-specific defect data with controlled testing was found.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design prioritizes lowest cost and plug-and-play operation over bandwidth, max SPL, and features. For notification sounds and background listening, this trade-off is coherent; for music fidelity or game dynamics, it is limiting.

## Advice

Choose this if you need the **cheapest** way to get audible desktop sound and can accept narrow bass and limited loudness. If you want clearly better headroom and extension while staying tiny and affordable, look at **Creative Pebble** [4]. If your priority is **price among equal-or-better specs**, **Cyber Acoustics CA-2014** undercuts the Amazon Basics while meeting/exceeding key basics [5][6].
