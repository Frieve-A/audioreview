## Overview

The Schiit Audio Yggdrasil Plus is a flagship-class digital-to-analog converter manufactured by California-based Schiit Audio. It employs a proprietary R2R ladder multibit architecture called True Multibit™. The higher-tier version reviewed here (formerly "More is Better") is offered at 2,699 USD. It claims specifications of THD+N -110dB (0.0003%) and SNR >124dB, featuring a 5-year warranty and a modular design for future upgrade compatibility.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance sufficiently achieves the level of transparency required for faithful reproduction of the master source. The THD+N of -110dB (0.0003%) is significantly below the transparency standard of 0.01%. Other figures, such as an SNR of >124dB, a frequency response deviation of ±0.1dB, and crosstalk below -125dB, are also excellent and exceed the limits of human hearing. These measurements scientifically demonstrate the product's capability to accurately convert a source into an analog signal without coloration.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Achieving a THD+N of -110dB with a discrete R2R ladder architecture requires advanced implementation techniques, such as high-precision resistor matching and sophisticated noise management. Its performance is commendable compared to other R2R DACs. However, our evaluation is ultimately based on the final output performance (fidelity). Modern high-performance delta-sigma DACs surpass the Yggdrasil Plus, achieving THD+N figures better than -120dB at a lower cost. Therefore, while the technical achievement within the constraints of R2R is acknowledged, it is not outstanding compared to the best in the industry overall, resulting in a score of 0.7.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

For its price of 2,699 USD, the Topping D90 III Sabre offers superior measured performance for only 899 USD. The D90 III Sabre achieves a SINAD of 123dB (equivalent to a THD+N of approx. -123dB), which clearly surpasses the Yggdrasil Plus's -110dB. The cost-performance calculation (899 USD ÷ 2,699 USD ≒ 0.33) results in a rating of 0.3. As both units feature comparable inputs and outputs, there is no justification for the price difference.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Schiit Audio demonstrates a high level of corporate transparency and reliability by publishing detailed measurement specifications and offering a 5-year warranty. The products are designed and manufactured in the USA, suggesting reliable quality control. However, support and warranty coverage are primarily focused on the North American market and may be limited in other regions.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The practice of emphasizing measurement data and publishing specific specifications is rational. However, the adherence to R2R multibit technology cannot be rated highly from an engineering rationality perspective. Ignoring the fact that modern delta-sigma designs achieve higher fidelity at a lower cost, the strategy of differentiating the product based on R2R "mythology" suggests that marketing is prioritized over a scientific approach. The inclusion of a NOS (Non-Oversampling) mode, which causes measurable performance degradation, also deviates from the goal of pursuing pure fidelity and significantly undermines its rationality.

## Advice

The Yggdrasil Plus is a DAC with excellent measurement performance, but it cannot be recommended considering its price. Alternatives such as the Topping D90 III Sabre (899 USD) or the feature-rich RME ADI-2 DAC FS (approx. 1,100 USD) deliver equivalent or superior audio performance at less than a third of the price. Careful judgment is required to determine if the added value of R2R technology or American manufacturing justifies a 3x price difference. For pure sound quality (fidelity), we strongly recommend choosing the Topping D90 III Sabre, which surpasses it in measured performance.
