## Overview

The ASHIDAVOX PR-17 is a specialized magnetic earphone designed for professional radio communication applications, particularly for police officers and security guards. Manufactured by ASHIDA SOUND CO., LTD., a company with over 70 years of experience in professional audio equipment since 1942, this 9-gram lightweight earphone features an intentionally limited frequency range of 20-4,000Hz optimized for voice communication clarity. The product offers multiple impedance options (8, 80, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1kΩ) and detachable cord configurations, reflecting ASHIDAVOX's focus on robust, functional design for challenging professional environments rather than audiophile applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The PR-17's frequency response of 20-4,000Hz represents a significant limitation compared to standard earphone criteria (20Hz-20kHz ±3dB), though this range aligns with professional communication requirements where voice intelligibility matters more than full-spectrum audio reproduction. The 112dB sensitivity falls within acceptable ranges for earphone applications. However, critical audio quality measurements including THD, S/N ratio, dynamic range, and distortion characteristics are unavailable from both manufacturer specifications and third-party sources [1]. Without independent verification of core audio performance metrics, Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data, resulting in the baseline score of 0.5 as specified by policy for such cases.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The PR-17 employs mature magnetic earphone technology dating to the 1950s era, representing a conservative technical approach focused on reliability over innovation. While ASHIDAVOX demonstrates engineering competence through multiple impedance options and detachable cord design, the overall technology implementation relies on well-established magnetic transducer principles without advanced features. The lightweight 9-gram construction and professional-grade materials reflect appropriate engineering for the intended application, but lack cutting-edge technological integration such as digital signal processing, advanced materials, or modern acoustic design techniques. This conservative approach, while suitable for professional communication use, represents basic technology level by contemporary standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. At 15.60 USD, the PR-17 represents the cheapest option among professional communication earphones with equivalent or better documented specifications. Comprehensive market research for 8-ohm magnetic earphones designed for professional communication applications revealed no equivalent-or-better product with confirmed specifications available at lower pricing. The David Clark 10376G-37 earphone assembly [2] costs 21.75 USD and provides 8-ohm impedance for professional applications, but lacks documented frequency response, sensitivity, and other technical specifications required for equivalent-or-better performance verification. Extensive search of professional radio communication earpieces under 15.60 USD found no products with equivalent 8-ohm impedance, magnetic transducer technology, and documented performance specifications. No cheaper equivalent exists with verified equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance, establishing the PR-17 as the baseline pricing for this specialized product category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

ASHIDA SOUND CO., LTD.'s 70+ year history in professional audio equipment, including challenging applications like Mt. Fuji weather station installations, establishes strong reliability credentials. The simple magnetic earphone construction with minimal moving parts inherently reduces failure potential compared to complex electronic designs. The company's focus on professional environments requiring robust performance supports above-average reliability expectations. However, specific warranty terms, failure rate data, and global support infrastructure details are not publicly documented. The established manufacturer base in Japan and JEITA industry membership provide standard support infrastructure, though international service availability remains unclear for this specialized professional product category.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

ASHIDAVOX's design philosophy of "dedicated to creating sound" with focus on customer needs demonstrates rational approach for professional communication applications. The intentionally limited 20-4,000Hz frequency range, while poor for music reproduction, aligns scientifically with voice communication requirements where frequencies above 4kHz provide minimal intelligibility benefit. The lightweight construction, multiple impedance options, and robust materials reflect cost-effective engineering focused on function over audiophile specifications. The conservative technological approach avoids unnecessary complexity that could compromise reliability in professional use. However, the design lacks innovative features or cutting-edge technology adoption that could enhance communication performance or user convenience within the same cost parameters.

## Advice

The ASHIDAVOX PR-17 serves as a cost-effective solution for professional communication applications requiring reliable, lightweight earphone technology. Purchase recommended for security personnel, police communication systems, and industrial radio applications where voice clarity and equipment durability matter more than audio quality. The multiple impedance options provide flexibility for various communication equipment compatibility. However, avoid for any music listening, general consumer audio, or applications requiring full-frequency audio reproduction, as the limited 20-4,000Hz range severely restricts audio quality. Consider alternative consumer earphones for any non-professional communication use where broader frequency response and audio fidelity are priorities.
