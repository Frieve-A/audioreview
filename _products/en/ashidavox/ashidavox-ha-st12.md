## Overview

The ASHIDAVOX HA-ST12 is an over-ear music headphone featuring a 40mm dynamic driver with claimed 5-40kHz frequency response. Released in February 2025 at 46 USD, this model represents ASHIDAVOX's consumer-oriented approach while leveraging their 80+ years of professional audio engineering experience. The HA-ST12 offers basic wired connectivity through a 3.5mm gold-plated plug with 40Ω impedance and 99dB/mW sensitivity specifications. Available in multiple color variants including off-white, black, light blue, ash green, and ash pink, the headphones feature a retro-modern design with mirror housing finish and smooth headband adjustment mechanism.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. No credible third-party measurements are available for critical audio quality indicators including THD, SNR, frequency response deviation, or isolation performance. Only basic manufacturer specifications are provided: 40Ω impedance, 99dB/mW sensitivity, and claimed 5-40kHz frequency range without measured deviation tolerance. The magnetic circuit strength claim of "1 Tesla theoretical value" lacks verification through independent testing. Without measured data for comparison, objective sound quality assessment cannot be performed. Per evaluation framework for insufficient data scenarios, when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and even manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 pending availability of credible third-party measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Technology Level reflects moderate implementation combining established design approaches with manufacturer expertise. ASHIDAVOX demonstrates strong technical accumulation through 80+ years of professional audio development for infrastructure applications including broadcasting, railway systems, and government agencies. The HA-ST12 utilizes in-house engineering with 40mm dynamic driver and "engineering plastic film diaphragm" representing appropriate contemporary technology for the consumer segment. However, the design remains purely analog/mechanical without integration of modern technologies such as DSP, active noise cancelling, or digital connectivity. The claimed "1 Tesla theoretical value" magnetic circuit suggests attention to driver optimization, though no patent technology or proprietary innovations are evident. While ASHIDAVOX's professional expertise provides solid foundation, the HA-ST12 demonstrates conservative technical approach without cutting-edge differentiation that would require significant time for competitors to replicate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Current market price: 46 USD. The HA-ST12 provides basic over-ear functionality with 40Ω impedance suitable for portable devices, 99dB/mW sensitivity, and claimed 5-40kHz frequency range through 3.5mm wired connectivity. Comparison analysis identified the Samson SR850 as equivalent-or-better alternative at 39 USD. Equipped with 55Ω impedance for similar driving requirements and frequency range specification that provides equivalent basic over-ear headphone functionality. The SR850 offers semi-open design with third-party measurements available from multiple sources, compared to HA-ST12's claimed specifications without measurement verification. CP = 39 USD ÷ 46 USD = 0.85, rounded to 0.9.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Reliability & Support benefits from ASHIDAVOX's extensive professional audio heritage and infrastructure focus. ASHIDA SOUND CO., LTD., established in 1942, maintains an 80+ year track record supplying audio equipment to broadcasters, railway systems, fire services, and government agencies where reliability is critical. The company's motto "Good Sound, Robust Build" reflects their emphasis on durability, with manufacturing processes including "every driver-winding, assembly, and quality-control step carried out in its Ishinomaki factory to guarantee durability and consistency." The HA-ST12's simple over-ear construction with minimal moving parts and robust design approach inherited from professional applications suggests inherently reliable architecture. ASHIDAVOX's established global presence and decades of infrastructure deployment experience indicate solid support infrastructure, though specific warranty terms and response protocols for consumer products are not detailed. The company's long-term stability and professional focus provide confidence in ongoing support availability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Rationality of Design Philosophy demonstrates measured approach balancing cost optimization with functional requirements. ASHIDAVOX's emphasis on "accuracy and reliability" derived from professional audio applications provides scientifically-oriented foundation, with tuning guided by measurement-based criteria rather than subjective preferences. The HA-ST12's simple design approach actively reduces meaningless costs relative to basic headphone functionality, avoiding unnecessary premium materials or features that do not contribute to measured performance. Direct cost allocation toward driver optimization (claimed 1 Tesla magnetic circuit) and mechanical construction reflects rational resource distribution. However, the conservative technology adoption approach excludes modern digital signal processing, active noise cancellation, or software integration capabilities that could enhance functionality and measurement performance. The analog-only design philosophy, while cost-effective, represents traditional approach without innovation toward cutting-edge technologies that characterize progressive audio development. ASHIDAVOX's professional heritage ensures rational engineering foundation, but limited technological progression constrains advancement potential.

## Advice

For users seeking reliable basic over-ear headphones from established professional audio manufacturer, the HA-ST12 provides solid construction and company heritage at competitive pricing. The 40Ω impedance and 99dB/mW sensitivity offer broad compatibility with portable devices without requiring dedicated amplification. ASHIDAVOX's 80+ year professional audio background and infrastructure focus suggest above-average build quality and reliability compared to typical consumer brands. Cost-performance analysis reveals alternatives like the Samson SR850 (39 USD) offer equivalent functionality at lower cost, resulting in moderate cost-performance rating. Professional alternatives like the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x are priced significantly higher (99 USD). The HA-ST12 lacks measured performance verification and modern features such as detachable cables, active noise cancellation, or wireless connectivity that characterize contemporary headphone designs. Recommended for users who specifically prioritize ASHIDAVOX brand heritage and professional audio manufacturer reputation over pure cost optimization, while budget-conscious users may find better value in alternatives like the Samson SR850.
