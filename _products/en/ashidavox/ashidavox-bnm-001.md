## Overview

The ASHIDAVOX BNM-001 is a specialized binaural microphone designed exclusively for sound recording, deliberately excluding earphone functionality to optimize microphone performance. Developed by ASHIDA SOUND CO., LTD., a Japanese company with over 80 years of professional audio experience, this product embodies the design philosophy of "natural sound reproduction" by positioning microphones at ear canal locations. Weighing approximately 8g without cable, the BNM-001 features electret condenser technology with plug-in power operation and targets applications including ASMR recording, live concert capture, and environmental sound documentation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The BNM-001's measured performance places multiple indicators at problematic levels according to microphone evaluation criteria. S/N ratio of 75dB Typ falls between the problematic threshold (60dB) and transparent level (80dB), representing borderline performance. Maximum input SPL of 116dB S.P.L Typ falls below the 120dB problematic threshold, limiting dynamic range capability for live performance recording. Frequency response range of 60Hz-20kHz lacks the lowest frequencies compared to the ideal 20Hz-20kHz specification. Output sensitivity of -32dB at 1kHz and output impedance of 1.9kΩ fall within standard ranges. The electret condenser microphone type represents mature technology. No equivalent noise level data is provided, preventing evaluation of this critical microphone specification [1]. Conservative evaluation is applied due to reliance on manufacturer specifications without independent third-party verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The BNM-001 employs standard electret condenser microphone technology without proprietary innovations or cutting-edge advancements. ASHIDAVOX demonstrates in-house design capabilities and benefits from 80+ years of professional audio expertise, reflecting accumulated technical know-how. The technology represents mature, widely-available approaches that can be easily replicated by competitors, providing limited competitive advantage duration. The analog-only approach lacks digital integration or advanced signal processing capabilities. The design decision to exclude earphone functionality demonstrates focused engineering but does not constitute significant technical advancement. While the company maintains Japanese manufacturing precision and in-house R&D capabilities, the underlying microphone technology does not represent industry-leading innovation or sophisticated implementation beyond contemporary standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The ASHIDAVOX BNM-001 is priced at 51 USD and provides binaural recording capability with electret condenser microphone technology, S/N ratio of 75dB, maximum input SPL of 116dB, frequency response of 60Hz-20kHz, and ready-to-use configuration with 1,300mm cable. Comprehensive market investigation reveals no ready-to-use binaural microphone products with equivalent or better specifications available at lower prices. Competing products either demonstrate inferior performance specifications (Sound Professionals SP-TFB-2 with 60dB S/N ratio at 99.95 USD) or command significantly higher prices (LOM mikroUši at 95-100 USD, 3Dio Free Space at 399 USD). Alternative bare microphone capsules (PUI AOM-5024L-HD-R at 3.67 USD each) require DIY assembly and additional components, failing to provide equivalent user-facing functionality as a complete system. The BNM-001 represents the most cost-effective solution among products offering equivalent binaural recording functionality and performance specifications.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ASHIDAVOX provides customer support during business hours (9:00-12:00, 13:00-16:00) with contact available through their website contact page. The company operates from Tokyo with manufacturing facilities in Japan, maintaining traditional Japanese precision manufacturing standards. Support infrastructure appears primarily dealer-based with limited global presence compared to larger manufacturers. The electret condenser microphone design represents inherently reliable technology with minimal mechanical complexity and few moving parts, contributing to durability expectations. ASHIDAVOX's 80+ year history in professional audio applications for broadcasters, railways, and government agencies suggests accumulated expertise in durable product design. The company's "Good Sound, Robust Build" philosophy emphasizes reliability principles. However, specific warranty period information is not clearly provided in available documentation, and repair response capabilities appear limited to business hours with potential delays during company holidays.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The BNM-001 embodies a rational design philosophy centered on "natural sound reproduction" through strategic microphone positioning without earphone interference. The decision to exclude earphone functionality demonstrates scientific understanding of binaural recording principles, prioritizing microphone performance over multi-function convenience. This approach aligns with measurement-focused audio engineering by eliminating potential acoustic complications from earphone drivers. The company's "Good Sound, Robust Build" motto reflects measurement-oriented development priorities rather than subjective marketing claims. Plug-in power operation ensures broad compatibility with standard recording equipment using scientifically established power delivery methods. The electret condenser technology choice represents a scientifically sound approach for small-form binaural recording applications. Cost optimization through function-focused design eliminates unnecessary complexity while maintaining core performance requirements. The design philosophy demonstrates logical trade-offs between functionality and acoustic performance, though the conservative approach using proven technology lacks innovation compared to cutting-edge developments in digital signal processing or advanced microphone technologies.

## Advice

The ASHIDAVOX BNM-001 serves as an entry-level solution for users requiring dedicated binaural recording capability without the complexity of higher-end professional systems. Its microphone-only design makes it suitable for applications where monitoring during recording is not essential, such as ASMR content creation or environmental sound capture. The competitive cost-performance ratio makes it accessible for hobbyists and content creators seeking binaural recording functionality without significant investment. However, users requiring higher dynamic range capability for live performance recording should consider the 116dB maximum SPL limitation. The 60Hz-20kHz frequency response may limit effectiveness for applications requiring full-range capture. Professional users demanding superior S/N ratio performance should evaluate higher-specification alternatives despite increased cost. The plug-in power requirement necessitates compatible recording equipment. For users prioritizing cost-effectiveness in binaural recording applications with moderate performance requirements, the BNM-001 represents a rational choice within its market segment.
