## Overview

The ASHIDAVOX ST-90-05-H represents an evolution of the professional ST-90 model, transitioning from studio and broadcast applications to consumer music use. Manufactured by ASHIDA SOUND CO., LTD., a Japanese company with over 80 years of acoustic equipment manufacturing experience since 1942, these **on-ear** headphones feature a 40mm dynamic driver with a 1 Tesla magnetic circuit. Weighing approximately 110g with a retro-modern design, the ST-90-05-H is priced at 44 USD and targets users seeking Japanese manufacturing quality at an accessible price point.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Official specifications include frequency response of 5–40,000 Hz (no deviation tolerance specified), sensitivity of 104 dB/mW, impedance of 40 Ω, and maximum input of 1,000 mW (IEC) [1]. However, no independent measurement data for THD, SNR, crosstalk, dynamic range, or IMD is publicly available. The frequency response claims extend beyond the audible range but lack the deviation tolerance specifications required for scientific evaluation. Without credible third-party measurements to verify performance claims, the evaluation defaults to industry average standard when measurement results are unknown.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ST-90-05-H incorporates proprietary engineering plastic film diaphragm technology with optimized damping characteristics, representing in-house design leveraging ASHIDAVOX's 80+ years of accumulated headphone engineering expertise. The evolution from the professional ST-90 model demonstrates continuous product development progression. However, the implementation relies purely on analog/mechanical technology without integration of modern digital signal processing, software, or advanced materials that characterize current industry leaders. The 1 Tesla magnetic circuit and lightweight construction show competent engineering within traditional headphone design paradigms.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

At 44 USD, the ST-90-05-H offers good value, but **cheaper functionally comparable options with measurement-proven performance exist**. For example, the Superlux **HD681** (semi-open, over-ear, dynamic 50 mm) commonly retails around **29 USD**, and has third-party measurements available [2]. Given the presence of such a lower-priced, non-inferior alternative, the cost-performance score is adjusted accordingly.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

ASHIDAVOX demonstrates exceptional reliability credentials through 80+ years of continuous manufacturing experience since 1942, with the original ST series proven in demanding professional applications including recording studios and broadcast stations [3]. Japanese manufacturing processes and simple analog construction with fewer electronic components minimize potential failure points. The professional heritage combined with established manufacturing expertise provides confidence in long-term reliability and support availability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

ASHIDAVOX emphasizes quality-first product development rooted in professional studio heritage. Engineering optimization is evident in the diaphragm damping characteristics and the stated goal of achieving natural, well-defined audio across the entire frequency range. However, the purely analog approach without modern DSP or software integration limits innovation potential. The lack of published measurement data or scientific verification reduces confidence in the rational basis for design decisions, despite the company's professional pedigree and quality-first posture.

## Advice

The ASHIDAVOX ST-90-05-H suits users prioritizing Japanese manufacturing heritage, professional lineage, and build quality at an accessible price point. The combination of 80+ years of acoustic engineering expertise, professional heritage from broadcast and studio applications, and quality construction makes this an attractive option for users seeking authentic professional pedigree. At 44 USD, it offers a unique value proposition combining Japanese manufacturing standards, professional background, and quality materials. Those requiring published measurement data and technical transparency should consider alternatives from manufacturers or models with comprehensive third-party measurements.
