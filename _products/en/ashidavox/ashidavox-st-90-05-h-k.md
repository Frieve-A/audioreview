## Overview

The Ashidavox ST-90-05-H/K represents a consumer adaptation of professional audio heritage from Ashida Sound Co., Ltd., established in 1942. Available in gray (H) and black (K) variants, this on-ear headphone features a 40mm dynamic driver with claimed 1 Tesla magnetic circuit and targets music listening applications. The company's 80+ year history in professional audio equipment manufacturing provides the foundation for this consumer-oriented product, which emphasizes traditional Japanese craftsmanship and robust construction principles derived from broadcast and studio equipment development.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No published measurement data exists for frequency response graphs, THD, SNR, crosstalk, or other quantifiable performance metrics. Multiple conflicting specifications between sources create uncertainty regarding actual capabilities - frequency range claims vary from 5-40kHz to 10-24kHz, while sensitivity specifications differ between 104dB/mW and 100dB. Without independent measurement verification, evaluation defaults to the framework standard of 0.5, acknowledging that conflicting documentation suggests potential marketing inconsistencies rather than rigorous technical validation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ST-90-05 employs conventional dynamic driver technology with standard 1 Tesla magnetic circuit and engineering plastic diaphragm materials. While representing in-house design from an established manufacturer, the implementation lacks notable technical innovation or proprietary advancement. The analog-only approach without modern integration features, absence of patent technology, and reliance on mature industry-standard components positions this product below contemporary expectations for technical sophistication. Traditional construction methods, while potentially reliable, demonstrate limited competitive differentiation in current market context.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 44 USD, the ST-90-05 demonstrates excellent cost-performance in its category. Equipped with 40mm dynamic driver, 40Ω impedance suitable for portable devices, and claimed 5-40kHz frequency response, the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x offers equivalent functionality with 40mm drivers and similar impedance (47Ω) at the same price point. Since no cheaper headphone with equivalent or better specifications exists in the current market, the ST-90-05 achieves the maximum cost-performance score of 1.0. The Japanese manufacturing heritage and direct-from-manufacturer pricing provide additional value within this competitive segment.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Ashida Sound's 80+ year track record in professional audio manufacturing suggests inherent reliability foundation, supported by simple dynamic driver construction resistant to degradation. Standard repair services are available in Japan with documented pricing - cable replacement costs 26 USD including parts and shipping, while plug replacement costs 23 USD. However, support infrastructure remains limited to domestic Japanese market with business hours 9:00-12:00, 13:00-16:00, creating accessibility challenges for international customers. No documented failure rate data or extended warranty programs exist to substantiate long-term durability claims.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The company emphasizes "sound quality first and robustness principle" as core philosophy, suggesting measurement-aware development approach. However, absence of published measurement data contradicts scientific validation principles. Conservative analog design without cutting-edge technology adoption or innovation initiatives demonstrates limited advancement focus. While cost structure appears reasonable for delivered functionality, the traditional approach lacks evidence of measurement-driven improvements or adoption of modern technologies that could enhance performance while reducing costs. Design philosophy appears focused on heritage preservation rather than scientific advancement toward transparent audio reproduction.

## Advice

For budget-conscious consumers seeking Japanese-manufactured headphones with professional heritage, the ST-90-05 offers excellent entry-level value at 44 USD. The competitive price point provides access to established manufacturer quality, 40mm dynamic drivers, and straightforward functionality comparable to mainstream alternatives like the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x at similar pricing. The ST-90-05 suits users who value traditional craftsmanship and direct manufacturer support, though consumers requiring measurement-verified performance should acknowledge the absence of published third-party data. Consider this option when seeking proven Japanese audio manufacturing heritage at competitive pricing, understanding that performance verification relies on manufacturer specifications rather than independent measurement validation.
