## Overview

The ONIX Beta XI2 is a portable USB DAC/amplifier featuring dual Cirrus Logic CS43198 DAC chips with switchable tube and transistor output stages. Manufactured by Shanling under the ONIX brand, this 349 USD device offers both 3.5mm single-ended and 4.4mm balanced outputs with dual JAN6418 miniature tubes, TI OPA1662 op-amps, and BUF634A buffers. Supporting up to 32-bit/768kHz PCM and DSD512, it includes a 0.87-inch OLED display, five digital filter options, and gain control settings.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The XI2 demonstrates excellent measured performance in transistor mode with THD+N of 0.0006% (3.5mm) and 0.0008% (4.4mm), well below the 0.01% transparent threshold. SNR and dynamic range reach 124-128dB, significantly exceeding the 105dB transparent level. Channel separation at 73dB surpasses the -70dB threshold. However, tube mode shows degraded THD+N at 0.06%, placing it between problematic (0.1%) and transparent levels. Output power reaches 550mW@32Ω in balanced high-gain mode, sufficient for most headphones. Conservative evaluation applied due to manufacturer-specified rather than third-party measured data [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The XI2 employs contemporary CS43198 DAC technology with 130dBA dynamic range and advanced multibit modulator architecture. However, the design combines modern digital processing with antiquated tube output stages that provide no technical advantage. While Shanling demonstrates in-house design capabilities, the tube implementation lacks technical sophistication and offers no competitive advantages that other manufacturers would seek to replicate. The device uses standard components easily replicated by competitors, limiting technological differentiation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Comparison with the Moondrop Dawn Pro reveals significant cost-performance issues. The Dawn Pro at 49.99 USD provides equivalent dual output configuration (3.5mm single-ended + 4.4mm balanced) with superior measured performance: THD+N of 0.00014% (significantly better than XI2's 0.0006-0.0008%), SNR of 131dB (4.4mm output, exceeding XI2's 128dB), and dynamic range of 132dB (exceeding XI2's 128dB). Both devices support high-resolution audio (Dawn Pro: 32-bit/384kHz PCM + DSD256; XI2: 32-bit/768kHz PCM + DSD512) and provide dual output functionality with gain control. Equipped with equivalent dual output configuration and high-resolution audio support, with THD+N, SNR, and dynamic range that are equivalent-or-better than the review target. CP = 49.99 ÷ 349 = 0.1 [2].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The XI2 includes a one-year manufacturer warranty with solid aluminum construction and no reported assembly issues. However, vacuum tubes are inherently prone to degradation and microphonics, which are specifically excluded from warranty coverage according to manufacturer documentation. While ONIX claims to have minimized tube microphonics through special suspension systems, the fundamental reliability limitations of tube technology remain. Shanling maintains a reputation for good build quality, though support is primarily dealer-based rather than direct manufacturer service.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The XI2's design philosophy directly contradicts scientific audio principles by incorporating vacuum tube output stages that measurably degrade performance while increasing costs. Tube mode shows significantly worse THD+N (0.06% vs 0.0006%) compared to transistor mode, representing a step backward in measured fidelity. The design invests meaninglessly in nostalgic tube technology that provides no audible benefits while compromising the excellent performance capabilities of the CS43198 DAC implementation. This approach prioritizes subjective preferences over objective measurement-based improvement, fundamentally opposing rational audio engineering principles.

## Advice

Purchase the XI2 only if specifically seeking tube-colored sound characteristics despite measurable performance degradation. For transparent, high-fidelity reproduction, numerous alternatives offer equivalent or superior performance at significantly lower cost. The Moondrop Dawn Pro provides better measured specifications for one-seventh the price. Those requiring premium build quality and balanced outputs should consider options like the FiiO BTR17, which offers similar functionality with Bluetooth capabilities at comparable pricing. Avoid if seeking cost-effective high-fidelity reproduction or measurement-based audio performance.
