## Overview

The Sound Warrior SW-HP100 is a semi-open dynamic headphone manufactured in Japan. Key specs include 40 mm drivers, 38 Ω impedance, 98 dB sensitivity (1 kHz/1 mW), 150 mW max input, and 220 g weight. It uses dual 2.5 mm mono earcup jacks with a detachable 3.5 mm cable and supports an optional balanced XLR cable [1]. Independent measurement-based reviews are available, enabling an objective assessment [2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs are 10 Hz–35 kHz, 98 dB/1 mW, and 150 mW max input [1]. Third-party testing on a standard 711 coupler rig reports frequency-response behavior with a forward midrange, lighter deep bass, and low distortion at normal listening levels (see graphs) [2][3]. There are no signs of gross response errors; overall, measurements indicate competent—but not reference-grade—performance.  
(Notes: spec numbers are manufacturer-published; measurement trends are from independent sources.)

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design is a conventional 40 mm dynamic driver in a semi-open shell with practical dual-jack detachable cabling. Material choices and mechanical design are conservative rather than cutting-edge; execution is solid but technically unremarkable [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

**Price basis (review unit):** **100 USD** (≈ 15,520円 domestic street) [4].  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator:** **Philips SHP9500**—open-back, equivalent user-facing features, and strong third-party measurement results for response balance and distortion [5]. US street price **74.99 USD** is widely available [6].  
**Calculation:** **74.99 USD ÷ 100 USD = 0.75 → 0.8** (rounded to one decimal).

> Rationale (short): open-back with equivalent functionality; independent lab data supports equal-or-better FR/THD performance [5] at a lower price [6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Warranty is 1 year [1]. Domestic support is straightforward; international availability and service are more limited than major global brands. As a passive design, there is no firmware maintenance. Detachable cabling mitigates typical wear-out risks.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product emphasizes build locality and straightforward serviceability (detachable cables) over aggressive acoustic/engineering innovation. In a market where several competitors show stronger measurement-backed performance at lower prices, the design choices read as pragmatic rather than performance-driven.

## Advice

If you prioritize measurement-driven value, **Philips SHP9500 (74.99 USD)** is the simplest recommendation [5][6]. If you want planar tonality and a bit more low-end presence, **HiFiMAN HE400se (109 USD official)** is a sensible step-up option [12][13]. The SW-HP100 makes sense if domestic availability, dual-jack cabling, and Japan manufacture are key to you.
