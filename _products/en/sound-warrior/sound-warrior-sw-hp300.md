## Overview

The Sound Warrior SW-HP300 is a Japanese-made, semi-open over-ear headphone positioned as the flagship above the SW-HP100. It launched on January 22, 2020 in Japan. Key specs include 40 mm dynamic drivers, 40 Ω impedance, 102 dB/1 mW sensitivity, and a stated frequency range of 10 Hz–35 kHz. The housings use nylon resin to keep weight down and durability up, and the cups accept dual 2.5 mm mono plugs for the detachable cable. Made in Japan. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are no credible, comprehensive third-party measurements for the SW-HP300 (e.g., full frequency response linearity, THD/IMD vs SPL, crosstalk, isolation), so the assessment relies on manufacturer/retailer-published specs: 10 Hz–35 kHz FR, 102 dB/1 mW sensitivity, 40 Ω impedance, and 150 mW max input. Extension beyond 20 kHz is inaudible for humans and not evidence of audible improvement. Absent independent data (head and torso simulator/GRAS, test level, smoothing), the scientifically confirmed audible performance remains uncertain. [2][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The SW-HP300 employs a conventional 40 mm dynamic driver in a semi-open shell with nylon resin housings and standard dual 2.5 mm mono connectors. No evidence of advanced damping schemes, novel acoustical topology, proprietary diaphragms, or white-papered innovations is presented. In 2025 terms, this is basic, conservative engineering. [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Because US distribution is limited, we base the SW-HP300 price on current JP retail converted to an estimated **145 USD** (21,770 円 market price). As the **cheapest equal-or-better** comparator, **HIFIMAN HE400SE** is **109 USD** direct, with strong third-party measurements (very low THD ≤ 0.11% at 104 dB SPL; consistent FR). Functionally, both are wired, open/semi-open, over-ear headphones intended for critical listening; on measured distortion the HE400SE is superior, and its FR consistency is well-documented.  
**CP = 109 USD ÷ 145 USD = 0.75 → 0.8 (rounded).** [2][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Published information indicates a 1-year warranty and Japan-based manufacturing. International parts/support access appears limited versus global brands, and objective reliability metrics (MTBF/RMA) are not disclosed.[2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Pursuing a semi-open acoustic balance is reasonable, but emphasizing ultrasonic bandwidth (to 35 kHz) has no proven audible benefit. Without data showing improved linearity, distortion, or channel matching versus peers, the design choices read as conservative rather than demonstrably performance-maximizing. [3]

## Advice

If you prioritize measured transparency per dollar, the **HIFIMAN HE400SE (109 USD)** is the standout low-cost option with excellent distortion performance and solid FR consistency. As alternatives, **Philips Fidelio X2HR (~160 USD)** offers a lively open-back tuning at a still-modest price (not the cheapest), while **Audio-Technica ATH-AD900X** remains available but its current pricing fluctuates and it is not the least expensive path to equal-or-better measured results.
