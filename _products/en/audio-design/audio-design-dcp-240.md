## Overview

The Audio Design DCP-240 is a fully balanced preamplifier developed by Audio Design Corporation, based in Tokyo. Since its founding around 2003, the company has consistently handled the design, development, and manufacturing of analog amplifiers in-house for over 21 years. The DCP-240's most distinctive feature is its innovative "Amp-In-First" circuit configuration, which differs from conventional preamplifiers by first processing input signals through a flat amplifier before volume control, maintaining signal levels and improving dynamic range by 20dB.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The DCP-240's measured performance records a THD of 0.00063% (at 2V output) and an S/N ratio of 116dB (A-weighted, at 2V output), placing these figures in an extremely excellent range. The THD, in particular, achieves a level significantly below the transparent threshold (0.01% or lower), and the S/N ratio comfortably exceeds the transparent level (105dB or higher). The 20dB dynamic range improvement from the Amp-In-First configuration has also been confirmed through measurement, representing a scientifically significant enhancement. However, compared to the highest modern standards, products with even superior measured values exist, preventing it from reaching the top of its category.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Amp-In-First circuit configuration demonstrates a rational approach to conventional preamplifier design, with recognized technical originality. The concept of improving the difference between input signal levels and noise levels by maintaining signal levels is engineering-sound, actually resulting in measured dynamic range improvements. The accumulated design expertise over 21 years and a consistent in-house development system also form the foundation of its technical capability. However, in final measured performance, there are aspects that don't match competitive products adopting newer design approaches, meaning it is not the industry-leading standard.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The DCP-240 is priced at 3,667 USD (VR50 version), but the Topping Pre90 (approx. 600 USD), which boasts superior measured performance, exists as a competitor. While the Pre90 has few inputs on its own, it can be paired with the dedicated "Ext90" input extender (approx. 233 USD) to provide 4 XLR and 2 RCA inputs. This configuration offers functionality comparable to or greater than the DCP-240 (3 XLR, 3 RCA). The combined price of the Pre90 and Ext90 is approximately 833 USD. The cost-performance calculation is 833 USD รท 3,667 USD = 0.227..., which rounds to 0.2. This result indicates that a system with comparable or superior functionality and performance can be built for about 1/4.4th of the price, leading to an extremely challenging evaluation from a cost-performance perspective.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio Design Corporation is a Japanese company with over 21 years of track record, establishing a consistent in-house system from design to manufacturing. A support system emphasizing customer contact points has been established, including Q&A sessions via live streaming, listening sessions, and participation in audio fairs. Products are manufactured domestically in Japan, with direct support from the company's engineers expected. User reviews confirm high ratings for product quality and company response, reaching levels above the industry average in terms of long-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Amp-In-First configuration is based on the clear scientific grounds of dynamic range improvement through signal level maintenance, with an actual 20dB improvement effect confirmed by measurement. This design philosophy is rational, representing a logical solution to problems in conventional designs. The company's continuous attitude of verifying "what creates sound quality differences" and "what degrades sound quality" can also be evaluated as a scientific approach. However, in the final measured results, there are points where performance doesn't match products adopting newer technical approaches, leaving room for development from modern cutting-edge technology standards.

## Advice

The DCP-240 may be an option for users who find value in its unique technical philosophy and the reliability of a Japanese company. However, for those who prioritize pure performance and cost-effectiveness, extreme caution is advised. The combination of the Topping Pre90 with its Ext90 input extender achieves superior measured performance and comparable or greater input flexibility for approximately 833 USD. One must calmly assess whether the added value of domestic manufacturing and the peace of mind from local support can justify a price that is roughly 4.4 times higher. For a rational pursuit of audio quality and functionality, it would be wise to first consider the Topping system and then ask oneself if the DCP-240 still holds a compelling appeal.
