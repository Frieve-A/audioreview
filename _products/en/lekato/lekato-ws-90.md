## Overview

The LEKATO WS-90 is a 5.8GHz wireless guitar system manufactured by LEKATO, a company founded in 2019 that focuses on musical instrument accessories. The WS-90 features 24-bit/48kHz audio quality, sub-5.6ms latency, 105dB dynamic range, and 8-hour battery life. As a wireless solution, it competes against established brands while offering modern 5.8GHz transmission technology that differentiates it from 2.4GHz competitors.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The WS-90 provides limited measurement data for comprehensive evaluation. Available manufacturer specifications include 105dB dynamic range which meets transparent level criteria (â‰¥105dB) and 20Hz-22kHz frequency response which exceeds the standard 20Hz-20kHz range. However, critical audio quality measurements including THD, SINAD, IMD, and crosstalk are not provided by the manufacturer. Without credible third-party measurements and lacking essential distortion specifications, this falls under the framework guideline for products where insufficient data prevents proper evaluation, resulting in a baseline score of 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The WS-90 demonstrates solid contemporary technology implementation with several notable features. The 5.8GHz transmission frequency provides advantages over the 2.4GHz systems used by many competitors, offering better interference resistance in congested wireless environments. The system incorporates 24-bit/48kHz audio processing, 4-channel support, and Type-C charging with fast 1.5-hour charge times. However, the system lacks significant proprietary innovations or unique design elements that would distinguish it technologically from other products in its category. The technology represents appropriate contemporary implementation rather than cutting-edge advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 59.99 USD, the WS-90 represents the cheapest available wireless guitar system with equivalent specifications in the current market. Equipped with 5.8GHz transmission, 24-bit/48kHz audio quality, sub-5.6ms latency, 105dB dynamic range, 20Hz-22kHz frequency response, 100ft range, 4 channels, and 8-hour battery life, it provides comprehensive features at the lowest price point. Market research indicates that reputable wireless guitar systems start around 60-85 USD, with the closest competitor being the Behringer AG10 at 62.90 USD offering similar audio resolution and latency but with shorter battery life (6.5 vs 8 hours). Since no cheaper equivalent-or-better wireless guitar system exists in the current market, the cost-performance score is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The WS-90 faces significant reliability concerns that impact its overall value proposition. Investigation revealed multiple user reports of charging problems, with units progressively requiring longer charging times and some failing completely after only weeks of use. Customer service quality appears problematic, with reports of problem denial and refund refusals. The 12-month warranty period is below the industry standard of 24 months. LEKATO provides email-only customer service without phone support, and their response to technical issues reportedly involves requesting videos or photos rather than direct problem resolution. These factors collectively indicate below-average reliability and support quality.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

LEKATO demonstrates rational design philosophy through adoption of modern 5.8GHz digital transmission technology rather than outdated analog approaches. The company emphasizes R&D orientation and presents specifications in a scientific manner without unsubstantiated claims about subjective audio improvements. The feature set represents reasonable cost-effectiveness with technical specifications that directly contribute to functional performance rather than premium materials or marketing-driven features. However, the design approach lacks significant innovation beyond standard contemporary wireless audio implementation, representing competent but unremarkable engineering practice.

## Advice

The LEKATO WS-90 presents a compelling option for guitarists seeking wireless functionality, particularly those operating in environments with 2.4GHz interference where the 5.8GHz transmission provides advantages. The 8-hour battery life and comprehensive feature set make it suitable for extended practice sessions and small venue performances. However, potential buyers should carefully consider the documented reliability issues, particularly charging problems and early failures reported by multiple users. The limited customer service options and below-standard warranty period suggest this system is best suited for users comfortable with potential technical issues or those requiring only occasional wireless operation where failure consequences are minimal.
