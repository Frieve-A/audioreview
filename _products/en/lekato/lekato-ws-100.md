## Overview

The LEKATO WS-100 represents an approach to wireless guitar transmission, targeting musicians seeking basic wireless functionality with portable charging convenience. This 2.4GHz system features a transmitter-receiver pair with included charging case, claiming 24-bit 48kHz audio transmission and sub-7ms latency performance. The design emphasizes accessibility with dual plug compatibility (6.35mm/3.5mm), 190-degree rotatable connectors, and automatic channel pairing functionality. With 4-channel simultaneous operation capability and approximately 6-hour battery life per charge, the WS-100 positions itself as a wireless solution for electric guitars, bass, keyboards, and electronic instruments requiring basic cable replacement functionality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. The WS-100 claims "Full 20Hz-20kHz frequency response" without specifying deviation tolerances, making transparency assessment impossible against standard ±0.5dB criteria. Critical audio performance specifications including harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, and dynamic range remain unspecified. The stated latency of less than 6.7ms represents borderline performance between problematic and transparent levels, though company marketing elsewhere claims contradictory less than 3ms figures. One third-party review mentions "minimal tonal difference" but notes "drop in some high frequencies and overall body," suggesting measurable audio degradation. Without credible third-party measurements validating claimed specifications, conservative evaluation is applied per framework requirements. The claimed 24-bit 48kHz processing represents standard digital audio quality without differentiation. Available evidence suggests functional wireless transmission but lacks verification of transparency achievement across audible performance criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The WS-100 employs mature 2.4GHz wireless technology without significant technical differentiation or innovation. The system appears to use standard industry components and approaches rather than proprietary technology development. While the design appears to be in-house, the technology implementation represents established, easily replicable wireless transmission methods available across multiple manufacturers. The 2.4GHz frequency band represents mature technology with no competitive advantage duration, as comparable implementations are readily available from numerous sources. The technology integration remains basic analog/wireless only without advanced digital signal processing, software features, or intelligent functionality that would distinguish it technically. No evidence of patent technology adoption or significant technical expertise accumulation beyond standard wireless implementation. The rotatable plug mechanism and charging case integration represent practical design features but not advanced technological development requiring significant engineering expertise or creating barriers for competitors to replicate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Current market price is 49.99 USD. The Yuer TR-U1 Wireless System identified as cheapest equivalent-or-better product provides superior specifications across multiple performance metrics. Equipped with 2.4GHz wireless transmission, 4 channels, dual plug compatibility, automatic pairing, and charging case functionality, and 24-bit 48kHz audio processing, the comparison target provides equivalent-or-better user-facing features. The Yuer TR-U1 offers superior measured performance with 105dB dynamic range, -98dB THD+N, and longer 10-hour battery life compared to WS-100's 6-hour operation, while achieving better 5ms latency versus WS-100's 6.7ms specification. At 38.00 USD versus 49.99 USD, the TR-U1 delivers measurably better audio specifications at lower cost.

Cost-Performance calculation: 38.00 USD ÷ 49.99 USD = 0.76

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

LEKATO provides minimum 12-month warranty coverage, below industry standard 2-year periods. The simple wireless device construction suggests inherent robustness through minimal moving parts and components. However, investigation reveals significant customer service limitations including reported difficulties with return processing requiring shipping to China at customer expense approaching product cost. Multiple user reports indicate customer service denial of documented quality issues and refusal to process legitimate warranty claims. While the company states "100% customer satisfaction experience" commitment, actual user experiences contradict these claims. The basic construction and lithium polymer battery technology should provide reasonable inherent reliability, but the poor support infrastructure and limited warranty period significantly impact overall reliability assessment. No specific failure rate data is available for this model, though some users report mixed experiences with build quality and consistency.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

LEKATO demonstrates rational approach to wireless guitar system design with appropriate functional integration for target market. The design philosophy appropriately addresses basic wireless transmission needs with practical features like rotatable plugs and charging case integration that contribute to user convenience. Cost allocation appears reasonable for achieving basic wireless functionality, though the approach remains conservative without innovation beyond standard industry practices. The company claims scientific approach with "original sound transmission" and measurement-focused specifications, though actual measurement disclosure remains limited. The 2.4GHz technology selection represents practical choice for cost-effectiveness despite inferior performance compared to newer approaches. The focus on accessibility and beginner-friendly design reflects rational market positioning, though the implementation lacks advanced features that would differentiate it significantly from competitors. The conservative technology approach using mature components demonstrates cost-effective engineering priorities.

## Advice

The LEKATO WS-100 suits musicians requiring basic wireless functionality. The included charging case and simple setup process make this system particularly accessible for users new to wireless guitar systems. However, musicians prioritizing audio quality should consider alternatives like the Yuer TR-U1 which offers superior measured performance at lower cost. The 6-hour battery life requires planning for extended playing sessions, though the charging case provides convenient portability. Users should be aware of potential customer service limitations when considering warranty support requirements. The system works adequately for casual playing and practice applications where convenience outweighs optimal audio performance. Consider this product when basic wireless functionality is needed, but expect compromise in audio specifications compared to alternatives available at similar or lower pricing.
