## Overview

The LEKATO WS-50 is a 5.8GHz wireless guitar system designed for electric guitars and bass instruments. Founded in 2019, LEKATO positions itself as an R&D-oriented company focused on affordable musical instrument accessories. The WS-50 features 24-bit/48kHz digital audio transmission with claimed latency under 6ms and supports up to 4 channels for multi-device operation. The system includes rechargeable transmitter and receiver units with approximately 5-hour battery life, targeting musicians seeking basic wireless functionality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The WS-50 demonstrates adequate measured performance for its category, though evaluation relies primarily on manufacturer specifications. Frequency response spans 10Hz-22kHz with ±1dB deviation, exceeding the standard 20Hz-20kHz range but falling short of transparent-level accuracy (±0.5dB). Total harmonic distortion measures 0.02%, approaching the transparent threshold of 0.01% and significantly outperforming the problematic level of 0.1%. System latency under 6ms is acceptable for wireless transmission. Audio resolution specifications show conflicting data: official documentation claims 24-bit/48kHz [1] while technical manuals indicate 16-bit/48kHz [2]. Given this uncertainty and lack of independent verification, 16-bit/48kHz represents the conservative specification. Dynamic range is specified as 110dB by the manufacturer [1]. Conservative evaluation applied due to reliance on manufacturer specifications without independent third-party measurements [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The WS-50 employs standard contemporary wireless technology with modest technical sophistication. The 5.8GHz ISM band selection offers advantages over congested 2.4GHz frequencies, providing improved interference resistance. Digital audio processing at 24-bit/48kHz represents current standard resolution without exceptional advancement. The system appears to utilize conventional OEM/ODM design approaches without evidence of proprietary innovations or patents. While functional, the technology implementation lacks distinctive technical differentiation that would elevate it above competitive offerings. The 4-channel capability and automatic pairing represent practical features but do not demonstrate advanced technical achievement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

At 59.99 USD, the WS-50 faces competition from lower-priced alternatives with equivalent functionality. The Ammoon AM-5G provides comparable 5.8GHz wireless transmission, 24-bit/48kHz audio processing, 4-channel support, and similar latency performance (5.6ms) at 46.53 USD [3]. Equipped with equivalent wireless transmission capabilities, frequency response range, and audio processing specifications that are equivalent-or-better for wireless guitar applications. CP = 46.53 USD ÷ 59.99 USD = 0.8. This calculation demonstrates that equivalent functionality can be obtained at 80% of the price, indicating reasonable cost-performance in the wireless guitar system market.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

LEKATO provides standard 12-month warranty coverage, below the typical 2-year industry standard. The wireless system benefits from simple construction with minimal moving parts, inherently reducing failure potential. Customer support operates through email-based assistance with reported responsiveness concerns from some users. Founded in 2019, LEKATO has limited long-term reliability track record compared to established manufacturers. While the company emphasizes quality control in manufacturing, insufficient data exists regarding actual failure rates or repair infrastructure. The charging case design with 5000mAh capacity provides practical battery management but represents additional potential failure points.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

LEKATO demonstrates rational design philosophy focused on accessibility and functional efficiency. The company appropriately adopts digital wireless technology without resorting to subjective audio mythology or unnecessary complexity. Cost optimization directly supports stated mission of making music accessible to broader audiences. The 5.8GHz frequency selection and digital signal processing represent scientifically sound approaches to wireless audio transmission. Design philosophy emphasizes practical functionality over marketing-driven features, with costs clearly directed toward measurable performance improvements. The approach avoids inefficient analog nostalgia while maintaining focus on user-beneficial functions. This rational methodology supports transparent audio reproduction goals and efficient manufacturing processes.

## Advice

The LEKATO WS-50 serves as a functional wireless guitar system for musicians requiring basic wireless functionality. Consider this system if you need simple 5.8GHz wireless transmission with adequate audio quality and can accept standard warranty terms. The Ammoon AM-5G provides equivalent functionality at moderately lower cost, making it a more economical choice for the same capabilities. For professional applications requiring verified specifications and extended support, consider established manufacturers with comprehensive measurement data and longer warranty coverage. The WS-50 represents reasonable value for users prioritizing brand familiarity or slightly higher build quality over maximum cost savings.
