## Overview

The LEKATO WS-60 is a 2.4GHz wireless guitar transmission system offering 24-bit/48kHz stereo lossless digital transmission with 6-channel support. LEKATO, founded in 2019, positions itself as an R&D-oriented company focused on affordable professional musical instrument accessories. The WS-60 features >105dB dynamic range, 20-20kHz frequency response (+1dB/-3dB), and <12ms latency with 100+ foot range and 4-5 hour battery life. The system includes multiple plug compatibility options (1/8" stereo, 1/4" stereo, 1/4" mono) targeting guitar and bass applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate dynamic range >105dB meeting transparent level criteria and frequency response 20-20kHz +1/-3dB approaching transparent performance levels [2]. The 24-bit/48kHz sampling provides standard digital audio quality while <12ms latency remains acceptable for real-time musical performance. However, all performance data derives from manufacturer specifications rather than independent third-party measurements. Conservative evaluation adjustment applied per framework guidelines, reducing confidence in actual measured performance versus claimed specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The WS-60 demonstrates competent implementation of contemporary 2.4GHz digital wireless technology without significant innovation or technical differentiation. Design appears to be in-house development utilizing appropriate current wireless audio transmission methods. No evidence of proprietary patent technology or advanced technical integration beyond standard industry approaches. Technology selection represents appropriate contemporary choices but lacks distinctive technical advantages or competitive differentiation that would justify higher evaluation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price approximately 50 USD [2]. Competing products with equivalent-or-better specifications command higher prices: Harley Benton AirBorne (69 EUR / approximately 75 USD) provides equivalent 24-bit/48kHz audio quality, comparable <5ms latency versus <12ms, similar 6-channel versus 4-channel support, and equivalent 6-hour versus 4-5 hour battery performance [1]. Equipped with multi-plug compatibility (1/8" stereo, 1/4" stereo, 1/4" mono), 6-channel simultaneous support, and manufacturer-specified >105dB dynamic range and 20-20kHz (+1/-3dB) frequency response equivalent-or-better to AirBorne's 20-20kHz range and comparable technical specifications. No equivalent-or-better product identified at lower price points, establishing the WS-60 as cheapest option with these specifications.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Reliability assessment reveals concerning factors including 12-month warranty period below industry-standard 2-year coverage. Customer support operates through manufacturer email system with standard repair policies. As a company founded in 2019, LEKATO has limited track record for long-term reliability assessment. User reports across various forums indicate potential issues with wireless interference and battery performance over time, though comprehensive failure rate data is not publicly available.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

LEKATO demonstrates highly rational design philosophy prioritizing scientifically sound digital transmission technology with cost-effective implementation. The company emphasizes measurement-based approaches through 24-bit/48kHz lossless digital transmission and appropriate 2.4GHz wireless technology adoption. Design costs directly contribute to functional performance improvements rather than aesthetic or marketing considerations. Philosophy aligns with contemporary digital audio engineering principles while actively pursuing cost optimization for accessibility. No scientifically questionable claims identified in marketing materials, maintaining focus on measurable performance parameters rather than subjective audio mythology.

## Advice

The LEKATO WS-60 presents a compelling cost-performance option for guitarists requiring wireless transmission. Manufacturer specifications suggest adequate audio performance for most musical applications, representing the most affordable option with equivalent specifications compared to established competitors. However, reliability concerns and shortened warranty coverage require careful consideration for professional or mission-critical applications. Recommended for musicians prioritizing value, but professional users should consider higher-priced alternatives with better support infrastructure and proven reliability records.
