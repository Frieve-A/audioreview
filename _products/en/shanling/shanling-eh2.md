## Overview

The Shanling EH2 is a compact desktop DAC/headphone amplifier using an in-house 24-bit R2R DAC and a BD139/BD140 transistor output stage. Official specs list 4.35 W at 32 Ω from the 4.4 mm balanced headphone output (1.28 W SE), Bluetooth 5.2 (QCC5125) with LDAC/aptX Adaptive, USB-C/coax/optical inputs, and both RCA and 4.4 mm line/pre-outs. It measures 156 × 150 × 36.5 mm and weighs 713 g. An OS/NOS switch is provided. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Manufacturer measurements state: frequency response 20 Hz–40 kHz (-0.5 dB), SNR/DNR 118 dB, crosstalk 111 dB (32 Ω), and THD+N 0.02 % (32 Ω). THD+N does **not** meet a 0.01 % transparency threshold and no third-party lab data are available at this time; power is high (4.35 W @ 32 Ω, balanced), but given reliance on maker data the score is held at 0.6. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Shanling’s in-house 24-bit R2R module, discrete BD139/BD140 amplifier, XMOS XU316 USB interface, and modern Bluetooth stack (LDAC/aptX Adaptive) represent a competent, contemporary design. It does not, however, set new measurement benchmarks against leading delta-sigma rivals. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative: **TOPPING DX5 II** (balanced HP outs incl. 4.4 mm/4-pin XLR, Bluetooth with LDAC, USB/coax/optical, pre-out). DX5 II **outmeasures** EH2 by a wide margin (line-out THD+N <0.00006 %, SNR/DNR ≈132 dB) and delivers **higher power** (6.4 W ×2 @ 32 Ω, balanced) at a lower market price of **299 USD**.  
**CP = 299 USD ÷ 369 USD = 0.81 → 0.8.** [3][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Shanling sells through a global distributor network and provides guidance on warranty handling and unsupported marketplaces. Build uses an aluminum chassis and external 12 V PSU. Model-specific long-term failure data remains limited. [6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The EH2 emphasizes a discrete amplifier and an in-house **R2R** DAC—both cost-intensive while delivering **lower measured performance** than top delta-sigma implementations. While features (tone controls, OS/NOS, rich I/O) are sensible, the choice of discrete R2R for a transparent-target desktop unit reduces design rationality compared with simpler, better-measuring, cheaper delta-sigma competitors. [1][3][5]

## Advice

If you prioritize **measurements and power per dollar**, the TOPPING **DX5 II** is the stronger choice (far lower THD+N, higher SNR, more power, lower price). The EH2 remains attractive if you specifically want an **R2R** all-in-one with **tone controls** and **Bluetooth LDAC**, and you’re comfortable with modestly higher (still low) distortion. [3][4][5]
