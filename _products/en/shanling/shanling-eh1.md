## Overview

The Shanling EH1 is a desktop USB DAC/headphone amplifier built around Cirrus Logic's CS43198 DAC and dual SGM8262 op-amps. It provides USB-C input, 6.35mm and 4.4mm headphone outputs, switchable RCA line/pre-out, and an **S/PDIF coaxial digital output**. US street price is 199 USD[1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Representative published figures include THD+N of 0.007% (SE, 1Vrms@32 ohms, A-weighted) and 0.008% (BAL), S/N 119-122dB, dynamic range 119-123dB, frequency response 20Hz-40kHz (SE -1.5dB / BAL -0.5dB), crosstalk 99dB (BAL), and up to 1015mW@32 ohms from the 4.4mm output with DC power[2]. These values broadly reach transparency thresholds for electronics and indicate audibly clean operation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design uses proven chips and a straightforward topology, adding practical **hardware** bass/treble controls. Parts selection (aluminum chassis, SANYOUNG/Panasonic FC/ELNA Silmic II capacitors) is careful, but the architecture is conventional rather than groundbreaking[1][3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A cheaper **equivalent-or-better** alternative exists: **FiiO K11**, which offers 4.4mm balanced out, RCA line-out, **USB-mode S/PDIF coaxial output**, and stronger/lower-noise specs (e.g., line-out S/N-126dB, THD+N<0.00035%, 4.4mm 1400mW@32 ohms)[5]. With market pricing around **129 USD** versus EH1's **199 USD**,  
**129 USD / 199 USD = 0.648**, resulting in **0.6**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Standard distribution and warranty are available in major markets[1][2]. Some retailers note a two-year warranty[2]. Long-term field data remain limited given the product's recent release.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Combining balanced/single-ended headphone drive, switchable fixed/variable RCA, and USB-to-coaxial output in a compact chassis increases system flexibility. The physical controls favor quick, repeatable operation. Given the solid measurements, the feature mix is rational for desktop use.

## Advice

Choose the EH1 if you want **USB-to-coaxial digital output** plus capable headphone drive and RCA out in one box. If you want the same functional set at a lower price, consider **FiiO K11** (balanced 4.4mm, RCA, USB-mode coaxial out, and strong published measurements)[5]. If you need different I/O such as Bluetooth reception, other models may suit you better; note that options like FiiO K7 do **not** provide a digital **output**[7].
