## Overview

The Audeze MM-100 is a professional-grade open-back headphone that brings the company's planar magnetic driver technology to a more accessible 399 USD price point. Developed in collaboration with Grammy award-winning engineer/producer Manny Marroquin, the MM-100 employs 90mm planar magnetic transducers featuring Audeze’s patented Fluxor magnet arrays and Fazor phase management, with hand-assembly and testing performed at Audeze's Southern California facility. Despite its advanced technical implementation, the MM-100 represents Audeze's entry into the competitive mid-fi market segment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Available measurements show mixed results. Manufacturer specifications claim THD below 0.1% at 100 dB SPL (1 kHz), and independent testing reports *very low harmonic distortion* with no audible degradation at both 94 and 104 dB SPL. At the same time, multiple sources note deviations in tonal balance: RTINGS describes a mostly flat profile with **underemphasized low-bass (≈−4 dB) and recessed treble (≈−5 dB)**, while Headphones.com highlights a pronounced ~4 kHz dip into a mid-treble peak that can yield “a fairly unnatural, incoherent, and slightly disorienting” treble with lispiness in voices and cymbals [1][2]. In short, distortion performance is excellent, but the upper-mid/treble tuning departs from neutral targets.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The MM-100 significantly exceeds industry norms in proprietary implementation. It uses Fluxor™ magnet arrays to increase flux density and Fazor™ phase management for improved wave propagation [3]. The 90mm drivers employ ultra-thin Uniforce™ diaphragms with N50 neodymium magnets. Manufacturing employs laser etching for diaphragm circuit traces rather than acid etching, supporting high driver consistency, with hand assembly and multi-stage QC at the Southern California facility [4]. This technical sophistication places the MM-100 among the more advanced implementations in its price class.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Cost-performance is moderate at 399 USD when compared **across driver types and classes** to the lowest-price product that offers equivalent or better function and measured performance. A strong baseline alternative is the **Sennheiser HD 560S** at **199 USD** (open-back, wired), designed for neutral listening and measured to deliver a generally flat response with solid consistency [5][6]. Calculation: **199 ÷ 399 = 0.499 → 0.5**. This sets a stricter benchmark than limiting comparisons to planar models only; users prioritizing neutral tonality at lower cost will find the HD 560S more cost-efficient.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Audeze lists a **one-year warranty** for MM-100 covering all parts including drivers (drivers on many other Audeze models are three years, but **MM-100 is one year**). The warranty is **transferable** when originally purchased from an authorized dealer and runs from the original retail date. Direct warranty service covers parts, labor, and return shipping to the customer; within 30 days of purchase Audeze covers shipping both ways for defects. Separately, Audeze offers a **30-day return policy for direct sales** (original purchaser) with customer-paid return freight and possible restocking fees if items are missing/damaged [7]. Hand assembly and multi-stage QC further support reliability expectations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audeze’s design emphasizes measurement-driven transparency, resolution, and transient response, with core technologies (Fluxor, Fazor, Uniforce) trickling down from flagships to accessible models [8]. The lack of built-in DSP correction leaves the known upper-mid/treble deviations unaddressed, but the overall engineering approach remains coherent and technically rational.

## Advice

The MM-100 suits professional users and enthusiasts who value robust build and advanced planar technology. If you require near-neutral tonality at lower cost, the **Sennheiser HD 560S** merits primary consideration. If you prefer a planar presentation at a lower price, **HiFiMAN Sundara** also remains a popular alternative, though its pricing fluctuates and tuning differs.
