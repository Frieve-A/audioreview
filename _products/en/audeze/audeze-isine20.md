## Overview

The Audeze iSINE20 represents a pioneering achievement in planar magnetic earphone technology, featuring 30mm drivers derived from the company's full-size headphone expertise. This semi-open design incorporates three key technologies: Fluxor magnet arrays for enhanced magnetic flux density, Uniforce voice-coils with variable trace widths for uniform drive forces, and Fazor waveguides for improved phase response. The iSINE20 distinguishes itself as one of the first commercially viable planar magnetic earphones, establishing a new product category through advanced miniaturization of traditionally large-format driver technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third-party measurements from Stereophile reveal significant frequency response issues with the standard cable, showing problematic deviations including an early 1.7kHz peak and substantial 2kHz-8kHz trough below target curves. However, the optional CIPHER Lightning cable with integrated DSP correction achieves very good Harman target compliance. The THD+noise performance is described as "absolutely stellar" and "spectacularly linear," achieving excellent distortion levels <0.1% @ 100dB that significantly exceed transparent criteria [1]. When evaluated with the CIPHER cable providing essential DSP correction, the iSINE20 achieves borderline transparent performance, though passive response limitations prevent higher rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The iSINE20 showcases groundbreaking technological innovation as a first-to-market planar magnetic earphone implementation. Multiple proprietary technologies including patented Fluxor magnet arrays, Fazor waveguides, and Uniforce voice-coil designs demonstrate significant technical sophistication. The successful miniaturization of planar magnetic technology from full-size headphones to earphone form factor required substantial engineering expertise and established a new product category that competitors subsequently followed. Advanced manufacturing processes using laser etching versus toxic acid etching further demonstrate technological leadership and environmental responsibility in production methods.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At current market price of 280 USD (used market range 250-300 USD), the iSINE20 represents unique functionality combining DSP correction, app-based EQ control, and measured excellent distortion performance. Investigation of products with equivalent-or-better user-facing functionality (DSP correction, app control, high-resolution audio) and measured performance confirmed that the iSINE20 is the most affordable option among equivalent-or-better products. CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Audeze provides comprehensive manufacturer support including global warranty service, 30-day trial policy, and direct repair service where customers pay only shipping to the company. The planar magnetic driver construction offers inherent robustness with fewer mechanical failure points compared to moving-coil designs. Standard warranty coverage applies with repair or replacement at manufacturer discretion. The company maintains established support infrastructure with pre-paid shipping for defects within 30 days, contributing to above-average reliability expectations for premium audio products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Audeze demonstrates highly rational design philosophy through measurement-focused development using professional equipment including Neumann KU100 and G.R.A.S. KEMAR systems. The target curve approach based on Fletcher-Munson and Harman research reflects scientific foundation rather than subjective tuning. Quality control testing at each manufacturing step, proprietary technology development for measurable performance gains, and professional adoption validation support the technical approach. The integration of DSP correction to address inherent frequency response limitations shows practical engineering solutions combining analog driver technology with digital enhancement for optimal user experience.

## Advice

The iSINE20 is no longer in production but remains available in the used market around 250-300 USD, representing good value for its pioneering technology. For audiophiles seeking cutting-edge planar magnetic technology in portable form, the iSINE20 offers significant innovation despite frequency response limitations requiring DSP correction. The CIPHER cable with app-based EQ is essential for optimal performance, making the complete package necessary rather than optional. Among products with equivalent-or-better DSP correction functionality and app control, the iSINE20 represents the most affordable option. Buyers prioritizing natural frequency response without digital processing should consider alternatives, as the passive response requires active correction for balanced sound reproduction.
