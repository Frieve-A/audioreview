price: 1259
summary: "Professional 20-in/20-out USB interface with excellent engineering, stable low-latency drivers, and comprehensive I/O. Independent tests and official specs indicate performance at the transparency border (≈105 dB SINAD, DR 112 dB/115 dBA, THD+N <0.00063%). Cost-performance is pressured by cheaper interfaces with equal-or-better measured performance."

## Overview

The Fireface UCX II is a compact half-rack 40-channel USB interface (20-in/20-out) with two mic pres, AES/EBU, ADAT, S/PDIF, word clock, MIDI, DC-coupled line outputs, TotalMix FX, DURec stand-alone recording, and Class Compliant mode up to 192 kHz. RME’s SteadyClock FS and in-house USB drivers underpin its reliability. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Third-party measurements report line-out SINAD just under **105 dB** (4 V RMS / 48 kHz). [4] Manufacturer technical data specify **dynamic range 112 dB (115 dBA)**, **THD+N < −104 dB (0.00063%)**, **frequency response −0.5 dB @ 20.8 kHz (44.1 kHz)**, and **channel separation >110 dB**, all consistent with audibly transparent performance in normal use. [2] Round-trip latency reports using RTL Utility show **<5 ms at 48 kHz** with small buffers on Windows (system dependent). [5]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

SteadyClock FS (femtosecond-class clocking), FPGA/DSP-based TotalMix FX, DURec (40-ch stand-alone recording), DC-coupled outputs, and long-lived cross-platform drivers (recent Windows USB driver updates) reflect a mature, well-integrated platform. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Current market price: **1,259 USD**. As the **cheapest equal-or-better** comparator, **MOTU UltraLite-mk5** offers 18-in/22-out with ADAT I/O and a DSP mixer; independent tests show equal-or-better SINAD (~111–114 dB). [6][7]  
**Calculation:** 729 USD ÷ 1,259 USD = **0.579** → **0.6** (rounded to one decimal). Result: the UCX II does not lead on value when equal-or-better measured performance is obtainable for substantially less.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

RME is recognized for long driver/firmware support and stability. Updates and documentation are active; **manufacturer warranty is 2 years** in the US region. [1][3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The design emphasizes measurable fidelity: low-jitter clocking, flat FR, low distortion/noise, comprehensive routing/monitoring, and robust driver engineering. Investments (TotalMix FX, DURec, DC coupling) improve measurable utility rather than aesthetics. [1][2]

## Advice

Choose UCX II for proven driver stability, AES/EBU plus word clock, DURec stand-alone capture, and TotalMix FX routing in a compact format. If you mainly need multichannel USB I/O with strong measured transparency and ADAT expansion, **MOTU UltraLite-mk5** delivers similar audible transparency at a lower price, yielding better objective value. [6][7]
