## Overview

The RME HDSPe AIO Pro is a professional PCIe audio interface developed by German manufacturer RME. Released in 2020 as the successor to the popular HDSPe AIO model, it features a 12-input/12-output 24-channel configuration with 24-bit/192kHz support. The unit incorporates Asahi Kasei Microdevices' AK5572 and AK4490 converters, proven in the company's reference-class ADI-2 Pro series, and combines them with RME's proprietary "SteadyClock FS" jitter suppression technology to ensure high conversion accuracy.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measured performance of the RME HDSPe AIO Pro sufficiently meets professional standards. According to official specifications, the analog input boasts an excellent Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 115 dB (RMS unweighted, 20 Hz - 20 kHz) and a THD of -110 dB (< 0.00032%). The frequency response covers a range from 10 Hz to 20.2 kHz (-0.5 dB), enabling faithful reproduction and recording of source material. The inclusion of SteadyClock FS maintains an extremely low jitter level even when synced to an external clock, providing stable performance. While it falls slightly short of top-tier converters like the ADI-2 Pro FS, there is no perceivable difference in practice.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The HDSPe AIO Pro offers a rich I/O set with a total of 24 channels (12 inputs/12 outputs). It comes standard with stereo analog I/O (RCA/XLR), a headphone output, ADAT optical I/O (switchable to S/PDIF), AES/EBU I/O (XLR), and MIDI I/O, allowing connection to a wide variety of digital and analog equipment. Microphone preamps are not included by default but can be added via optional expansion cards. All functions are controlled by the included "TotalMix FX" software, which offers high routing flexibility and allows for the creation of a zero-latency monitoring environment via DSP.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At its current price of approximately 660 USD, the closest product with equivalent functionality is the RME Fireface UCX II (approximately 1100 USD). The UCX II is equipped with analog I/O (including mic preamps), ADAT optical, S/PDIF, AES/EBU, and MIDI interfaces, offering nearly identical functionality to the HDSPe AIO Pro. There are no cheaper alternatives on the market that integrate analog I/O, ADAT, S/PDIF, AES/EBU, and MIDI in a single audio interface. Combined with the ultra-low latency performance of its PCIe connection, it is an irreplaceable option with top-tier cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

RME is a company that has maintained a high level of reliability in the pro audio industry for many years. Its drivers are renowned for their stability and receive long-term support for both Windows and Mac. The HDSPe series has a track record of over a decade, maintaining an above-industry-standard level of low failure rates and continuous firmware updates. In Japan, an official support system is established through Synthax Japan, which appropriately handles technical inquiries and repairs. The warranty period is a standard one year, but the product's long lifespan and continuous driver support contribute to a high level of practical reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The PCIe-based design is a rational choice for achieving the lowest possible latency compared to USB or Thunderbolt connections. The adoption of converters proven in the ADI-2 Pro series to improve measured performance is also rational. However, equivalent measured performance is now achievable at lower costs with alternative products, diminishing the unique value proposition of dedicated audio interfaces. While the integrated ADAT/S/PDIF/AES/EBU support is useful for specific applications, it may represent excessive functionality for general use, leaving room for improvement in cost-justified value.

## Advice

The RME HDSPe AIO Pro truly excels in professional studio and broadcast environments that require simultaneous handling of multiple digital formats. When integrated operation of ADAT optical, S/PDIF, AES/EBU, analog I/O, and MIDI is required, it becomes an irreplaceable choice at approximately 660 USD. The measured performance reliably clears the transparent level, requiring no compromise in sound quality. Considering that the functionally equivalent USB-connected Fireface UCX II costs approximately 1100 USD, it provides extremely superior cost-performance combined with the ultra-low latency of PCIe connectivity. When considering a purchase, we recommend a comprehensive evaluation of whether a desktop PC capable of PCIe connection is available and whether all input/output functions are truly necessary. RME's reliability and support structure are at industry-leading levels, making it a worthwhile investment for environments that prioritize long-term, stable operation.
