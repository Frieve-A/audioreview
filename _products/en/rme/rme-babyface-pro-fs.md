## Overview

The RME Babyface Pro FS is a 24-bit/192kHz portable USB audio interface developed by German company RME Audio. Featuring a 12-input/12-output 24-channel configuration with SteadyClock FS technology, it is optimized for professional applications. The precision-machined aluminum block housing incorporates latest-generation AD/DA converters and proprietary TotalMix FX engine. Designed for single-cable operation with USB 2.0 bus power capability.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Measurement performance demonstrates excellent results meeting transparent-level standards. Microphone preamplifier SNR reaches 113.7dB (117dBA), and line input achieves 116.3dB (120dBA), significantly exceeding the transparent-level baseline of 105dB or higher [1]. THD measures below 0.00024%, substantially clearing the transparent-level threshold of 0.01% or lower. Frequency response achieves ±0.1dB at 44.1kHz and ±1dB at 192kHz, approaching the transparent-level standard of ±0.5dB. Dynamic range of 115dB also meets transparent levels, with femtosecond-precision clock technology delivering measurable jitter improvements. These measurement values represent levels that provide meaningful audio quality improvements for human hearing.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The SteadyClock FS technology derived from the company's ADI-2 Pro achieves industry-leading clock stability, delivering measurable performance improvements of 10dB THD improvement and 1.5dB SNR improvement compared to previous models. Advanced technical approaches include achieving 0.1Ω output impedance for headphone output and femtosecond-precision jitter suppression. FPGA-based TotalMix FX real-time DSP processing and stable bus power operation technology with USB2.0 also demonstrate high technical levels. However, it doesn't achieve perfect scores due to partial dependence on external technologies such as converter chips rather than complete in-house design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Against the current price of 130,000円 (880 USD), the Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 4th Gen at 100,000円 (700 USD) exists with equivalent 12-input/12-output or higher functionality [2]. The 18i20 offers 18 inputs/20 outputs with ADAT expansion enabling 16 additional channels, 192kHz support, and eight microphone preamplifiers, providing equivalent or superior I/O performance to the Babyface Pro FS, though Babyface has an advantage in portability. Calculation: 100,000円 ÷ 130,000円 = 0.77, rounded to 0.7 score. While RME slightly exceeds in measurement performance, the 18i20 is superior in practical I/O count and expandability, making cost-performance unfavorable.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Since its founding in 1996, RME has been known for industry-leading reliability, with usage records by major artists including The Who, Coldplay, and Elton John, as well as at the 2012 Olympics opening and closing ceremonies [3]. Provides excellent stability and low-latency performance through proprietary driver development. Offers 2-year warranty in the US and 5-year warranty in the UK. Through proprietary interface core development, RME has established a system capable of updates and fixes without third-party dependencies.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The scientific approach aimed at measurable audio quality improvements is commendable. Femtosecond-precision clock technology, THD improvements based on measurement results, and performance enhancement through specific numerical targets represent rational development policies. Achieving stable USB2.0 operation and bus power design also improve practicality. However, with general-purpose technologies available that achieve equivalent functionality at significantly lower costs, the necessity for premium pricing as dedicated audio equipment is limited. Some marketing reliance on abstract expressions like "professional quality" also contributes to point deductions.

## Advice

The Babyface Pro FS is certainly a product with excellent measurement performance, but careful consideration of intended use before purchase is recommended. In environments like recording studios or broadcast stations where the highest measurement performance and driver stability are essential, it offers investment value. However, for applications requiring 12 or more I/O channels, the Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 4th Gen provides equivalent or superior expandability at approximately two-thirds the price. Particularly with budget constraints, directing the price difference toward other equipment investments would likely lead to greater overall audio quality improvements. This product is recommended only for professional users who prioritize RME's long-term support and stability along with top-level measurement performance, and have adequate budget flexibility.
