## Overview

The RME Babyface Pro FS is a 12-input/12-output USB audio interface developed by German company RME. It incorporates SteadyClock FS circuitry equivalent to the company's flagship ADI-2 Pro, achieving femtosecond-precision jitter suppression. Positioned as a professional product, it features two high-quality microphone preamplifiers, 76dB gain range, 192kHz/24-bit sampling support, and ADAT/SPDIF expandability. Operating on bus power without external power requirements, it provides advanced internal mixing capabilities through TotalMix FX software.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Measurement performance demonstrates excellent results meeting transparent-level standards. Microphone preamplifier SNR reaches 113.7dB (117dBA), and line input achieves 116.3dB (120dBA), significantly exceeding the transparent-level baseline of 105dB or higher. THD measures below 0.00024%, substantially clearing the transparent-level threshold of 0.01% or lower. Frequency response achieves ±0.1dB at 44.1kHz and ±1dB at 192kHz, approaching the transparent-level standard of ±0.5dB. Dynamic range of 115dB also meets transparent levels, with femtosecond-precision clock technology delivering measurable jitter improvements. These measurement values represent levels that provide meaningful audio quality improvements for human hearing.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The SteadyClock FS technology derived from the company's ADI-2 Pro achieves industry-leading clock stability, delivering measurable performance improvements of 10dB THD improvement and 1.5dB SNR improvement compared to previous models. Advanced technical approaches include achieving 0.1Ω output impedance for headphone output and femtosecond-precision jitter suppression. FPGA-based TotalMix FX real-time DSP processing and stable bus power operation technology with USB2.0 also demonstrate high technical levels. However, it doesn't achieve perfect scores due to partial dependence on external technologies such as converter chips rather than complete in-house design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Against the 999 USD price point, the Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 4th Gen (700 USD) exists with equivalent 12-input/12-output or higher functionality. The 18i20 offers 18 inputs/20 outputs with ADAT expansion enabling 16 additional channels, 192kHz support, and eight microphone preamplifiers, providing equivalent or superior I/O performance to the Babyface Pro FS, though Babyface has an advantage in portability. Calculation: 700 USD ÷ 999 USD = 0.70, rounded to 0.7 score. While RME slightly exceeds in measurement performance, the 18i20 is superior in practical I/O count and expandability, making cost-performance unfavorable.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

RME is renowned for industry-leading driver stability and long-term support, with products typically receiving firmware update support for over 10 years. The Babyface series maintains high operational rates even in previous models, with extensive track record in professional environments. Through prompt technical support response and regular driver updates, it provides industry-leading reliability standards. Metal chassis construction offers high physical durability, with failure rates significantly below industry average. The only concern is potential high repair costs due to the premium price category.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The scientific approach aimed at measurable audio quality improvements is commendable. Femtosecond-precision clock technology, THD improvements based on measurement results, and performance enhancement through specific numerical targets represent rational development policies. Achieving stable USB2.0 operation and bus power design also improve practicality. However, with general-purpose technologies available that achieve equivalent functionality at significantly lower costs, the necessity for premium pricing as dedicated audio equipment is limited. Some marketing reliance on abstract expressions like "professional quality" also contributes to point deductions.

## Advice

The Babyface Pro FS is certainly a product with excellent measurement performance, but careful consideration of intended use before purchase is recommended. In environments like recording studios or broadcast stations where the highest measurement performance and driver stability are essential, it offers investment value. However, for applications requiring 12 or more I/O channels, the Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 4th Gen provides equivalent or superior expandability at approximately two-thirds the price. Particularly with budget constraints, directing the price difference toward other equipment investments would likely lead to greater overall audio quality improvements. This product is recommended only for professional users who prioritize RME's long-term support and stability along with top-level measurement performance, and have adequate budget flexibility.
