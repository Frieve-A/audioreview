## Overview

Building on the UFX+ architecture with redesigned analog/digital boards, the Fireface UFX III delivers 94×94 I/O (188 channels total) across MADI, ADAT, AES and analog, four premium mic preamps, TotalMix FX and DURec. It targets studios and broadcast facilities that demand transparent conversion, high channel counts, and robust routing on USB 3.0. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Independent Audio Precision testing by *Sound on Sound* reports **119.1 dB(A) dynamic range** for both A-D and D-A (AES17), and **THD between 0.0001% and 0.00045%**—well below audibility. Outputs are **DC-coupled**. These measurements substantiate transparency and place UFX III among mastering-grade references. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

- USB 3 provides up to **94×94 I/O**; at higher rates digital channel counts drop: **MADI 32 ch @ 96 kHz, 16 ch @ 192 kHz** (ADAT reduces via SMUX). [1]  
- **Class-compliant**: USB2 CC (no MADI) works on Windows/macOS/iOS/Linux; **USB3 CC currently works on macOS and some iOS configurations**. Full functionality and channel count require RME’s USB3 drivers on Windows/macOS. [1]  
- **DURec** supports up to **80 simultaneous channels** to USB media (configuration-dependent). [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

We found **no cheaper single-unit** that matches or exceeds the UFX III’s **94×94 I/O with onboard MADI, TotalMix FX/DURec, and measured transparent conversion**. Nearby options either cost more or fall short in I/O:

- **Universal Audio Apollo x8p Gen 2 Essentials+**: 16×22, **3,499 USD**. [4]  
- **Focusrite RedNet A16R MkII**: 16×16 Dante, **4,399.99 USD**. [5]  
- **Antelope Orion Studio Synergy Core**: up to 32×32, **2,995 USD** (insufficient I/O). [6]  
- **MOTU 112D**: 112×112 with MADI/AVB, **1,495 USD** but **no analog I/O or mic pres** (digital bridge). [7]

Given the absence of a cheaper equivalent-or-better unit, CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

RME’s long-term driver stability and build quality are widely recognized. Warranty varies by region: **USA 2-year manufacturer warranty** [8]; **UK 5-year with registration (UK-only initiative)** [9]; **Japan 3-year with registration** [10]. Documentation and tools (TotalMix FX, DIGICheck) support reliable daily operation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Engineering resources focus on verifiable performance—low noise/distortion, SteadyClock FS jitter control, robust routing, and backup via DURec—rather than cosmetic features. Technical constraints (rate-dependent MADI/ADAT channel counts; CC caveats) are clearly stated, aligning expectations with real-world requirements. [1][2]

## Advice

If you need very high simultaneous I/O, MADI integration and **transparent** conversion in a single rack unit, the UFX III remains a top pick at **3,199 USD**. For DSP-centric plugin tracking, consider Apollo; for Dante-centric facilities, consider RedNet. But for **maximum I/O per unit with lab-verified performance and proven drivers**, UFX III is hard to beat.
