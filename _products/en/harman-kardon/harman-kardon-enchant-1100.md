## Overview

The Harman Kardon Enchant 1100 is a 5.1.2-channel all-in-one soundbar with eleven drivers: six 55×90 mm racetracks, three 1-inch tweeters, and two 2.75-inch up-firing units. It supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and adds Harman’s MultiBeam room calibration. Connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6 with AirPlay/Chromecast/Spotify Connect, Bluetooth 5.3, one HDMI input, one HDMI eARC output, plus optical input and Dolby Vision/HDR10 passthrough[1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent lab measurements (full FR/THD+N/crosstalk) are still scarce. Manufacturer specifications list 315 W total output (RMS @ THD 1%), 52 Hz–20 kHz (-6 dB) frequency response, driver topology, and wireless/IO details[1]. Subjective reports note a slight emphasis in the lower-treble (≈2–4 kHz)[2]. Until robust third-party data emerges, the score remains provisional based on catalog specs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Up-firing height channels for genuine 5.1.2 playback, MultiBeam calibration, Wi-Fi 6/Bluetooth 5.3, AirPlay/Chromecast/Spotify Connect, HDMI in + HDMI eARC out, and Dolby Vision passthrough represent a solid, current-gen feature set[1]. It’s competent rather than paradigm-shifting.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The cheapest **equivalent-or-better** current competitor is Sony’s HT-A5000 (5.1.2ch with Dolby Atmos/DTS:X and an HDMI input). MSRP is 999.99 USD[6][9], matching Enchant 1100’s 999.95 USD street/MSRP[1][9]. Given equivalent user-facing functions and comparable measured performance class per third-party reviews[5][6], the CP score reaches the ceiling.

*Equivalence note (key points)*: Atmos/DTS:X support, HDMI input + eARC, room optimization (Sound Field Optimization vs. MultiBeam), and peer-class performance in independent tests of the comparator[5][6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Harman provides standard warranty and firmware updates (calibration/streaming). As a relatively new line, long-term reliability metrics and service network data remain limited; assessment is provisional.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design invests in user-visible, testable benefits: calibration, modern wireless, broad codec support, and practical HDMI I/O (1× in, 1× eARC) rather than marketing gimmicks[1]. That emphasis aligns with measurement-first priorities.

## Advice

If you want a single-bar Atmos/DTS:X experience without external subs/rears, Enchant 1100 is a sensible pick. In a Sonos-centric setup, Arc Ultra offers superior ecosystem integration but lacks DTS:X and an HDMI input; Enchant retains advantages there[1][3][4]. If you prioritize even greater expansion and output, consider Sony’s higher-tier HT-A7000 series[8].
