## Overview

The Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 8 is a distinctive portable Bluetooth speaker with a circular baffle and an anodized aluminum handle/base. It houses one 120 mm woofer and two 20 mm tweeters driven to 50 W RMS in a ~3.52 kg body. Official specs confirm Bluetooth 5.2, up to 8 hours of playback, and automatic self-tuning; no IP water/dust rating is stated.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent measurements report strong frequency-response accuracy and class-leading bass reach for this size. RTINGS lists **Standard Error 2.85 dB** and **Low-Frequency Extension (-6 dB) 46.2 Hz** for the Onyx Studio 8, which is excellent among portable single-box speakers. Manufacturer specs list **50 Hz–20 kHz (-6 dB)** response, **S/N > 80 dB**, and a **11.70 Wh (≈3.6 V / 3250 mAh)** battery. These jointly support balanced mids/highs with genuinely extended low-end for the form factor; stereo imaging at low frequencies remains physically constrained by driver spacing.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Topology is conventional (dynamic 120 mm woofer + dual 20 mm tweeters, class-D amp). Connectivity is up-to-date Bluetooth 5.2; the auto self-tuning is a basic single-box room compensation rather than advanced multi-mic adaptive DSP. Sustainable materials (recycled fabric, aluminum handle) are a plus, but acoustic novelty is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

We judge equivalence on user-visible functions **plus measured fidelity** (frequency-response flatness and bass reach). Among popular rivals:

- **Bose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen)** — Std. Err. **1.97 dB** (better) but LFE **64.4 Hz** (shallower bass).  
- **JBL Charge 5** — Std. Err. **3.75 dB** and LFE **59.1 Hz** (both worse).  
- **Anker Soundcore Motion+** — Std. Err. **3.48 dB**, LFE **60.8 Hz** (both worse).  

No cheaper model matches or exceeds the Onyx Studio 8 **on both** core metrics simultaneously while offering comparable portability; therefore CP = **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Build is sturdy (aluminum handle), but the lack of any stated IP rating reduces environmental robustness versus IP-rated rivals. Warranty terms in typical regions are limited to **1 year** (5 years for non-powered speakers).

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A living-room-friendly aesthetic with recycled materials is coherent; self-tuning mitigates placement effects but does not replace full-fledged measurement-led DSP. Omission of water/dust protection narrows outdoor utility.

## Advice

Choose the Onyx Studio 8 if you value **deep bass extension for the size** and stylish indoor placement. If ruggedness or all-day battery is critical, consider **JBL Charge 5** (IP67, long battery, powerbank) or **Bose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen)** (IP67, compact). These rivals are easier outdoors but do not beat the Onyx Studio 8 **simultaneously** on both flatness and bass reach.
