summary: "Portable Bluetooth speaker with premium design and impressive indoor sound. Three-tweeter array and Constant Sound Field widen the stage; measured battery and max SPL are modest, but current US street price makes it the cheapest equal-or-better option we could find."

## Overview

The Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 9 is a portable, home-first Bluetooth speaker launched in 2024. It uses a 120 mm woofer plus three 20 mm tweeters (center + L/R) and the company’s Constant Sound Field processing to present a wider stereo image. It supports Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint and Auracast multi-speaker linking, includes automatic self-tuning at power-on, offers a built-in handle, and runs from an internal battery. There’s no water/dust rating and no Wi-Fi.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent testing shows balanced frequency response with a low-frequency extension around 44.9 Hz and high-frequency extension to 19.9 kHz; it sustains about 88.1 dB SPL at max before compression rises (DRC 3.58 dB). Measured battery life is ~6.1 h vs the 8 h catalog claim, Bluetooth latency is ~24 ms (iOS) and ~124 ms (Android), range ~102 m, and a 3.5 mm AUX input is available; USB-C audio worked only on some regional variants and not in the tested unit. Manufacturer specs list S/N > 80 dB and the 3-tweeter transducer set. These concrete data points allow a moderately confident, measurement-first assessment. [1][2][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A genuine three-tweeter layout with a dedicated center channel, stereo playback without downmixing, and automatic room self-calibration are well-implemented, practical features. Multipoint and Auracast (Bluetooth LE Audio) support are modern, and the physical design is thoughtfully executed. There’s no breakthrough DSP or novel codec work beyond category norms, so this earns an above-average rather than cutting-edge score. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Basis (USD):** current representative US price for Onyx Studio 9 is **299 USD**. We looked for *equal-or-better* speakers (stereo playback, AUX input, ≥ Onyx max SPL, robust battery) and the cheapest credible example is **Bose SoundLink Max (399 USD)** with higher measured output (95.7 dB SPL, lower DRC 2.55 dB) and IP67. We did not find any cheaper model meeting or exceeding these user-visible functions and measured dynamics; alternatives with comparable or higher performance are all **≥ 299–399 USD**, so Onyx Studio 9 is the cheapest equal-or-better option we could identify today → **CP=1.0**. [3][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Build quality is solid for indoor use (aluminum frame), and the brand has established support channels. Lack of an IP rating limits environmental robustness, and long-term failure data are still sparse given the model’s recency. Firmware/app support is present via Harman Kardon One. [2][3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing a center-plus-stereo tweeter array and auto self-tuning targets audible improvements (clearer vocals, maintained stereo) within a compact, single-box Bluetooth speaker—reasonable engineering choices. Skipping water/dust sealing trades versatility for design/finish. Given measured battery life and max SPL, ambitions remain practical rather than radical. [1][2][3]

## Advice

If you want a stylish indoor Bluetooth speaker with real stereo, low iOS latency, and simple multi-speaker linking via Auracast, the Onyx Studio 9 fits well. Expect ~6 hours per charge in normal use and ~88 dB max SPL. If you need outdoor toughness or much higher loudness, **Bose SoundLink Max** costs more but is louder, lasts longer, and has IP67. If Wi-Fi or voice assistants matter, look at Wi-Fi speakers instead. [3][4][5]
