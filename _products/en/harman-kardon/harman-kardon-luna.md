## Overview

The Harman Kardon Luna (2023) is a compact, premium portable Bluetooth speaker featuring a 2-way driver system (48~90 mm woofer, 20 mm tweeter) with a rated 40 W RMS amp, Bluetooth 5.3, up to 12 hours battery life, and IP67 dust/water protection [1][2]. Sustainability is a design focus: the grille uses 100% recycled polyester yarn, the frame uses 85% recycled plastic, and the top panel uses 50% recycled aluminum [1]. Charging time is stated as 2.5 hours, battery capacity 17.28 Wh [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Available data is mainly manufacturer specifications. Claimed dynamic frequency response is 60 Hz–20 kHz (-6 dB) and SNR > 80 dB [1][2]. For portable speakers, this falls into a reasonable range, though transparency-class distortion, IMD, and detailed on-axis/off-axis FR plots are not independently published. In the absence of third-party measurements for THD/IMD and full FR, this score remains provisional and will be revised when reliable lab data appears.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Luna implements an industry-standard 2-way + passive radiator architecture with Class-D amplification and current-gen Bluetooth 5.3 [1][2]. Materials and finish are premium, but there's no evidence of novel acoustic topology, patents, or DSP that materially advances the state of the art beyond contemporary peers. Overall, this is a competent, modern design at the industry average level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Current market price: **145 USD** (denominator). As an **equal-function IP67** comparator, the JBL Flip 6 offers a 2-way system, IP67 rating, ~12 h battery, and similar manufacturer FR (63 Hz–20 kHz) [4], with third-party FR metrics widely available [5]. Best Buy lists the Flip 6 at **103.99 USD** for a standard color at the time of writing [6].  
**Calculation (explicit):** 103.99 USD ÷ 145 USD = **0.717** → **0.7** (rounded to one decimal).  
**Equivalence note (provisional):** Functions match (IP67, portable 2-way, similar endurance). Luna lacks independent lab data; based on manufacturer specs [1][2] vs JBL's spec [4] and measured context for Flip 6 [5], we treat performance as broadly comparable pending Luna lab data.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

US warranty coverage is **1 year** from authorized resellers [3]. The product's simple 2-way passive-radiator construction and IP67 enclosure should help environmental robustness [1][2]. Battery spec is 17.28 Wh with 2.5 h charge time [2]. Harman Kardon maintains a global brand/service footprint, but long-term field failure data is not yet available; thus the score is slightly above average, not high.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Luna's priorities—compact form factor, IP67 practicality, and use of recycled materials—are rational and user-centric. The acoustic approach is conventional but sensible for size. There are no unscientific claims; however, without independent measurements demonstrating standout performance, the design philosophy reads as refined execution rather than innovation.

## Advice

Choose the Luna if you value **elegant industrial design, IP67 durability, and recycled materials** in a compact speaker. If your goal is **maximum performance per USD** with similar IP67 portability, the **JBL Flip 6** is cheaper while offering equivalent core functions and abundant third-party measurements [4][5][6]. If you prioritize customizable EQ and measured low-end extension and can accept IPX7 (no dust rating), Soundcore's Motion+ remains a strong value pick; however, it is not used as the CP comparator here due to the dust-ingress difference.
