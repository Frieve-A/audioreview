summary: "Compact 10-inch powered subwoofer; adequate output above ~30 Hz but limited very-low-bass extension. At current USD 269 market price, stronger-performing subs undercut it."

## Overview

The Polk Audio Monitor XT10 is a compact powered subwoofer with a down-firing 10-inch driver in a ported enclosure. It offers a variable low-pass (40–160 Hz), phase/polarity control, and LFE/line-in. Manufacturer literature lists **“bass response down to 24 Hz”** and a **Class D amplifier rated 50 W RMS / 100 W peak** [2][5]. (Some retailer spec sheets list **40–160 Hz** as the frequency range, reflecting a more conservative spec for usable passband [6].)

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Independent lab measurements show **solid output above ~30 Hz with steep roll-off below**. In Sound & Vision’s bench test, the XT10 reached **~108 dB at 50 Hz** in-room, but output fell rapidly below 30 Hz; the commonly advertised **“24 Hz”** appears to be a marketing limit (likely at a looser tolerance than ±3 dB) rather than an on-axis −3 dB point [1]. Given the category’s expectations (audible impact in the 20–40 Hz band), low-20s performance is limited; however, general noise/linearity issues weren’t flagged in available sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A conventional Class-D plate amp and long-throw polypropylene woofer in a braced MDF, down-firing, ported design. No DSP, room correction, or app control. Basic integration controls are present and appropriate for the price.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better):** **Dayton Audio SUB-1200** at **USD 199.98** (Parts Express, current market price) [3][4]. It provides equivalent user-facing functionality (powered sub with LFE/line-in, variable crossover) and **manufacturer-stated 25 Hz extension** with a 12″ driver; while we rely on manufacturer specs here, it is broadly regarded as delivering at least comparable extension/output in the same use case.  
**CP calculation:** 199.98 ÷ **269** = **0.74 → 0.7**.

> Note: If future third-party measurements indicate the comparator is not equal-or-better in audibility-relevant axes (extension/output/THD), CP will be revised accordingly.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Polk’s official U.S. warranty for powered subwoofers is **3 years on electronics / 5 years on the woofer** [7][8], which is above the typical 1–2 year electronics coverage in this class. Global dealer networks and brand longevity are positives; no abnormal failure data specific to XT10 was identified.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A conservative, cost-controlled design that prioritizes footprint and simplicity over very-low-frequency performance. Marketing emphasizes “down to 24 Hz,” but available data suggests practical bandwidth is centered above the low-30s in typical rooms. No pseudo-scientific claims, but limited innovation for measurable improvement.

## Advice

If you need a **small, affordable sub** primarily for **music** or **small rooms** where content below ~30 Hz isn’t critical, the XT10 integrates easily and can be tuned to avoid boom. If your priority is **movie LFE (20–30 Hz) impact** at modest budgets, **cheaper subs exist with deeper extension and/or more output** (see comparator), making them better value today.
