## Overview

The Polk Audio Signa S4 is a 3.1.2 channel soundbar released in 2021. Priced at 265 USD, it offers Dolby Atmos compatibility and a 5.9-inch wireless subwoofer, positioned as a budget-focused product for users with cost constraints. It features VoiceAdjust technology and BassAdjust technology, with HDMI eARC support ensuring connectivity with modern televisions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Measurement data analysis reveals that the Signa S4 has problems in basic acoustic performance. The frequency response shows a V-shaped characteristic with deviations exceeding ±3dB in the 20Hz-20kHz range. Bass extension is insufficient, with the subwoofer lacking deep bass impact in movie soundtracks as it cannot reproduce frequencies below 45Hz effectively. The soundbar exhibits compressed dynamic range and exhibits some strain at maximum volume levels, though it can reach peaks of 102dB. While claiming Dolby Atmos compatibility, the upward-firing speakers provide only limited ceiling reflection effects, falling short of a true three-dimensional audio experience. The lack of DTS support also creates content limitations.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Technically, it does not exceed the realm of standard soundbar design. The configuration of 1-inch tweeters, 4.7×1.6-inch racetrack midrange drivers, and 2.6-inch ceiling reflection speakers is mediocre. The subwoofer's 5.9-inch down-firing driver also remains at industry standard level. While VoiceAdjust technology and BassAdjust technology show some uniqueness, they are merely applications of basic signal processing technology. HDMI eARC support is commendable, but this is an expected feature in modern soundbars.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The least expensive option with equivalent or superior functionality is the Hisense AX5125H, available for 232 USD. The Hisense AX5125H offers a superior 5.1.2 channel configuration with rear speakers, surpassing the Signa S4's 3.1.2ch setup. Compared to the Signa S4's 265 USD price, a more affordable and feature-rich alternative exists. Based on the calculation "232 USD / 265 USD ~ 0.874," the score is rounded to 0.9.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

While Polk Audio as a company is recognized for its stable quality, the support for this specific product is commensurate with its price. The one-year warranty, though shorter than the extended warranties offered by some major manufacturers on premium models, is standard for this price tier. While it may not meet expectations for top-tier support, such as frequent long-term firmware updates, basic reliability is assured.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Although Polk Audio generally follows a rational design philosophy, this product exhibits some irrational design choices driven by an overriding focus on cost reduction, such as the lack of DTS support. The reliance on ceiling reflection for Atmos effects is also limited by physical constraints, representing a trade-off where sound quality is compromised for price and features. While the pursuit of cost-performance is understandable, it undeniably sacrifices aspects of the core value of an audio product.

## Advice

The Polk Audio Signa S4 is worth considering for those with budget constraints seeking a basic Dolby Atmos experience. However, it cannot be recommended for those who prioritize sound quality. Particularly for those seeking deep bass impact in movie viewing or transparency in music playback, considering higher-priced products is advisable. The lack of DTS support, which creates limitations with some content, should also be considered. For long-term use, the support system should be carefully evaluated. When considering purchase, strongly recommend actually listening to confirm sound quality.
