## Overview

The Polk Audio Monitor XT35 is a low-profile center channel designed for setups where clearance under the TV is limited. It uses a 1″ Terylene dome tweeter and four 3″ woofers in a front-ported enclosure, targeting clear dialogue without blocking the screen [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent Klippel NFS data reports a Preference Score of **3.82** (with sub: **6.73**), **-3 dB ≈ 85 Hz**, and **frequency deviation ≈ 2.2 dB (300 Hz–5 kHz)** for XT35 [1]. Manufacturer specs list **57 Hz–40 kHz (total)**, **84 Hz–26 kHz (-3 dB limits)**, and **87 dB sensitivity (1 W/1 m)** [2]. Taken together, the XT35 provides intelligible dialogue across seating with limited bass extension, best used with an **80–100 Hz** crossover to a sub.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The driver set (Terylene dome + four small woofers) and bass-reflex topology are conventional and primarily optimize form factor for placement flexibility rather than pushing technical boundaries. No advanced transducer or waveguide features are present beyond category norms.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Price (review target): 249 USD.**  
To comply with equal-or-better measured performance, the **KEF Q250c** is a valid comparator (Preference **4.21**; with sub **6.96**) [4]. The **cheapest equal-or-better** option we can verify in the US market is **Q250c at 399.98 USD** on the official site [5], which is **more expensive** than XT35. Therefore, **no cheaper equal-or-better alternative exists** at review time, and **CP = 1.0**[4][5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Polk specifies **5-year** coverage for passive home speakers purchased via authorized channels [6]. The XT series has typical MDF/vinyl build and broad distribution; long-term field reliability specific to XT35 is not yet well documented.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Prioritizing a **very low height** is rational for real-world installations but imposes acoustic trade-offs (bass output, headroom). The approach is coherent for users needing ultra-slim placement, though it leaves absolute performance in the mid-pack.

## Advice

If you **must** keep height under the screen, XT35 is practical: place it centered under the display or wall-mount via keyholes, and set **80–100 Hz** crossover. Expect clear speech over a **wide horizontal area**; add EQ to gently relax treble if needed. If you have space for a taller unit and seek higher measured performance, consider stepping up to options like **KEF Q250c** (costs more) [4]. Cheaper centers such as **JBL Stage A125C** exist but **measure worse** than XT35 and are not equal-or-better comparators [3].
