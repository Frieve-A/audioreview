## Overview

The Polk Audio Reserve R700 is a 3-way tower speaker featuring a 1-inch Pinnacle Ring Radiator tweeter, 6.5-inch Turbine Cone midrange, and dual 8-inch long-throw woofers. It offers a frequency response of 38Hz-38kHz and 88dB sensitivity, with Hi-Res Audio certification. The product leverages Polk Audio's technical expertise to achieve a balance between measurement performance and sound quality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Reserve R700 demonstrates good measurement performance. The frequency response achieves flatness within ±3dB from 38Hz to 38kHz, with stable operation at 8Ω nominal impedance (minimum 3.6Ω). The measured sensitivity is 88.9dB, showing high consistency with nominal specifications. The low-frequency reproduction capability with 35Hz port tuning reaches good levels for speaker categories, confirming audible improvement effects. However, the measurement results fall slightly short of transparency levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The Pinnacle Ring Radiator tweeter represents a high-performance driver with Polk Audio's proprietary design. The Eigentone filter technology reduces resonance by 14dB, while Power Port 2.0 technology achieves performance surpassing previous products. The 3-way design with optimized crossover frequencies and appropriate internal cabinet bracing structure achieves technology levels exceeding industry standards. However, innovative technical elements are limited, and it does not reach the highest industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The Polk Audio Reserve R700 (priced at 2,298 USD per pair) is reviewed for its cost-performance. Despite its high price, there are no other products on the market that offer the same level of performance, particularly its exceptional bass extension and low distortion, at a lower price point. When compared with other high-end speakers, the R700 provides superior or equivalent performance for the cost. Therefore, it achieves a perfect score in this category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Polk Audio is an established American audio manufacturer with over 50 years of experience. The Reserve R700 comes with standard warranty coverage and established repair infrastructure. The product failure rate is maintained below industry average, though compared to some premium audio brands, there is room for improvement in support system comprehensiveness. Product quality stability is high, ensuring reliability for long-term use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Reserve R700's design philosophy adopts a rational approach to pursuing measurement performance improvements and sound quality enhancement based on scientific evidence. The adoption of technologies with measurable effects, such as resonance suppression through Eigentone filters and low-frequency improvement via Power Port 2.0, is commendable. The utilization of physical characteristics difficult to achieve with general-purpose equipment as dedicated audio equipment is also rational. However, clear technical advantages compared to competing products are limited, and the existence of more efficient alternatives should be considered.

## Advice

The Polk Audio Reserve R700 is a highly recommended tower speaker that delivers class-leading measurement performance at an astonishing price. Based on objective data, its neutral and accurate sound has the potential to rival products at several times its price. While other options exist in the same price range, none surpass the overwhelming performance-to-price ratio of the R700. If you are looking to get the best acoustic performance at the most reasonable cost, this speaker is one of the best options available on the market today.
