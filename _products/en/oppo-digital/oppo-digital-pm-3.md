## Overview

The OPPO PM-3 represents a pioneering achievement in portable planar magnetic headphone design. Released in 2014 as the world's first truly portable closed-back planar magnetic headphone at just 320g, it combines advanced driver technology with mobile device compatibility. Designed by Igor Levitsky of BG Radia fame, the PM-3 features 55mm circular planar magnetic drivers with 26-ohm impedance and 102dB sensitivity, making it highly efficient for smartphone use. Originally priced at 399 USD, the PM-3 was discontinued in 2018 when OPPO Digital exited the audio market, though the company continues limited customer support for existing products.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The PM-3 demonstrates measured performance at the transparent level THD performance. RTINGS third-party measurements show the headphones achieve ±3dB deviation across most of the 20Hz-20kHz range [2]. The mid-range (200Hz-2kHz) achieves ±1dB within the transparent level, making it suitable for voice reproduction. THD measurements show 0.152% at 90dB and 0.061% at 100dB, maintaining transparent level performance (below 0.1%), indicating excellent distortion characteristics. While Stereophile measurements confirm low distortion levels with the 100dB curve lying at or below the 90dB curve, indicating good dynamic range capability [1], there are some challenges with frequency response flatness. Multiple independent sources verify very low THD performance, particularly in bass regions where planar magnetic technology excels. Sound isolation measurements confirm adequate passive isolation performance typical of closed-back designs. The 102dB sensitivity combined with 26-ohm impedance provides excellent driveability from portable devices.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The PM-3 incorporates notable technological achievements for its era. As the world's first truly portable closed-back planar magnetic headphone, it represents significant engineering innovation in miniaturizing planar technology while maintaining closed-back acoustics. The circular 55mm planar magnetic driver design differs from OPPO's larger open-back models, demonstrating successful adaptation of planar technology for portable applications. Designer Igor Levitsky contributed established expertise from BG Radia, implementing proven planar magnetic driver technology with 7-layer voice coil diaphragm and neodymium magnet system. However, the technology primarily represents adaptation rather than breakthrough innovation. While the portable closed-back planar implementation was novel in 2014, it lacks cutting-edge features like DSP, advanced digital integration, or proprietary patent technologies that would elevate the score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Based on current market availability, the PM-3 can be found on the used market for 200-300 USD with 250 USD representing average pricing. Following policy guidelines, internal construction differences (driver types) are ignored, comparing against the world's cheapest product with equivalent or better functions and performance. Research reveals equivalent measured performance (frequency response ±3dB, THD below 0.1%) and closed-back over-ear functionality available at lower cost through alternative products. High-efficiency open-back options like the HIFIMAN HE400SE at 149 USD offer superior measured performance with equivalent driver technology, though lacking sound isolation [3]. For closed-back design maintenance, products like the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x at 125 USD provide equivalent frequency response and THD performance. For users requiring portable high-fidelity audio, smartphone plus external DAC/amplifier combinations achieve equivalent or superior measured performance at lower total cost. CP = 125 USD ÷ 250 USD = 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The PM-3 faces significant reliability and support challenges due to OPPO Digital's exit from the audio market in April 2018. While the company initially provided 1-year warranty coverage and maintained customer support post-discontinuation, long-term support prospects are severely limited. The 1-year warranty period falls below industry average, and common earpad degradation issues are frequently reported [3]. Discontinued status means no replacement parts manufacturing, particularly affecting earpad replacement where aftermarket options reportedly lack original quality. However, the fundamental planar magnetic construction is inherently robust with no complex electronics or firmware requiring updates. The simple analog design provides some resilience, but the lack of manufacturer support and parts availability significantly impacts long-term viability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

OPPO Digital's approach to the PM-3 demonstrates mixed rationality in design philosophy. While the company correctly identified the gap between high-performance planar magnetic technology and portable applications, the execution shows concerning limitations. The frequency response achieving only ±3dB deviation indicates insufficient engineering optimization for transparent reproduction, suggesting design priorities that compromise audible performance. Igor Levitsky's conviction regarding planar magnetic advantages requires verification through measurement rather than assumption [4]. The analog-only approach without digital signal processing or room correction capabilities represents outdated methodology when superior alternatives exist. The conservative design philosophy lacks cutting-edge technologies that could improve measured performance, such as DSP-based corrections for frequency response irregularities. While the portable form factor addresses practical needs, the failure to achieve transparent-level measurements suggests irrational allocation of engineering resources toward aesthetics rather than audible improvements.

## Advice

The OPPO PM-3 presents a challenging proposition for users seeking portable planar magnetic performance. While offering closed-back planar technology at used market prices of 200-300 USD, the ±3dB frequency response deviation places measured performance at problematic levels that affect audible quality. Alternative approaches provide equivalent or superior functionality at lower cost: the Dekoni planar magnetic headphones under 250 USD offer equivalent planar technology and portability, while open-back options like the HIFIMAN HE400SE at 149 USD provide equivalent driver technology with superior measured performance despite lacking sound isolation. The unique closed-back planar design offers practical advantages in noise environments, but the problematic-level frequency response limits its value proposition. Potential buyers should consider that no factory support exists for repairs and earpad replacement requires aftermarket solutions. Those requiring transparent-level audio performance should consider the Dan Clark Audio Aeon Closed X at 499 USD, which achieves superior measurements despite higher cost. For portable high-fidelity applications, smartphone plus external DAC/amplifier combinations often achieve superior measured performance at lower total cost than 250 USD.
