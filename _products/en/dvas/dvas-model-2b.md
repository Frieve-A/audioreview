## Overview

The DVAS Model-2B is a headphone-dedicated power amplifier using a fully differential voltage stage followed by a Darlington emitter-follower current stage. It adopts an overall no-feedback design, independent regulators per channel/stage, and a five-toroid power scheme (50VA×2 for voltage, 80VA×2 for current, plus one for control). Internal signal wiring uses Teflon-insulated solid silver conductors. Rated output is 3.5W×2 into 32Ω. Dimensions are 430×330×112mm and the weight is ~19.5kg. The build-to-order list price is 8,958 USD (converted from 1,320,000円 using the ECB reference rate as of 2025-08-25)[1][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

DVAS publishes the rated power (3.5W×2 into 32Ω) but does not disclose THD/THD+N, SNR, or crosstalk figures on its official page[1]. Meanwhile, third-party-measured competitors (e.g., TOPPING L70) demonstrate state-of-the-art transparency at a fraction of the price[2][3]. Model-2B likely provides ample headroom, but without independent measurements substantiating transparency, we assign 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The instrumentation-style fully differential front end, independent no-feedback regulators, five toroidal transformers, and a high-rigidity chassis indicate careful analog engineering[1]. However, no patents or distinctive control algorithms are publicly documented, and the approach extends mature analog practices rather than advancing the state of the art seen in measurement-driven designs. We rate 0.4.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Market price (denominator): **8,958 USD** (ECB 2025-08-25 conversion from 1,320,000円)[1][4].  
Cheapest equal-or-better comparator: **TOPPING L70, 349 USD**, with balanced outputs and independently verified transparent performance[2][3].  
Calculation: **349 USD ÷ 8,958 USD = 0.039** → rounds to **0.0**.  
L70 offers balanced 4-pin XLR/4.4mm outs, extremely low THD+N (manufacturer spec <0.000055%) and third-party verification, and up to 7.5W×2 into 32Ω—equal or better on user-relevant performance axes[2][3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

DVAS (founded in 2022) has limited long-term reliability data and an undefined global support footprint[1]. On the plus side, the product is firmware-free and uses robust mechanical construction. With warranty/parts duration not stated, we consider it average at 0.5.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Overall no-feedback amplification, multiple large transformers, and silver internal wiring drive costs but are not accompanied by third-party evidence of audible improvements[1]. Given that measurement-centric amplifiers achieve transparency inexpensively, the cost allocation appears weakly coupled to user-audible gains. We rate 0.3.

## Advice

Model-2B targets enthusiasts who value heavy-duty power supplies, elaborate chassis work, and traditional analog architectures. If your priority is verified transparency and price efficiency, third-party-measured designs like the TOPPING L70 deliver equal-or-better performance at a tiny fraction of the cost[2][3]. Should independent measurements for Model-2B be published confirming transparency, its evaluation could improve; until then, purchasing requires strong preference for craftsmanship over measurement-backed value.
