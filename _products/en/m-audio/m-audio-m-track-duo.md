## Overview

The M-Audio M-Track Duo is a 2-in/2-out USB audio interface aimed at entry-level recording, streaming, and podcasting. It features dual XLR/TRS combo inputs with M-Audio’s Crystal preamps, **16-bit/48 kHz** maximum resolution, and USB bus power. A basic software bundle is included for quick start-up. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Key specifications reach transparent-level performance for typical home-studio use. **Frequency response** for mic/line inputs and main outputs is **20 Hz–20 kHz (+0.1 dB)** (manufacturer). **SNR** is **109 dB A-weighted** at mic inputs and main outputs. **THD/THD+N**: line input **0.002%** (min gain, 0 dBu out, A-wtd), Hi-Z input **0.005%**; main outputs **0.002%** (0 dBu out, A-wtd). Additional useful numbers: **preamp EIN −128 dBu** (max gain, 40 Ω source, A-wtd); **headphone out 60 mW/ch @ 32 Ω**, SNR **100 dB A-wtd**. All values per manufacturer documentation; third-party lab data is scarce at this time. The **16-bit/48 kHz** ceiling and basic converter architecture cap the score despite meeting audibility thresholds. [2][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Conservative design prioritizes cost over innovation: 16-bit/48 kHz only, USB 2.0 (Type-B), and lightweight plastic chassis. Useful monitor-mode switching (USB / Direct Mono / Direct Stereo) is present, but there are no advanced features (auto-gain, loopback DSP, high-res 192 kHz, etc.).

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Current market price (review target): 49 USD.** [4]

To comply with equivalence, the comparator must offer **two mic preamps** with equal-or-better measured performance. The **Behringer UMC202HD** (2 mic pres, 24-bit/192 kHz; dynamic range spec **≈110 dB A-wtd**) is among the cheapest qualifying alternatives; current market price observed at **58 USD**. Because no cheaper two-preamp interface with equal-or-better performance is stably available below the Duo’s 49 USD price, the Duo is effectively the **cheapest equivalent** option at review time → **CP = 1.0**. [5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Standard limited warranty and driver support. Notable **US backorder** status at a major retailer with **estimated September 2025** shipping, which negatively affects practical availability despite generally adequate support. (Regional stock varies.) [4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Clear focus on delivering essential two-channel functionality with transparent-level basic specs at minimal cost, avoiding non-scientific claims. Rational for beginners needing **two** mic inputs without extras.

## Advice

Choose the M-Track Duo when you specifically need **two simultaneous mic inputs** at the lowest possible price while keeping transparent-level basics. If you only ever record **one** mic, a single-preamp interface can be cheaper, but that is not equivalent for CP evaluation.
