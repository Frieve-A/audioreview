## Overview

The M-Audio M-Track Solo is a 2-in/2-out USB audio interface aimed at entry-level recording, streaming, and podcasting. It offers one XLR/TRS combo input with a Crystal preamp, one instrument/line input, **16-bit/48 kHz** max resolution, and USB bus power.[1][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Using **manufacturer-stated, test-conditioned specs** as no independent full-bench reports exist yet:[1][3]

- **Frequency response (inputs)**: 20 Hz–20 kHz (+0.1 dB)  
- **SNR (A-wtd)**: 109 dB for mic input & RCA outs  
- **THD+N (A-wtd)**: mic 0.003% (min gain/0 dBu out), line 0.002%, instrument 0.005%; RCA outs 0.002%; headphones 0.02%  
- **Gain range**: combo 0–54 dB; instrument/line −10 to +44 dB

These indicate **flat FR** and **low distortion**, meeting several transparent-level thresholds; however the **16-bit ADC ceiling** constrains capture dynamic range to roughly **≈96–98 dB** (ideal quantization **SNR ≈ 6.02N + 1.76**), falling short of a **~105 dB transparent DR criterion**.[4] The **Windows default device mode** for this unit is also **2-channel, 16-bit, 48 kHz**, per the user guide.[2] Overall, this places the unit **on the transparency border**, thus **0.7**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Fundamental design: **fixed 16-bit/48 kHz**, **USB 2.0 Type-B**, lightweight housing. Provides direct monitoring and basic switching; **no** auto-gain, loopback, higher sample rates, or onboard DSP.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Review target price**: **49 USD**.[7][1]

A frequently suggested cheaper alternative, **Behringer U-Phoria UM2** (~**43.90 USD**), lists **dynamic range 100 dBA** and **FR 10 Hz–30 kHz 0/−0.5 dB**; with **unclear/absent THD+N details**, it cannot be established as **equal-or-better in measured performance** versus M-Track Solo’s ±0.1 dB FR and low-THD outputs.[5][1][3] **Behringer UMC22** is **52.90 USD** (more expensive) and is capped at **48 kHz/16-bit**, offering no clear measurement advantage.[6] Therefore, **no cheaper equal-or-better** option is confirmed; **CP hits the cap at 1.0** (will revise if future evidence appears).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Standard inMusic/M-Audio support. Class-compliant on macOS; Windows driver available. Typical reliability for this price class.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A **measurement-oriented, cost-minimized** design suited to single-mic entry-level capture. The fixed 16-bit depth limits headroom and future growth.

## Advice

If your budget is **around 50 USD** and **single-mic capture** suffices, this unit is serviceable. If possible, move up to a **24-bit interface** (e.g., Focusrite Scarlett Solo 4th Gen) for more robust dynamic range.
