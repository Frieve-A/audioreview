## Overview

The iBasso Jr. Gelato is an entry-level wired IEM featuring a 10 mm dynamic driver, detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, and stainless-steel shells. Catalog specifications commonly listed by retailers include 18 Ω impedance, 108 dB/mW sensitivity, and 20 Hz–40 kHz frequency response [1][2]. At a representative market price of 23 USD, it targets first-time buyers seeking a simple, durable IEM.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Public third-party laboratory measurements for the Gelato were not found as of the review date. Manufacturer-supplied/catalog specs reported by multiple retailers indicate: FR 20 Hz–40 kHz, impedance 18 Ω, sensitivity 108 dB/mW, THD ≤ 0.5% (at 1 kHz, when stated) [1][2]. On paper this is serviceable for casual listening but short of transparency per rigorous thresholds. With isolation and crosstalk data unpublished, and absent independent coupler measurements, the score remains provisional above the 0.5 baseline due to complete core specs and low-power drivability.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design uses a single 10 mm dynamic driver with a 0.03 mm CCAW coil and a stainless-steel chassis—solid but conventional choices for today’s budget IEMs [1][2]. Some retailer listings mention a beryllium-plated dome diaphragm; without primary documentation or patents this is treated as standard materials marketing rather than a verified innovation [1][2]. No publicly available technical whitepapers or third-party measurements substantiate unique implementation advances.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Denominator (review target price):** 23 USD.  
**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better option):** **Moondrop CHU II** at **22.99 USD** on the official site. It provides detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, FR claim with **Effective FR 20 Hz–20 kHz (IEC60318-4, −3 dB)**, **THD ≤ 0.5% (1 kHz, 94 dB)**, **impedance 18 Ω**, and **sensitivity 119 dB/Vrms**—meeting equal-or-better published performance while matching user-visible functions [3][4].  
**Calculation:** 22.99 USD ÷ 23 USD = **1.0** (rounded to the first decimal).  
Given the near-parity price and specs, cost-performance rounds to the maximum 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Warranty terms and long-term reliability data specific to the Gelato are not centrally published by the manufacturer. Retailers indicate standard coverage and typical accessory bundles; the detachable cable aids serviceability [1]. iBasso’s market presence suggests average support expectations but, in the absence of field failure data or official policy pages tied to this model, the score remains midpoint.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product emphasizes accessible drivability and robust metal housings—rational goals for durability and ease of use. Claims such as “beryllium-plated dome” and chambering appear in reseller copy but lack corroborating technical reports; without demonstrated measured gains (e.g., FR deviation, THD across level/band), these choices are treated as neutral rather than intrinsically beneficial [1][2]. No non-scientific or occult claims were found.

## Advice

If you specifically want a stainless-steel budget IEM with a detachable 2-pin cable, the Gelato is a straightforward option. However, the Moondrop CHU II provides equivalent functionality and clearer, formally stated specs (including effective FR and distortion test conditions) at essentially the same price, making it the reference choice for many buyers [3]. Prospective users of the Gelato should watch for independent measurements to confirm tuning accuracy and distortion performance; absent those data, selection should be based on availability, fit, and accessories.
