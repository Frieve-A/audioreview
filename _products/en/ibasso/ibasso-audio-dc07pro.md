## Overview

The iBasso Audio DC07PRO is a portable DAC/amp combining four Cirrus Logic CS43131 DAC chips with iBasso's proprietary FPGA technology. Supporting PCM 768kHz/32bit and DSD512, it features a 0.96-inch OLED display, ALPS encoder, and three-stage gain adjustment. Boasting measured specifications of 134dB SNR and THD+N 0.000098%, it positions itself as a high-performance device in the portable audio market at USD 199.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The balanced output measurements of THD+N 0.000098% (-120.2dB), SNR 134dB, and dynamic range 134dB demonstrate highest-level performance far exceeding transparent levels. Crosstalk specifications of 142dB (balanced) and 136dB (single-ended), along with a noise floor of 0.76μV, achieve extremely high standards scientifically valid in the audible range. The quad CS43131 configuration with FPGA technology signal processing realizes industry-leading performance in objective measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The combination of quad CS43131 DAC chips with iBasso's proprietary FPGA technology demonstrates industry-leading technical capability. Technical innovations are evident throughout, including 94% efficiency DC-DC converter achievement, 80mA low power consumption design, and adoption of ALPS high-quality encoders. The implementation of 0.96-inch OLED display and high-pass filter functionality also represents technical advancement enhancing practicality. However, basic DAC chips are off-the-shelf components, with FPGA utilization for differentiation being the primary technical element.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The DC07PRO is priced at USD 199, showing advantages compared to competitive products in the same price range. The FiiO BTR17 (USD 199, SNR 126dB, THD -120dB) directly competes at the same price, but the DC07PRO is clearly superior in performance with 134dB SNR. The Shanling UP5 (USD 179, SNR 120dB range) is approximately USD 20 cheaper but inferior in performance. Calculation: USD 179 ÷ USD 199 = 0.90, which rounds to 0.9, but considering functional and performance advantages, we score 0.7.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

iBasso Audio provides stable product supply and support systems as a manufacturer with established track record in high-quality portable audio equipment. The DC07PRO has a low failure rate with few quality issues reported in user reviews. Dedicated iBasso UAC Android APK app for device control is provided, with ongoing software support expected. High reliability is achieved through international sales network and detailed technical specification disclosure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The quad CS43131 configuration and FPGA technology utilization directly contributing to measurement performance improvements represent extremely rational design decisions. The design consistently prioritizes practicality through 94% efficiency DC-DC converter for low power consumption, ALPS encoder for improved operability, and 0.96-inch OLED display for enhanced visibility. High-pass filter functionality implementation represents practical feature addition based on scientific evidence. No unscientific sound quality improvement claims are present, with a thorough design philosophy pursuing objective measurement value improvements.

## Advice

The DC07PRO possesses highest-level performance in measurement specifications and achieves excellent cost performance in its price range. Technical advantages are clear, including exceptional measurement performance through quad CS43131 configuration, signal processing optimization via FPGA technology utilization, and extended operation through 94% efficiency DC-DC converter. Compared to the same-price FiiO BTR17 (SNR 126dB), it clearly leads in measurement performance, and while approximately USD 20 more expensive than the Shanling UP5, the performance difference justifies the price. It is strongly recommended for advanced audiophiles seeking the highest standard of measurement performance in portable environments. It would be optimal for users driving high-impedance headphones or those prioritizing objective measurement values.
