## Overview

The iBasso Jr. KLEE is an entry-level in-ear monitor (IEM) released by Chinese manufacturer iBasso Audio in February 2025. It features a 10mm dual magnetic circuit dynamic driver with a lithium-magnesium alloy diaphragm and achieves a powerful magnetic flux density of 1.6 Tesla. The housing is constructed from stainless steel with a PVD mirror finish, and includes a silver-plated oxygen-free copper Litz structure cable. In the Japanese market, it is priced at 12,375 JPY, positioning it in the relatively high-price range for entry-level products.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The measurement performance is at an appropriate level for a typical entry-level IEM. The total harmonic distortion (THD) is ≤0.5%, which does not reach the problematic level of 0.5% or higher for headphones/earphones, but also does not achieve the excellent level of 0.05% or lower. The sensitivity of 112dB allows for sufficient volume, and the impedance of 22Ω is within an easily drivable range. The frequency response range of 20Hz-40kHz is standard, but detailed measurement data from third-party organizations is lacking for flat characteristics within ±3dB in actual measurements. While the magnetic flux density of 1.6 Tesla is technically appreciable, its contribution to actual sound quality improvement has not been confirmed through measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The dual magnetic circuit design with a powerful 1.6 Tesla magnet in a 10mm dynamic driver represents a technically advanced design for the entry-level class. The adoption of a lithium-magnesium alloy diaphragm and 0.03mm CCAW voice coil shows component selection at the level of higher-end models. The machining precision of the stainless steel housing is high, and the quality of the PVD mirror finish is excellent considering the price range. The acoustic optimization through the Helmholtz resonance dual cavity system is also a design approach with a theoretical basis. However, these technologies are not industry-leading standards, but rather positioned as appropriate combinations of existing technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a product with equivalent or superior functions and performance, the QKZ x HBB Khan is available for 5,400 JPY. The QKZ x HBB Khan features a dual configuration with a 10mm bass dynamic driver and a 7.8mm mid-high frequency dynamic driver. With an impedance of 10Ω and a sensitivity of 117dB, it represents an equivalent or superior option to the iBasso Jr. KLEE in terms of fundamental acoustic performance. In a price comparison, 5,400 JPY ÷ 12,375 JPY = 0.436, showing an approximately 2.3 times price difference. This results in a cost-performance score of 0.4. While there are differences in the stainless steel housing and included cable quality, the essential differences in acoustic performance do not justify the price difference.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

iBasso Audio is a Chinese audio manufacturer established in 2006 with an established track record in the DAP and amplifier fields. In Japan, MUSIN Co., Ltd. serves as the official distributor for sales and support, with good availability on major e-commerce sites. The warranty period and repair system are considered to be at standard levels, but the long-term reliability as an emerging brand has a limited established track record. The physical durability of the stainless steel housing is highly rated, but the long-term reliability of the driver units and internal wiring requires an accumulation of usage experience.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The technology choices aimed at improving measurable acoustic characteristics are rational. The adoption of dual magnetic circuits, powerful magnets, and lightweight diaphragms represents a direction that theoretically contributes to sound quality improvement. Resonance suppression through stainless steel housing and transmission characteristic improvement through a Litz structure silver-plated cable are also scientifically grounded approaches. The interchangeable 3.5mm/4.4mm plug system is also a design that emphasizes practicality. However, as an entry-level IEM, when considering driving with general-purpose devices (smartphones), its significance as dedicated audio equipment is limited. No unscientific claims or promises of unmeasurable effects are observed, confirming a technically sound product development attitude.

## Advice

The iBasso Jr. KLEE is technically an excellent entry-level IEM, but it faces challenges in its price-to-performance ratio. It becomes an option for those who value the premium feel of the stainless steel housing and the quality of the included cable, and are willing to pay for brand value. However, when purely seeking acoustic performance, one should consider the existence of products like the QKZ x HBB Khan that achieve similar performance at approximately half the price. For first-time IEM purchases or those seeking sound quality improvement within a limited budget, we recommend considering more affordable alternatives. It is important to directly compare whether the clear acoustic advantages justify the price difference if trial opportunities are available. The true value of the iBasso Jr. KLEE should be evaluated not through comparison with other brand products in the same price range, but by its absolute performance-to-price ratio.
