summary: "A discontinued integrated amplifier from Norwegian veteran Hegel Music Systems. Despite solid measurement performance through SoundEngine technology and Class AB design, cost-performance remains poor due to alternatives achieving equivalent or better performance at significantly lower prices."

## Overview

The Hegel H80 is an integrated amplifier and DAC developed by Norwegian high-end audio manufacturer Hegel Music Systems. Featuring the company's proprietary SoundEngine technology in a Class AB design, it delivers a rated output of 75W (8Ω) while achieving 90.8W (8Ω) in actual measurements. The unit offers versatility with digital inputs (USB, optical, coaxial) and analog inputs (RCA, XLR), along with a distinctive damping factor exceeding 1000. Currently discontinued, it is only available through the used market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Third-party measurements by SoundStage show distortion characteristics with THD+N below 0.02% up to 70W and below 0.01% above 12kHz, but S/N ratio at 100dB falls short of the 105dB transparency threshold. Crosstalk is below -100dB, meeting criteria. Frequency response has rolloff below 70Hz, with -0.5dB at 10Hz, not fully achieving ±0.5dB across 20Hz-20kHz. Damping factor exceeds 1000 between 100Hz-4kHz, indicating good speaker control. Overall, measurements partially meet transparency standards but do not fully clear all indicators for scientifically valid audible improvements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Hegel's proprietary SoundEngine technology maintains Class A advantages while reducing Class AB crossover distortion. Measured output of 90.8W (8Ω) and 135.8W (4Ω) exceeds specifications, with damping factor above 1000 showing solid implementation. Integrated digital and analog circuits handle USB, optical, and coaxial inputs via internal DAC. However, the core circuit is standard Class AB with limited innovation. From current standards, this is slightly above industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The Fosi Audio ZA3 (approximately 150 USD) offers equivalent or superior functionality and performance. With up to 90W (8Ω) output using 48V PSU, THD below 0.006%, S/N ratio above 106dB, it meets or exceeds H80 measurements. It includes RCA, XLR inputs, digital processing via TPA3255 chip, subwoofer out, and mono mode, matching features. Against H80's original price of 2000 USD, 150 USD ÷ 2000 USD = 0.075 shows equivalent performance at 7.5% of the price, indicating poor cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Hegel, founded in 1988, has established reliability as a Norwegian audio manufacturer. The simple Class AB design suggests low failure risk. However, discontinuation limits new purchases and long-term support. Distance from Norway may constrain support in Japan. Overall, reliability is slightly above average, but discontinuation reduces the score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The SoundEngine-enhanced Class AB approach is theoretically rational, with measurable benefits like high damping and low distortion. Digital integration addresses modern sources. However, equivalent or better performance via Class D designs is now achievable at far lower costs, severely diminishing the necessity for high-priced Class AB dedicated equipment. Products like Fosi Audio ZA3 offer similar features and superior metrics at a fraction of the price, highlighting limited rationality in market positioning and adherence to outdated topologies.

## Advice

The Hegel H80 shows solid measurements, but discontinuation prevents new purchases. For used market considerations, note that current products like Fosi Audio ZA3 provide equivalent or superior performance (THD 0.006%, S/N 106dB) at approximately 150 USD, making it a rational choice. Objective advantages beyond brand are hard to find. Prioritize budget with Fosi Audio ZA3 or explore latest technologies in other products.
