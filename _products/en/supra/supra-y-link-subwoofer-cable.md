## Overview

The Supra Y-Link Subwoofer Cable is a specialized audio interconnect designed to split a single mono LFE channel into two identical mono signals for subwoofers with dual RCA inputs. Manufactured by Swedish company Jenving Technology AB under the Supra Cables brand, the cable features 24K gold-plated connectors, PTFE insulation, and aluminized PET foil shielding. The company emphasizes their "No-Nonsense Design" philosophy focused on engineering-based cable construction rather than subjective approaches.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The cable's electrical specifications show resistance (72 Ohm/km) and capacitance (52 pF/m) within acceptable ranges for audio applications [4]. While no independent third-party measurements exist specifically for the Y-Link model, the manufacturer specifications indicate basic cable performance without demonstrated problems. Per policy guidance for basic cable products, this receives a baseline score reflecting adequate performance for transparent audio transmission in typical applications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Y-Link employs conventional analog cable construction without proprietary patents or cutting-edge technology. Construction uses standard materials including 5N oxygen-free copper conductors, PTFE insulation, and PET foil shielding. The cable represents established cable manufacturing practices without technical innovation beyond industry norms. The analog-only design approach and absence of proprietary technology result in below-average technology level scoring.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The Supra Y-Link currently sells for approximately 85 USD in the US market. Equipped with 1 RCA Male to 2 RCA Male Y-adapter configuration and 24K gold-plated connectors, alternative RCA Y-adapters are available. The FosPower RCA Y-Adapter offers equivalent functionality with 24K gold-plated connectors and dual shielding at approximately 12 USD [2]. Both products provide basic Y-adapter signal splitting with gold-plated connectors and equivalent user-facing functions. CP = 12 USD รท 85 USD = 0.14, rounded to 0.2.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The cable features simple, robust construction with minimal failure points. Gold-plated connectors and quality materials suggest good long-term durability. Swedish manufacturing by Jenving Technology AB provides quality control with batch number traceability. Support infrastructure operates primarily through authorized dealers rather than direct manufacturer support. The straightforward cable design with few components contributes to inherent reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Supra emphasizes their "No-Nonsense Design" philosophy focused on engineering-based cable construction and measurement validation [3]. The company demonstrates scientific approach through collaboration with Swedish universities and measurement-focused development. The philosophy prioritizes objective performance over subjective claims, representing rational cable design methodology. Swedish engineering heritage and manufacturing quality control contribute to systematic approach toward transparent audio transmission, despite premium pricing for basic functionality.

## Advice

The Supra Y-Link functions adequately as a subwoofer signal splitter but provides limited value at current US market pricing of approximately 85 USD. For budget-conscious installations, consider standard RCA Y-adapters from established brands like FosPower at significantly lower cost (approximately 12 USD). While the Supra offers Swedish manufacturing and quality materials, the premium pricing is difficult to justify for basic signal splitting applications where transparent transmission is the primary requirement. The cable's construction quality may appeal to users prioritizing brand heritage, but functional equivalents are available at substantially lower cost.
