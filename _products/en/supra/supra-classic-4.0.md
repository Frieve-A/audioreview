## Overview

The Supra Classic 4.0 is a 2x4.0 mm² (11 AWG) speaker cable manufactured by Swedish company Jenving Technology AB under the Supra Cables brand. Established in 1976, Supra pioneered the dedicated speaker cable market when most systems used basic electrical cords. The Classic 4.0 features tin-plated oxygen-free copper (OFC) conductors with 5N purity (>99.999% pure), multi-stranded construction with 511 strands per conductor, and ion-stable PVC insulation. Designed for high-power systems or longer cable runs in medium-power applications, it represents conventional cable technology with quality materials but commands premium pricing in the current market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For cables, evaluation follows the framework for products with no scientifically audible impact. As a basic speaker cable without extraordinary performance claims, the base score of 0.5 applies with deductions only for confirmed specification violations. Available measurements show resistance of 4.3 Ohm/km and inductance of 0.55 µH/m within normal specifications for 4.0 mm² cable. Third-party Alpha Audio measurements indicate good electrical properties with 2 μH inductance for a 4-meter sample [1]. While a slight frequency response variation at 20 kHz was noted in testing [1], this falls within normal cable behavior and does not represent a specification violation requiring score deduction.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Classic 4.0 represents conventional speaker cable technology using established materials and construction methods. While 5N purity OFC and tin plating are quality features, they do not constitute cutting-edge or proprietary technology. The multi-stranded design with 511 strands per conductor provides flexibility but uses mature technology widely available in the market. Ion-stable PVC insulation offers durability benefits but represents standard cable engineering rather than innovation. The design lacks proprietary patents, uses only mature/outdated technology, and follows analog/mechanical-only construction without modern integration of digital technologies or innovative cost-reduction approaches.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Current US market research shows the Supra Classic 4.0 priced at approximately 10 USD per meter based on Madisound Speaker Store pricing converted from per-foot rates. Comparison analysis identified Van Damme 2 core x 4mm speaker cable at £6.01 per meter (approximately 7.61 USD per meter using exchange rate USD 1.00 = GBP 0.79 [3]) as an equivalent alternative [2]. The Van Damme cable shows 4.60 Ohm/km resistance compared to Supra's 4.3 Ohm/km resistance, representing a 7% difference which falls within normal cable variance tolerances for electrical performance comparison. Equipped with equivalent 4mm cross-section and similar electrical characteristics, both cables provide comparable performance for high-power applications. CP = 7.61 USD ÷ 10 USD = 0.8.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Supra Cables operates through Jenving Technology AB with over 40 years of experience in cable manufacturing. The company maintains quality certifications including military standards, with soldering teams holding Military Quality Standards certification. Simple cable construction with ion-stable PVC insulation and tin-plated conductors provides inherent durability and resistance to degradation. The company supplies to military and aerospace applications including Swedish and American air forces, indicating robust quality control processes. Global support infrastructure exists through established distribution networks. However, standard warranty periods and typical support duration limit higher scoring in this category.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Supra's "No-Nonsense-Design" philosophy emphasizes engineering over marketing claims, stating their cables are "based on real engineering and not voodoo," demonstrating a scientific approach that aligns with rational design principles. Costs directly contribute to function and performance improvement through quality materials and construction. However, the design represents conservative rather than innovative approaches to cable construction. While engineering is sound, the traditional multi-stranded OFC design with tin plating does not represent cutting-edge cost optimization or innovative solutions that significantly advance cable performance beyond established industry standards.

## Advice

The Supra Classic 4.0 offers solid engineering and build quality with materials appropriate for high-power applications. Current market analysis shows comparable alternatives like Van Damme 2 core x 4mm available at lower cost with similar electrical performance. While the Supra cable provides quality construction and established Swedish manufacturing heritage, users seeking optimal cost-performance may find better value in alternative products. The Classic 4.0 remains suitable for users specifically prioritizing the brand heritage and particular resistance characteristics, though the cost premium requires consideration against functionally equivalent alternatives.
