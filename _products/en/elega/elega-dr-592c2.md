## Overview

The ELEGA DR-592C2 is a vintage dynamic headphone manufactured by Fujiki Electric Co. Ltd. in the 1970s, originally designed for professional monitoring applications including DTM (Desktop Music) and voice chat. Featuring a 20Hz-20kHz frequency response, 110dB sensitivity, and 100mW maximum input capability, these headphones represent 1970s audio engineering with full metal construction including brass arms with nickel plating and a distinctive flat spring headband design. Currently rare on the second-hand market, they are positioned as vintage audio collectibles despite lacking any functional advantages over modern alternatives.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. The available specifications include only basic parameters such as frequency response (20Hz-20kHz), sensitivity (110dB), and maximum input (100mW) without critical performance metrics including THD, S/N ratio, sound isolation measurements, or other audio quality indicators defined in professional measurement standards. No credible third-party measurements are available for this vintage product, making objective audio performance assessment impossible. According to evaluation framework guidelines, when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 with explicit acknowledgment that evaluation cannot be performed due to insufficient data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The ELEGA DR-592C2 represents basic 1970s dynamic headphone technology with conventional metal construction and flat spring headband design. While demonstrating solid mechanical engineering for its era with in-house design by Fujiki Electric, the technology completely lacks modern innovations, proprietary technological advancements, or integration of digital/software technologies that characterize contemporary professional monitoring equipment. The analog-only approach, significantly outdated technology from the 1970s, and easily replicable vintage construction methods result in technology that is no longer desirable or competitive. No patents, cutting-edge implementations, or technical sophistication distinguishes this product from basic dynamic headphone designs available throughout the audio industry.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Cost-performance evaluation cannot be conducted as the ELEGA DR-592C2 is not currently available for purchase at any verifiable market price. Investigation found no current market listings, vendor availability, or verified pricing for new units in 2025. While historically priced around 195 USD equivalent, the product appears to be discontinued with extremely limited availability even on vintage audio markets. Multiple modern professional monitoring headphones with equivalent or superior specifications are readily available: Audio-Technica ATH-M20x (59 USD, 15Hz-20kHz frequency response, 96dB sensitivity) and Sony MDR-7506 (109.99 USD, 10Hz-20kHz frequency response, 106dB sensitivity) both provide professional monitoring functionality with active manufacturer support and warranty coverage. Cost-performance is set to 0.5 with explicit acknowledgment that evaluation cannot be performed due to fundamental inability to purchase the review target product.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The ELEGA DR-592C2 offers no manufacturer warranty or support infrastructure, as Fujiki Electric Co. ceased operations decades ago. While the simple metal construction with brass arms and spring headband design suggests inherent durability with minimal electronic failure points, any repairs must be handled exclusively through vintage audio specialists rather than manufacturer support channels. The robust mechanical design provides some reliability advantages, but the complete absence of manufacturer warranty (vintage product), ended support duration, third-party-only repair infrastructure, and lack of global support systems significantly compromise the reliability and support proposition compared to contemporary products with active manufacturer backing.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the original 1970s design philosophy focused on professional monitoring applications with business-grade construction, the complete absence of product availability makes any design philosophy evaluation largely academic. The historical 195 USD pricing for 1970s technology with no functional advantages over modern 59-109 USD alternatives demonstrated fundamentally irrational cost optimization and complete lack of performance progression. The analog-only approach lacks integration of cutting-edge technologies, DSP capabilities, or software features that could justify dedicated audio equipment existence. The conservative 1970s design philosophy showed no innovation attitude or adoption of contemporary technologies that could provide competitive advantages. Current discontinuation and market unavailability represent the logical conclusion of a product design philosophy that failed to evolve with technological advancement or maintain cost-competitive positioning.

## Advice

The ELEGA DR-592C2 cannot be recommended for purchase as it is not currently available through any verifiable market channels. Investigation found no current vendor listings, manufacturer availability, or verified pricing in 2025. For professional monitoring applications, modern alternatives such as the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x (59 USD) or Sony MDR-7506 (109.99 USD) provide equivalent or superior functionality with active manufacturer support, warranty coverage, and readily available replacement parts. These alternatives offer comparable or improved frequency response ranges, professional-grade construction, and proven reliability standards. Collectors seeking vintage audio equipment should note that even on specialized vintage markets, the DR-592C2 appears extremely rare with questionable availability. No objective advantages exist to justify pursuing this discontinued product over contemporary professional monitoring alternatives with superior support infrastructure and guaranteed availability.
