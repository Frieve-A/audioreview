## Overview

The Korg DS-DAC-10R is a DAC/ADC combo device primarily designed for digitally archiving analog records. Released in 2015, this unit integrates a phono preamplifier, DAC, ADC, and headphone amplifier into a single box, supporting high-resolution recording and playback up to DSD 5.6MHz. It features a Cirrus Logic CS4398 DAC and a Texas Instruments PCM4202 ADC, and is designed to work in conjunction with the dedicated "AudioGate 4" software. Its beautifully designed chassis is also a notable feature.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

This unit's official specifications boast excellent figures of a 105dB Signal-to-Noise Ratio and 0.005% THD+N, both of which clear the "transparent level" in our evaluation criteria. The frequency response is also good at 10Hz-20kHz (Â±1dB), indicating a high level of fidelity to the master source. Although the installed CS4398 DAC chip is an older design, its high performance is extracted through proper implementation. While detailed measurements for the phono preamp section are unavailable, the published specs for the line I/O are scientifically valid. The audible superiority of the DSD format over PCM is not scientifically established, but based on its measurement performance, this device deserves a high rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The integrated design, which houses a phono preamp, ADC, and DAC in one box and supports DSD recording, is technically commendable. Looking at the individual components, the CS4398 DAC and PCM4202 ADC were high-performance at the time of their release but are now considered standard. However, its support for five different phono equalizer curves in addition to the RIAA curve is a noteworthy technical feature for accurately reproducing older records. While no groundbreaking proprietary technology is observed, it is a solid design optimized for a specific purpose, surpassing the industry average technical level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This device is a unique product in the market as a current USB-DAC/ADC that combines a phono input (MM cartridge compatible) with DSD recording functionality. Our research found no alternative products, either single or in combination, that can achieve all these features and equivalent or better performance at a lower price. Although it is a niche product category, because there is no cheaper option for the unique value it provides to the user, its cost-performance is rated a perfect 1.0 based on our policy.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As an electronic musical instrument manufacturer founded in 1963, Korg has a long track record and stable corporate reliability. Although some time has passed since this product's release, it is still in production and being sold. Support continues, with updates to the dedicated software "AudioGate" provided as recently as February 2025. The warranty period is a standard one year, and the support system is well-established. While not exclusively an audio manufacturer, their quality control, cultivated through instrument manufacturing, is respectable, and we judge that they ensure industry-average reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design, specialized for the clear purpose of "easily digitizing analog records with high quality," is highly rational. The approach of integrating necessary functions into a single unit and enhancing usability with dedicated software is logical. Support for various phono equalizer curves is also a rational decision for the purpose of archiving. Furthermore, the official publication of performance specifications can be commended as a scientific approach. While one could argue that a combination of general-purpose devices could be an alternative if one is not particular about DSD recording, the unique functions and convenience offered by this unit give it a sufficiently rational reason for its existence.

## Advice

For those who want to digitally archive their analog records in the high-quality DSD format, this product is arguably the only choice on the market today. Since the phono preamp and DSD-compatible ADC are integrated, you can build a simple system and enjoy comfortable operation with the dedicated software.

The multi-function phono equalizer is of great value, especially for those who own old records with equalizer curves other than the standard RIAA.

On the other hand, if you are not particular about DSD recording and simply want to digitize your records, you can save costs by combining a cheaper USB audio interface and a phono preamp. This product is an excellent solution for specific users who find value in its unique features.
