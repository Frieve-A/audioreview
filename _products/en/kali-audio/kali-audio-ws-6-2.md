## Overview

The WS-6.2 is a compact powered studio subwoofer using two horizontally opposed 6.5-inch high-excursion woofers (15 mm p-p), a Class-D amplifier (400 W continuous / 1000 W peak), and a low-noise **front** port. Kali rates frequency range at 31.5–180 Hz (±3 dB), extension to 27 Hz (-10 dB), and 120 dB peak SPL at 1 m. I/O includes balanced XLR/TRS, RCA, an 80 Hz HPF output, polarity switch, and footswitch bypass. All are manufacturer specifications. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

From manufacturer data: 31.5–180 Hz (±3 dB), 27–200 Hz (-10 dB), and max SPL 120 dB (peak @1 m) with system THD <2% at 90 dB SPL (1 m). These figures are adequate for nearfield monitoring, and the opposed-driver layout reduces cabinet reaction force, limiting vibration transmission. However, with only manufacturer-published THD and no independent distortion plots, we set a conservative score. Overall, bandwidth within the intended use band and output capability are solid, but the lack of third-party measurements prevents a higher rating. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Technically thoughtful execution: opposed 6.5-inch drivers to cancel net vibration, custom excursion spec (15 mm p-p), limiter, polarity switch, selectable crossover (80 Hz/LFE/external), and a **low-noise front port** designed to mitigate turbulence. Integration features are complete for small studio workflows. This is above industry-average implementation for a compact sub at this price, though not groundbreaking. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Market price: **599 USD**. The **Mackie MRS10** is the **cheapest equal-or-better alternative** we could confirm: max SPL **119 dB** (within ~1 dB of WS-6.2’s 120 dB) and extension to **28 Hz (-10 dB)**, with comparable balanced I/O and variable crossover—thus equivalent for typical studio use. Current US price observed at **449.99 USD**.  
**Calculation**: 449.99 USD ÷ 599 USD = **0.75** → rounded to **0.8**. [3][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Kali provides a **1-year limited warranty** (manual and website). Construction is straightforward (Class-D amp, MDF, front-ported cabinet) and includes protective limiting. Dealer support is typical; no firmware concerns for this category. The short warranty relative to some competitors keeps this item at an average score. [1][5]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Kali’s approach emphasizes measurable, practical improvements: compact footprint, vibration-canceling opposed woofers, and a low-noise port to reduce chuffing—features with direct, audible benefits in small rooms. Marketing claims are tied to technical mechanisms and standard integration options; no occult audio. [1][2]

## Advice

Choose the WS-6.2 when you need under-desk placement, minimized mechanical vibration, and straightforward integration with 80 Hz HPF outputs. In small control rooms or edit suites, one unit should cover reference levels; for larger rooms or higher SPL margins, consider dual WS-6.2 or a larger sub. If maximum value is paramount and you can accommodate a larger box, **Mackie MRS10** offers near-equivalent extension/output for less. If you need club-voiced XLF mode and accept lower peak SPL, **JBL LSR310S** remains a budget option (27 Hz extension, ~113 dB peak). [3][4][6][7]
