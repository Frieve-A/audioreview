## Overview

The Kali Audio IN-8 V2 is an 8-inch 3-way powered studio monitor launched by California-based Kali Audio, founded in 2018. This tri-amped coaxial design features an 8" paper woofer, 4" optimized profile paper midrange, and 1" textile dome tweeter with the midrange and tweeter forming an acoustic point source. The V2 iteration includes improved Class D amplification with 12dB noise reduction, upgraded DSP processing, and enhanced transducers for better reliability. The monitor delivers 140W total power (60W LF, 40W Mid, 40W HF) with frequency response of 37 Hz - 25 kHz (±10 dB) and maximum SPL of 117 dB.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Based on available measured data from third-party sources [2], the IN-8 V2 demonstrates performance between problematic and transparent levels across key metrics. Frequency response achieves 45 Hz - 21 kHz (±3 dB), meeting standard level but not excellent (±1 dB) criteria. Harmonic distortion measurements from independent testing show performance at 86dB and 96dB @ 1m with the monitor exhibiting slight resonance around 160Hz and potential peak in 4-5kHz region [2]. Maximum SPL of 117 dB provides adequate headroom for near/mid-field monitoring applications. The measured performance consistently falls in the middle range without reaching transparent level criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The IN-8 V2 demonstrates significant technical sophistication through its proprietary coaxial design where the 4-inch midrange driver houses a 1-inch tweeter at its center, creating an acoustic point source with hyper-realistic imaging capabilities. This custom configuration limits midrange excursion to less than 1mm peak-to-peak to prevent interference with tweeter operation. The V2 iteration features upgraded Class D tri-amplification with 12dB noise reduction compared to the original model, plus enhanced DSP processing for more precise tuning and new boundary EQ settings. Crossover implementation at 280Hz (LF to mid) and 2.8kHz (mid to HF) utilizes advanced digital processing. The coaxial point-source design represents technology that other manufacturers would want to adopt, demonstrating high accumulation of acoustic engineering know-how and innovative approach to driver integration.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The IN-8 V2 at 449 USD per monitor demonstrates good cost-performance when compared against equivalent 8-inch powered studio monitors. The Yamaha HS8 provides comparable user-facing functionality with 8-inch woofer, powered bi-amp design, similar frequency response (47Hz-24kHz), XLR/TRS connectivity, and room control features, available at approximately 350 USD per monitor [3]. While the IN-8 V2 offers advanced coaxial design and 3-way configuration, the cost-performance calculation focuses on essential monitoring functions and measured performance rather than internal driver arrangements. CP = 350 USD ÷ 449 USD = 0.78. Other comparable alternatives include the JBL LSR308 (37Hz-24kHz, 112W) and PreSonus Eris E8 XT (35Hz-22kHz, 140W), both offering equivalent monitoring capabilities at lower price points than the IN-8 V2.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The IN-8 V2 receives below-average evaluation due to limited warranty coverage compared to industry standards. Kali Audio provides 1-year limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship, falling short of the typical 2-year coverage offered by established manufacturers. Customer support operates through online and phone channels with 30-day return window including 15% restocking fee [1]. The product features relatively simple construction with Class D amplification and DSP processing, but lacks extended support programs or special reliability features found in professional monitor lines. As a relatively new company founded in 2018, long-term reliability data remains limited compared to established manufacturers with decades of track records.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Kali Audio demonstrates highly rational design philosophy focused on engineering excellence and value optimization. Founded in 2018 with core mission to "make loudspeakers that present the best possible value," the company emphasizes research and development over marketing claims. The IN-8 V2 embodies scientific approach through measurement-focused acoustic design, modern Class D amplification adoption for efficiency, and DSP integration for precise tuning capabilities. Cost allocation directly contributes to functional and performance improvements rather than meaningless premium materials or aesthetics. The innovative coaxial implementation addresses real acoustic challenges while maintaining accessible pricing through intelligent engineering choices. Company philosophy prioritizes cutting-edge technology adoption (DSP, Class D) and active cost reduction relative to performance, avoiding audio industry myths and subjective claims in favor of measurable improvements.

## Advice

For mixing and mastering professionals specifically requiring coaxial point-source design, the IN-8 V2 offers unique functionality at 449 USD, though traditional 2-way monitors like the Yamaha HS8 provide equivalent monitoring capabilities at moderately lower cost. The innovative coaxial configuration delivers superior imaging and acoustic coherence compared to conventional designs, making it suitable for users who prioritize point-source characteristics over cost savings. However, budget-conscious buyers should consider the Yamaha HS8 or JBL LSR308 as cost-effective alternatives that deliver comparable monitoring performance. The limited 1-year warranty requires consideration for long-term ownership costs. Near/mid-field applications within 1-3 meters maximize the coaxial design benefits, though the slight resonance at 160Hz and potential 4-5kHz peak should be factored into acoustic treatment planning.
