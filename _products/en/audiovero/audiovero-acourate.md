## Overview

Developed by AudioVero e.K., Acourate is a high-precision room correction and speaker measurement software by Dr. Ulrich Brüggemann. It achieves precision far exceeding conventional hardware DSP solutions with its 131,072-tap high-resolution FIR filter generation (0.34Hz resolution). Key features include phase correction via proprietary Inter-Channel Phase Alignment (ICPA) technology, 64-bit processing, and support for sampling rates up to 512kHz. It is an industry-standard tool recommended by renowned mastering engineers like Bob Katz and Dominique Bassal. The current price is €416.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Acourate's scientific validity is extremely high. The software has established an industry-standard methodology for high-precision room correction based on FIR filters and time-domain analysis. Its superiority has been demonstrated not only by measurement data (frequency response, impulse response, etc.) but also through blind listening tests by professionals like Bob Katz. The Inter-Channel Phase Alignment (ICPA) feature, which corrects inter-channel phase differences, is also a scientifically rational function based on psychoacoustic principles. The entire workflow, from measurement to filter generation, is built on a consistent scientific foundation. The software's capabilities, such as correcting linear and minimum phase distortions and calculating target curves based on psychoacoustic models, are all supported by solid research.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The software is designed with cutting-edge acoustic engineering. The 131,072-tap FIR filter processing remains at the industry's highest standard, and the Inter-Channel Phase Alignment (ICPA) technology for synchronizing left and right channels is highly unique. The 64-bit processing and 512kHz support are appropriate high-end specifications. The design philosophy, reflecting Dr. Brüggemann's acoustic theories and experience from the TacT forum, is also commendable. However, it lacks the latest AI and machine learning-based auto-optimization features, leaving room for improvement from a modern software engineering perspective. The manual-configuration-premised operating system is also conservative from a technological advancement standpoint.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The direct competitor for this product is Juice Hifi's Audiolense XO (€370), which also features high-precision FIR filter correction and time-domain correction. Calculating the value for money based on our review policy gives `CP = €370 ÷ €416 ≒ 0.89`, placing it in a nearly identical price range. Acourate's proprietary ICPA feature is the key factor in determining whether the price difference is justified. While free alternatives (REW, rePhase, etc.) exist, their functionalities are fragmented, and they do not offer an integrated workflow, advanced automation, or support. Considering its functionality as a professional tool, the product's pricing is reasonable.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Its reliability is highly rated due to its long track record as an industry-standard software and its use in mastering studios. The software's stability is reported as problem-free in multiple long-term use reports, and no digital artifacts have been confirmed. Continuous updates from AudioVero e.K. (confirmed up to v3.1) and active support forums on Audiophile Style and the Roon Labs community are also points in its favor. However, as it is developed by a small German company, there are limitations to the support system corresponding to the company's size. Support is primarily in German and English.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

It adopts an acoustically rational approach. Linear phase correction with FIR filters, simultaneous optimization in time and frequency domains, and achieving psychoacoustic flatness are scientifically sound. High precision through hardware-independent software processing is also a modern approach. However, the complex operating system, which assumes manual configuration, presents efficiency challenges compared to modern AI-assisted or one-click automation technologies. Possible technical improvements like GUI enhancements for better usability and the inclusion of beginner-friendly preset functions are not yet implemented. While the philosophy as a professional tool is understandable, it is a conservative design from a cost-efficiency perspective.

## Advice

Acourate is a software at the pinnacle of acoustic correction technology, ideal for professionals and dedicated audiophiles seeking the highest standard of correction. When considering a purchase, you should compare it with its direct competitor, Audiolense XO, and decide based on whether you find value in its unique ICPA feature and user interface. For those wanting to try basic room correction, starting with the free combination of REW and rePhase is an option, but for an integrated environment and advanced features, this product is a strong contender. The learning curve is steep, but mastering it can yield unparalleled results.

## Supplementary Information

Learning this software requires a significant time investment and assumes a basic knowledge of acoustics. Additionally, a measurement microphone (recommended: Dayton Audio EMM-6, etc.) and a measurement environment must be set up separately. The license is a one-time purchase, and updates may be paid. It can be integrated with major player software such as Roon, JRiver, and foobar2000.
