## Overview

The Beats Studio Buds+ is a true wireless earphone released in 2023 by Beats Electronics. It achieves 1.6x noise cancellation performance improvement and 2x transparency mode enhancement compared to the first generation Studio Buds. Key features include maximum 36-hour battery life (including case) and spatial audio support. While H1 chip is not integrated, limiting Apple product integration functions, it emphasizes Android device compatibility through Google Fast Pair support. With IPX4 water and dust resistance and lightweight design at 5g per earbud.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Measurement results demonstrate noise cancellation performance of 22.6dB for train sounds (1-4kHz), 26.6dB for bicycle bells (high frequency), and 24.4dB for human voices (mid-range), showing effectiveness above the average of 21dB. Frequency characteristics are well-balanced across all ranges, achieving uniform acoustic distribution rather than bass-heavy tuning. Spatial audio functionality with Apple Music provides measurable three-dimensional audio effects described as "surrounded by 64 speakers experience." However, detailed measurement data for transparency levels (THD below 0.01%, SNR above 105dB) is not publicly available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Technical progress achieved with 1.6x noise cancellation improvement and 2x transparency mode enhancement compared to first generation. Bluetooth 5.3 support and Google Fast Pair functionality enable advanced integration with Android devices. Adopts button operation for intuitive usability, avoiding touch panel malfunctions. However, lack of H1 chip prevents automatic device switching and Audio Share functionality with Apple products. Basic acoustic technology remains at industry standard levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Studio Buds+ is priced at 18,882 yen. Compared to equivalent performance Soundcore Liberty 4 NC (10,999 yen, 20Hz-20kHz support, active noise cancellation, multipoint connection, IPX4 water resistance, maximum 50-hour battery), CP = 10,999 yen รท 18,882 yen = 0.58. Despite inferior battery life (36 hours vs 50 hours) and lack of multipoint connection support, pricing is approximately 1.7 times higher. Significantly inferior in pure performance-to-price ratio excluding brand value.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Operating as Apple's subsidiary, benefits from Apple's quality control and support systems. Through global sales networks and service systems, comprehensive support is provided domestically in Japan. Product quality control adheres to Apple's standards, enabling expectations of long-term stability. Systems for rapid firmware updates and bug fixes are established.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Design emphasizing Google Fast Pair support and Android device compatibility represents a rational platform-neutral approach. Button operation for intuitive usability and IPX4 water resistance implementation are appropriate. 36-hour battery life provides practical value. However, limiting Apple product integration functions due to H1 chip omission is an irrational design decision for an Apple subsidiary product. Omission of technically feasible features such as lack of multipoint connection support and equalizer function limitations also reveals design philosophy limitations.

## Advice

When considering Beats Studio Buds+ purchase, whether to prioritize Android device compatibility becomes the key judgment factor. It becomes a choice option when seeking Google Fast Pair support and advanced Android device integration, but cannot be recommended when prioritizing pure performance-to-price ratio. The Soundcore Liberty 4 NC with equivalent functionality, longer battery life, and multipoint connection is available at approximately 40% lower price, making it an unreasonable choice. Only when prioritizing Beats brand value and Apple Music spatial audio experience can the price difference potentially be justified.
