## Overview

The Dayton Audio T652-AIR is a budget tower speaker from Dayton Audio, the private brand of Parts Express in the United States. It features a 2-way design with dual 6.5-inch woofers and a 1-inch AMT (Air Motion Transformer) tweeter. Standing 30 inches tall, it is designed to offer a full-scale tower speaker experience at an entry-level price point, with a US market price of approximately 125 USD per pair.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While the nominal frequency response is 45Hz-20kHz, measurements reveal several peaks and dips, particularly a noticeable drop in the crossover region between the tweeter and woofer. The bass has presence, but at high volumes, distortion increases and port noise can become an issue. The sensitivity is 88dB (1W/1m), which is a standard level drivable by typical amplifiers. According to speaker measurement standards, this model has issues with frequency response flatness and distortion, and cannot be described as providing transparent sound quality.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Incorporating an AMT tweeter at this price point and using a dual-woofer configuration to secure efficiency and low-frequency reproduction is a commendable technical effort within cost constraints. An AMT tweeter is a technology that can be expected to offer fast response and low distortion due to its structure. However, the crossover design and cabinet rigidity, which are crucial for maximizing its potential, remain at a standard level commensurate with the price.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Based on its US market price of approximately 125 USD per pair, this product is an extremely low-cost tower speaker. It is difficult to find another tower speaker with comparable size and nominal specs at a lower price in that market. For instance, its price advantage is overwhelming when compared to other highly-regarded entry-level towers like the Sony SS-CS3 (around 300 USD per pair). While its measured performance has limitations, its pricing is world-class for the functionality provided as a tower speaker, thus earning the highest cost-performance rating. It's important to note that prices outside the US, such as in Japan, are considerably higher due to import and distribution costs.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a private brand of Parts Express, Dayton Audio has a certain level of reliability, but it is positioned as a relatively new manufacturer. The warranty and support systems are at the industry-standard level, but long-term reliability data is limited. Parts supply and repair services are provided through the Parts Express sales network, but global support is limited. As a budget product, its long-term durability remains uncertain.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The aim to provide a floor-standing experience at a low cost is ambitious. However, since overall acoustic performance heavily depends on fundamental elements like the cabinet and crossover network, this "one-point luxury" approach of adopting a specific tweeter has its rational limits. A combination of bookshelf speakers and a subwoofer could likely achieve higher fidelity playback in the same price range, making the necessity of the tower format limited to ease of installation and visual simplicity.

## Advice

The fact that you can get a pair of tower speakers for around 125 USD in the US market is a major attraction. While sufficient sound pressure is secured by the dual woofers, there are limitations to the high-frequency quality and overall sound accuracy that are commensurate with the price. The uneven frequency response and distortion at high volumes can be perceived as drawbacks, especially when listening to music carefully. For those seeking higher sound quality, considering a pair of well-regarded bookshelf speakers within the same budget, with the option to add a subwoofer later, may lead to a more satisfying result.
