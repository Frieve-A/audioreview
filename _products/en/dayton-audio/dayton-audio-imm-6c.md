## Overview

The Dayton Audio IMM-6C represents the latest evolution in affordable calibrated measurement microphones, featuring USB-C connectivity optimized for modern mobile devices and computers. Building upon the success of the original IMM-6, this model integrates a CM6542 ADC/DAC for digital audio processing while maintaining individual laboratory-standard calibration. At under 45 USD, it targets users seeking measurement-grade accuracy without the premium pricing of professional alternatives.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The IMM-6C delivers adequate measurement performance with its 6mm electret condenser capsule providing 18–20,000 Hz frequency response within ±0.5 dB when used with its individual calibration file [1][2]. With the calibration file applied, third-party testing shows the frequency response meets IEC 61672 Class I limits [1]. The integrated CM6542 ADC is specified at 0.001% THD+N [2]. Self-noise was measured at 26.6 dB-A in controlled conditions by an independent lab [1], and the manufacturer specifies a 70 dB A-weighted signal-to-noise ratio (host dependent) [2], which falls below the 105 dB transparent threshold and approaches the 80 dB problematic level, potentially limiting precision in very quiet environments. The omnidirectional polar response ensures consistent spatial measurements, while the individual serialized calibration provides laboratory-grade accuracy correction [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design employs established electret condenser technology with competent digital integration. The CM6542 ADC/DAC implementation enables direct USB-C connectivity, eliminating analog interface limitations. The innovative kickstand design incorporates a 3.5mm analog output for signal generation, creating an all-in-one measurement solution. While the underlying microphone capsule technology is conventional, the integration approach and USB-C implementation represent solid engineering for the price point. The individual calibration process using laboratory-standard references demonstrates commitment to measurement accuracy.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 44.98 USD, the IMM-6C establishes exceptional value in the calibrated measurement microphone category [3]. No cheaper equivalent-or-better calibrated USB measurement microphone with individual calibration and broad software compatibility was identified at review time. The closest equivalent comparator is the miniDSP UMIK-1 at 79 USD [4]. Because no cheaper equivalent exists, CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Dayton Audio provides standard manufacturer warranty coverage with established customer support infrastructure. As a relatively new product, extensive reliability data remains limited. Software support relies on third-party measurement applications rather than proprietary solutions, ensuring broad compatibility but potentially inconsistent user experience across platforms. The digital interface eliminates analog connection reliability concerns while introducing dependency on USB-C port integrity.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates strong scientific rationality by prioritizing measurement accuracy through individual calibration at an accessible price point. The USB-C interface addresses modern device compatibility requirements while the integrated ADC/DAC eliminates analog interface variables. The inclusion of analog output capability via the kickstand design enables complete measurement workflows without additional equipment. This approach rationally serves the growing market of mobile-based acoustic measurement while maintaining scientific measurement standards. The focus on calibrated accuracy over premium materials represents sound engineering priorities for measurement applications.

## Advice

For users requiring calibrated measurement capabilities with modern USB-C devices, the IMM-6C offers unmatched value. Purchase compatible measurement software (AudioTool for Android, Audiotools for iOS) to utilize calibration files effectively. The device-dependent noise performance necessitates testing with your specific hardware configuration. Consider the UMIK-1 or UMIK-2 for applications demanding superior signal-to-noise performance or standalone operation. The IMM-6C excels for mobile measurement scenarios, room correction setup, and educational applications where calibrated accuracy matters more than ultimate noise performance.
