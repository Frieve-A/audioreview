## Overview

The Solid State Logic SSL 2+ MKII is a 2-in/4-out, 32-bit/192 kHz USB-C audio interface aimed at home and project studios. MKII brings measurable updates over MKI—most notably **120 dB A-wtd dynamic range on the balanced line outputs** and lower THD+N—while the 2+ variant retains SSL’s optional **Legacy 4K** enhancement and, critically, provides **two headphone outputs with independent mixes**. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer data for MKII specify **balanced outputs: 120 dB A-wtd DR, THD+N −108 dB (<0.0004%)**; **mic preamps: 116.5 dB DR, EIN −130.5 dBu**; and tight frequency response (≤±0.03–0.05 dB). [1] The 2+ model additionally offers **independent headphone mixes** without sacrificing those output specs. [2][3] As comprehensive third-party lab measurements for MKII are still limited, we discount for confidence and set **0.7**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

MKII moves to **32-bit/192 kHz** conversion with across-the-board spec gains (e.g., outputs **112→120 dB DR** vs. MKI) and keeps the user-switchable Legacy 4K circuit for optional coloration. [1][3] The 2+ variant’s **dual independent headphone mixes** and **MIDI I/O** align with modern small-studio workflows. [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Street price (US): 299.99 USD.** [4]

To be strictly equivalent, a comparator must simultaneously match the SSL 2+ MKII’s **functions**—**4 analog line outputs**, **MIDI I/O**, and **two independent headphone mixes (without consuming the line outputs)**—and meet its **measured neutrality** (≈**120 dB-class** line-output DR with low THD+N). [1][2][3]

- **MOTU M4**: has **MIDI I/O** and **120 dB DR** on main outs, but only **one headphone output**; creating a second independent HP mix requires using outputs **3/4**, which then leaves just **2** line outputs available—**not simultaneously equivalent** to SSL’s **4 line outs + dual HP mixes**. [6]

- Cheaper “feature-match” units (e.g., **Steinberg UR44C** with **6 TRS outs**, **2 headphones**, **MIDI**) do not hit 120 dB-class output performance in published figures/retailer specs. [8]

The **lowest-cost model we can verify** that meets or exceeds **both** the function set (≥4 line outs **and** 2 HP outs **and** MIDI) **and** offers **≥120 dB-class conversion** is **Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 (4th Gen)** (two independent HP outs, MIDI I/O, 122 dB DR), at **699.99 USD**. [9][10] Since no cheaper configuration achieves full equivalence as of 2025-08-16, the SSL 2+ MKII is **the cheapest equivalent**, so **CP = 1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

SSL has established distribution, drivers, and documentation; nothing in MKII suggests unusual risk. Model-specific long-term field data remain limited, so we keep this slightly above average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

MKII’s revisions emphasize **verifiable performance** while leaving “4K” as an optional creative effect. The 2+ model’s **4 line outputs, MIDI I/O, and two independent headphone mixes** are practical for cueing and external gear without compromising baseline transparency. [1][2][3]

## Advice

If you need **4 line outs, MIDI I/O, and two independent headphone mixes** in a compact interface—**and** you care about transparent measurements—the SSL 2+ MKII is a balanced choice with **no cheaper fully equivalent** alternative right now. If you don’t need dual HP mixes or MIDI, many 2×2 interfaces cost less; but once you add boxes to replicate SSL’s function set **and** maintain 4 line outs, the total typically exceeds the 2+ MKII.
