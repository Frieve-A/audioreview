## Overview

Apple AirPods 3 (3rd generation), released in 2021, is an open-design true wireless earbuds. Featuring custom-designed high-excursion drivers and high dynamic range amplifiers, it supports personalized spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. The Adaptive EQ function continuously adjusts acoustics according to ear shape, with IPX4 water resistance rating. Currently priced around 17,800 yen, it positions itself as an entry-level model within Apple's genuine ecosystem.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

According to RTINGS measurement data, AirPods 3 achieves satisfactory evaluation for neutral sound quality and demonstrates excellent imaging performance. Group delay remains below audibility threshold, with L/R drivers very well matched in amplitude, frequency, and phase response. However, the open design makes deep bass reproduction difficult, with mid-bass also restrained. Frequency response consistency is good, though bass delivery depends on ear fit and positioning. While Adaptive EQ provides continuous acoustic adjustment, user EQ customization capabilities are absent. Spatial audio functionality proves effective, but physical sound isolation performance remains limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Apple H1 chip integration enables low latency and seamless Apple device pairing. The combination of custom-designed high-excursion drivers and high dynamic range amplifiers is technically superior, with personalized spatial audio and dynamic head tracking representing advanced functionality. Dual beamforming microphones provide call quality very close to natural voice that's highly intelligible, performing adequately for home and office telework use. However, compared to AirPods 4, it shows inferiority across nearly all measurement metrics, particularly in bass response and microphone noise processing capabilities. While the technical foundation is solid, the gap with newer generations is significant.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Against the current market price of 17,800 yen, comparable functionality products include Soundcore Liberty 5 (14,990 yen, 32-hour battery, ANC, app support) and Nothing Ear (a) (14,800 yen, ANC, transparent design, 45dB isolation). Considering open design, the same-category AirPods 4 (21,800 yen, improved bass response, enhanced microphone performance) shows a reasonable 4,000 yen price difference reflecting technological advancement. While Apple ecosystem integration and Adaptive EQ provide differentiation factors, the absence of ANC and physical sound isolation limits overall value proposition. CP = 14,800 yen รท 17,800 yen = 0.83, indicating relatively good price competitiveness.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Apple genuine product quality control maintains industry-leading standards, with many Apple products demonstrating excellent imaging performance reflecting brand quality control and ergonomics. IPX4 water resistance handles exercise sweat and light water splashes but doesn't support full waterproofing. The 1-year warranty period meets industry standards, with AppleCare+ extended warranty also available. Battery life delivers practical 6-hour advertised performance levels. Firmware updates are reliably provided through Apple ecosystem, with repair services available worldwide. However, battery replacement costs are relatively high, presenting cost burden challenges for long-term use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Design philosophy prioritizing open-design comfort and external sound integration is clear, providing rational choice for users who dislike canal-type earphones. However, against the 17,800 yen price point, sound isolation performance significantly lags behind same-price ANC earphones. While Adaptive EQ functionality is innovative, the absence of user customization prevents personal preference adjustments. Apple ecosystem integration provides convenience but contributes limitedly to specialized device acoustic performance improvement. The existence of AirPods 4 proves superior technical implementation is possible with the same design philosophy, raising questions about current-generation model rationality.

## Advice

Apple AirPods 3 suits users primarily within Apple ecosystem who dislike canal-type earphones and prioritize basic music listening and call functionality. Open-design comfort and external sound integration capabilities prove practical for daily use. Spatial audio functionality enhances movie viewing and music experience, with Adaptive EQ providing ear-optimized acoustics. However, against the 17,800 yen price point, higher-performance AirPods 4 (21,800 yen) shows a 4,000 yen difference, recommending the upper model if budget permits. For those prioritizing ANC and strong sound isolation, strongly consider same-price canal-type ANC earphones like Nothing Ear (a) (14,800 yen) or Soundcore Liberty 5 (14,990 yen).
