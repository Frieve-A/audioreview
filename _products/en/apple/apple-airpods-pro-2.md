## Overview

Apple AirPods Pro 2, released in 2022, is Apple's flagship wireless earbuds featuring the H2 chip and delivering 2x better Active Noise Cancellation compared to the previous generation. It achieves low-distortion playback through custom drivers and amplifiers, with Adaptive EQ providing real-time audio tuning. Priced at 250 USD, it targets the premium wireless earbuds market with advanced features and seamless Apple ecosystem integration.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The H2 chip enables low-distortion drivers and amplifiers, achieving lower THD than the previous generation. Adaptive EQ uses inward-facing microphones to measure actual listening audio and adjust low-to-mid frequencies in real-time, representing a scientifically sound approach. Frequency response follows ideal curves closely below 8kHz within the 20Hz-20kHz range, with ANC delivering 27dB average noise reduction. However, Apple officially withholds detailed THD values and SNR specifications, making it difficult to verify transparent-level achievement according to measurement standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The comprehensive technical integration centered on the H2 chip, combining custom drivers, dedicated amplifiers, Adaptive EQ, and spatial audio technology, represents industry-leading expertise. The real-time audio adjustment functionality particularly delivers measurable performance improvements. However, compared to cutting-edge DAC technology, the innovation in basic audio performance remains limited and does not reach absolute industry-leading standards. The overall technical implementation demonstrates solid engineering but lacks breakthrough innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Competing products in the same price range include Sony WF-1000XM4 (250 USD) offering equivalent ANC performance, LDAC support, 360 Reality Audio, and 8+16 hour battery life. More affordable options include Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC (100 USD) achieving equivalent ANC performance (95% noise reduction), LDAC support, and 10+40 hour battery life. Using Liberty 4 NC as the baseline equivalent product: CP = 100 USD รท 250 USD = 0.40. However, considering Apple ecosystem integration value, the final evaluation is adjusted to 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Apple's global support infrastructure and 1-year warranty, plus AppleCare+ extended warranty options, provide robust coverage. Firmware updates continue regularly, with version 7E93 in March 2025 adding hearing protection features. However, replacement costs for the proprietary charging case are high, and battery replacement support is limited. Failure rate data remains undisclosed, preventing objective reliability assessment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Adaptive EQ for individual differences, H2 chip integrated processing, and scientific ANC implementation demonstrate rational design approaches. However, the necessity as a dedicated audio device is questionable. Equivalent performance can be achieved with smartphone + external DAC solutions (approximately 100 USD), and the performance difference versus general-purpose devices cannot justify the price differential. The delayed transition from proprietary charging standards to USB-C also indicates design efficiency issues.

## Advice

Apple AirPods Pro 2 certainly delivers high-quality wireless earbuds performance and excellent user experience within the Apple ecosystem. However, those prioritizing pure audio quality and cost performance should recognize that EarFun Air Pro 4 and CMF Buds 2 Plus achieve equivalent or superior performance at less than 1/3 the price. This product is recommended only for users who value Apple product integration and brand value and can tolerate the price premium. For audio quality priority, wired earbuds + dedicated DAC amplifier combinations in the same price range offer overwhelming superiority.
