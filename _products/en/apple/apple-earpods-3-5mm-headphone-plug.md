## Overview

The Apple EarPods with 3.5mm Headphone Plug are wired earphones that Apple has provided for many years. Unlike traditional circular earphones, they are designed based on the geometry of the human ear, achieving comfortable fit for many users. The built-in speakers are engineered to maximize acoustic output and minimize sound leakage. Remote control functionality enables volume adjustment, music and video playback control, and call answering/ending, with compatibility across all devices featuring a 3.5mm headphone jack.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

According to measurement data from RTINGS and Reference Audio Analyzer, the EarPods exhibit problems across multiple critical performance indicators. The open-back design limits low-frequency extension (LFE) performance to 70Hz, with sub-bass deficiency of 12dB. This significantly deviates from the measurement criteria table's ideal value of 20Hz-20kHz (±0.5dB). Furthermore, there are serious issues with acoustic characteristic stability based on fit position, with variations reaching up to 6dB in bass regions and 9dB in treble regions. Sensitivity measures 117.7dB SPL/V with impedance at 42.4Ω. While the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is acceptable at around 0.18%, achieving truly transparent sound quality remains out of reach.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The EarPods employ a conventional design using standard dynamic drivers, with no particularly innovative technological elements evident. The open-back structure represents a design choice prioritizing comfort, but creates significant constraints from an acoustic performance perspective. No Apple-proprietary patent technologies or advanced acoustic engineering approaches are identifiable, keeping the technology level at industry average standards. While design claims of maximizing acoustic output and minimizing sound leakage exist, their effectiveness appears limited based on measurement results.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The Apple EarPods are currently priced at 3,800 yen in Japan (or 19 USD in the US). A comparable product from Daiso, offering similar functionality and Hi-Res certification, is available for 550 yen. Based on the Japanese market prices, the cost-performance calculation is: CP = 550 yen ÷ 3,800 yen = 0.145, resulting in a score of 0.1. With alternatives providing the basic functions users seek at a fraction of the price (approximately one-seventh) alongside higher specifications, cost-performance receives an extremely low evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As an Apple product, the EarPods provide excellent support systems and reliability. Industry-leading customer support can be expected through Apple's global authorized service provider network for repair services, clear warranty systems, and easy availability of replacement parts. Regarding product durability, Apple brand quality control standards apply, providing sufficient reliability considering the price range.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The EarPods' design philosophy prioritizing comfort above all else forces significant compromises in acoustic performance. While the open-back design contributes to improved fit comfort, it becomes a fundamental constraint on bass reproduction capability, representing an irrational approach from a high-fidelity acoustic reproduction perspective. Modern acoustic technologies such as noise cancellation or high-resolution audio source support are absent. Compared to general-purpose devices (smartphone + high-performance external DAC/amplifier), the existence value as dedicated earphones becomes ambiguous, resulting in below-average rationality evaluation.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing Apple EarPods, we recommend first clarifying usage purposes and budget. If you prioritize design consistency with Apple products and a comfortable fit over sound quality, they may be a viable option. However, if acoustic performance and cost-performance are priorities, alternatives should be considered. Particularly, the Daiso Hi-Res 7301 provides equivalent functionality at a fraction of the price while achieving higher specifications through Hi-Res Audio certification. For those seeking more serious acoustic experiences, closed-type earphones or custom IEMs are recommended. Current EarPods struggle to demonstrate clear advantages beyond design consistency with other Apple products.
