## Overview

The Apple EarPods USB-C is Apple's wired earphone released in 2024. It features a USB-C connector instead of the previous Lightning connection, making it compatible with the latest iPhones and many Android devices. The product adopts an open-air design with a distinctive shape that does not include ear tips. With basic specifications including 109dB sensitivity, 23ฮฉ impedance, and a frequency range of 5Hz-21kHz, it incorporates remote control functions and a built-in microphone. While designed with emphasis on compatibility within the Apple ecosystem, it faces numerous constraints in terms of acoustic performance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

According to RTINGS measurements, there is a 12dB deficiency in the bass region, with bass extension limited to 70Hz. TechGearLab's frequency response measurements show significant deviations from the reference curve except in the midrange, with sharp attenuation confirmed in both bass and treble regions. The open-air design provides no seal, resulting in noticeable sound leakage and no external noise isolation. Frequency response consistency is also problematic, with significant variations in bass and treble reproduction depending on fit position. Left-right channel mismatches have been confirmed through measurements, affecting sound image localization accuracy. These measurement results clearly indicate problem-level performance in terms of fidelity to master audio sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The design uses basic dynamic drivers in a conventional configuration with no proprietary technologies or advanced elements visible. The open-air design is a classic approach that has existed since the 1950s and represents an extremely basic configuration from the perspective of modern technical standards. No modern technologies such as DSP-based sound correction or active noise cancellation are incorporated. The adoption of USB-C connector is merely a change responding to the demands of the times and not a technological advancement in acoustics. Driver design, housing design, and signal processing are all several generations behind compared to current technical standards. It ranks among the lowest in the industry's technology level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

In the Japanese market, the EarPods are priced at 19 USD, while a comparable alternative, the VE Monk Plus (with mic), is available for about 8 USD. The cost-performance calculation is based on these prices: 8 USD รท 19 USD = 0.43..., which rounds to a rating of 0.4. The VE Monk Plus offers a similar open-air design and functionality, with acoustic performance that is comparable or superior, making it a valid comparison.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

As an Apple product, it comes with a one-year warranty, which is industry standard level for the consumable earphone category. Reports regarding cable connection durability are limited, and long-term reliability remains unclear. While Apple's repair infrastructure is well-established, the practicality of repair services for products in this price range is questionable. There are no firmware update functions, making it a hardware-fixed specification product. While the open-air design presents relatively low physical damage risk, the overall reliability and support structure remains at a level commensurate with the price.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The open-air design is a classic approach that physically limits bass reproduction capability and appears irrational from the perspective of modern acoustic engineering. By eliminating sealing through ear tips, it can be said to intentionally limit acoustic performance. Despite the establishment of technologies that can achieve sealed designs or superior acoustic characteristics even in the same price range in modern times, it adheres to outdated design philosophy. While USB-C connector adoption is rational, there are no improvements in acoustics. While the emphasis on compatibility within the Apple ecosystem is understandable, the complete absence of scientific approaches to sound quality improvement makes the design philosophy extremely irrational.

## Advice

The Apple EarPods USB-C can only be considered an option when compatibility within the Apple ecosystem is the highest priority. It cannot be recommended for users who prioritize sound quality. In the same price range, alternatives such as KZ EDX or VE Monk Plus significantly excel in acoustic performance. Particularly when seeking bass reproduction capability or sound image localization accuracy, the physical constraints of this product are fatal. Even for iPhone users, it would be more rational to use a USB-C to Lightning adapter and choose higher-performance earphones. If Apple genuine products must be used, we strongly recommend considering the AirPods series. For sound quality priority, third-party products adopting sealed designs are clearly superior choices.
