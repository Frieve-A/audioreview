## Overview

Apple AirPods 4 is Apple's fourth-generation wireless earbuds released in September 2024. Following the design philosophy of previous AirPods series, it adopts an open design rather than an in-ear type. Equipped with the H2 chip, it provides features such as personalized spatial audio and adaptive EQ. The USB-C charging case achieves up to 30 hours of playback time. While offering high compatibility with Apple products, pricing challenges have been noted.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

According to RTINGS.com measurements, AirPods 4 exhibits excellent weighted harmonic distortion performance with THD values below 0.1% across most frequency ranges, though a peak occurs between the low- and mid-treble regions reaching approximately 0.3-0.5%. The frequency response shows ±2-3dB deviation across 20Hz-20kHz for an open design, with particularly excellent bass target compliance achieving near-ideal low-frequency performance. The H2 chip's adaptive EQ and personalized spatial audio provide practical improvements in iOS environments. However, due to physical constraints of the open design, scientific validity is limited compared to closed-type earbuds achieving ±1dB accuracy. Measurement performance is at standard levels within the same category.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Features Apple's proprietary technologies including adaptive EQ via H2 chip, personalized spatial audio, and high-fidelity audio. Employs custom high-excursion drivers to achieve improved low-frequency characteristics despite the open design. Practical technology implementation includes frequency response optimization for AAC connections. However, fundamental audio technology remains at industry standard levels, lacking breakthrough acoustic technologies or outstanding measurement performance characteristics. While design refinement is high, evaluation is moderate in terms of technological breakthrough power.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The market price of AirPods 4 is 169 USD. As a comparable open-design wireless earbud with equivalent functionality and performance, Nothing Ear (Open) (199 USD) serves as the comparison target. Nothing Ear (Open) offers open design, Bluetooth 5.3, multipoint connection, EQ customization features, and equivalent playback time. Since AirPods 4 is the most affordable among equivalent open-design products, the cost-performance score is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

In addition to Apple's standard one-year warranty, extended warranty options are available through AppleCare+. A comprehensive repair and support system is established domestically in Japan through Apple's global authorized service provider network. Provides generous support policies including 90-day service warranty and free replacement for batteries below 80% capacity. Past track record of free repair programs for specific acoustic issues in AirPods series demonstrates commendable attitude toward quality problem resolution. The stable support system as a global company is at industry-leading levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design emphasizing integration with Apple's product ecosystem provides practical value for iPhone users. Features contributing to convenience improvements such as AAC optimization, automatic device switching, and Find My app compatibility are rationally implemented. The adoption of open design provides value for specific use cases balancing ambient sound awareness with music playback. However, there are aspects that prioritize brand and ecosystem integration over pure acoustic performance pursuit, limiting rationality as audio equipment. The design philosophy can be evaluated as emphasizing comprehensive user experience over necessity as dedicated audio equipment.

## Advice

AirPods 4 offers good cost-performance as an open-design wireless earbud and is recommended for Apple product ecosystem users. Since equivalent open-design competing products are substantially more expensive, it becomes a rational choice in this price range. However, recommendation decreases for Android device users due to functional limitations. For those prioritizing high isolation of closed-type earbuds or ANC, considering closed-type products like Nothing Ear is recommended. It is suitable for applications requiring ambient sound awareness while emphasizing the balance between convenience and price.
