## Overview

The Apple AirPods Max is Apple's flagship wireless over-ear headphones released in 2020. Featuring custom-designed 40mm drivers and H1 chips, they incorporate active noise cancellation, Adaptive EQ, and Spatial Audio features. The USB-C version launched in September 2024 and currently retails for 549 USD [1]. They feature an aluminum housing and premium build quality at 386.2g weight.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Distortion (THD)**: AirPods Max achieves THD below 1% across the entire audible range [1]. Third-party measurements using Brüel & Kjær 5128 on Head-Fi.org show peak THD of only 0.731% at 342Hz at maximum volume, with most frequencies staying below 0.1% [2]. SoundStage! measurements recorded approximately 4% distortion at the extremely high level of 100dBA [3]. Against headphone THD standards (0.05% excellent, 0.5% problematic), performance at normal listening levels is good.

**Frequency Response**: Covers the 20Hz-20kHz range but shows deviations from the Harman target curve. Excessive bass boost, approximately 5dB under-emphasis in the 2-6kHz band (upper midrange recession), and slight elevation around 1kHz are confirmed [4][6]. Treble shows roll-off tendency above 10kHz. Against headphone frequency response standards (±3dB standard, ±5dB+ problematic), this reaches the problematic level boundary.

**ANC Performance**: RTings measurements show -15.53dB to -19.92dB attenuation in the bass range (varying by firmware version) [7]. Apple claims up to 26dB noise reduction. Particularly excellent performance in the 100Hz-1kHz band (airplane noise range), though slightly inferior compared to competitor Sony WH-1000XM5 (approximately 30dB attenuation) [4]. Against ANC standards (30dB+ excellent, 10dB or below problematic), performance is intermediate.

Overall, while THD is good, frequency response deviation reaches the problematic level boundary, and ANC does not reach the excellent level, resulting in a 0.4 evaluation at the problematic level boundary.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

H1 chip active noise cancellation processing, Adaptive EQ function, and Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking qualify as proprietary patent technology (+0.1) [1]. The custom-designed 40mm drivers with dual-neodymium magnet motor structure represent in-house design (+0.1). The hybrid ANC configuration with 8 external and 2 internal microphones and computational audio approach are technologies that competitors follow (+0.1). Siri integration, Spatial Audio, and seamless Bluetooth switching with Apple devices demonstrate advanced smartphone/cloud/AI integration (+0.1). While fundamental acoustic design represents existing technology combinations without innovative measured performance breakthroughs, the technology integration level is high.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. AirPods Max currently retails at 549 USD [1]. As a competitor with equivalent or better functionality, Sony WH-1000XM5 (currently approximately 248 USD, 30-hour battery, equivalent or better ANC performance) exists [5]. Both products offer excellent ANC, with XM5 showing approximately 10dB better attenuation above 1kHz, while AirPods Max has advantages in the 100Hz-1kHz band [4]. Functionally, XM5 provides Adaptive Sound Control, 30-hour battery (vs AirPods Max's 20 hours), and lighter design (250g vs 386g). CP = 248 USD ÷ 549 USD = 0.45, resulting in 0.5 evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Apple's 1-year warranty is shorter than the industry average of 2 years (-0.1), though global support infrastructure exists (+0.1). Regular firmware updates are maintained (latest 6F25) (+0.1) [4]. However, condensation issue reports exist in the past (-0.1), and while repair infrastructure is comprehensive, expensive repair costs remain problematic (-0.1). Apple brand has a reliability track record (+0.1). The 386.2g weight and metal housing contribute to durability, but long-term reliability of moving parts is unknown.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

H1 chip Adaptive EQ and computational audio represent measurement-focused scientific approaches (+0.1). However, costs are largely invested in aluminum housing and material quality rather than directly contributing to acoustic performance (-0.1). Since the 2020 release, the USB-C version (2024) added no new features, showing no performance progression (-0.1). Apple ecosystem integration is advanced (+0.1), but the 386.2g weight design compromises usability for extended sessions, raising cost optimization concerns (-0.1). Dedicated Smart Case design questions practicality, showing overall appearance-focused aspects strongly. SBC and AAC codec-only support (no aptX) represents functional limitations [4]. In terms of innovative attitude, updates since release have been limited (-0.1).

## Advice

AirPods Max is recommended only for users wanting complete Apple ecosystem integration and accepting the 549 USD price point. Measurement data shows good distortion and ANC performance, but Sony WH-1000XM5 offers equivalent or superior functionality for approximately 300 USD less [5]. For pure sound quality priority, consider wired headphones and DAC amplifier combinations at similar prices. Especially for extended listening, the 386.2g weight and 20-hour battery life compare unfavorably to XM5 (250g, 30 hours). Unless prioritizing Apple product connectivity and premium build quality, alternative choices offer better cost-performance.
