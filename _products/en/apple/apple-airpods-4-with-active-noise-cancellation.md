## Overview

The Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, released in September 2024, is Apple's open-ear noise-canceling earphone featuring the H2 chip. This innovative product has garnered attention for implementing active noise cancellation without adopting traditional sealed designs. With an official Apple price of 179 USD (equivalent to approximately 26,850 yen), the product is available at market prices around 179 USD, and it features high compatibility with the Apple ecosystem. The open-ear design achieves both wearing comfort and ambient sound awareness while suppressing low-frequency noise, representing a different approach from conventional ANC earphones.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ANC performance in the open-ear design shows measurable effectiveness in low-frequency bands, with SoundGuys.com measurements achieving approximately 20dB of isolation performance in mid-high frequencies. RTings.com measurements show frequency response within ±3dB across most of the audible range with particularly good bass target compliance. Professional measurements indicate THD levels remain below 0.1% across most frequencies, with some peaks in the treble region. The H2 chip's adaptive noise cancellation provides approximately 10-15dB of low-frequency noise reduction, significantly less than sealed designs which typically achieve 25-40dB. While effective for office environments and mild noise reduction, the fundamental physical constraints of open-ear design limit overall isolation performance compared to sealed alternatives.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The adoption of the H2 chip certainly demonstrates technological advancement, and the combination of custom-designed low-distortion driver units and high dynamic range amplifiers is engineering excellence. The implementation of ANC in an open-ear structure has technical uniqueness as an industry-first attempt, but it has not overcome fundamental physical law constraints. The upgraded microphone array and signal processing algorithms are at contemporary standards, but innovation is moderate when viewed from the latest digital technology standards. Apple's SoC integration technology and power efficiency are at industry-leading levels, but in terms of pure acoustic performance, they remain an extension of conventional technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 179 USD, the AirPods 4 ANC is effectively the only choice in the mainstream market that combines an "open-ear" design with "Active Noise Cancellation" (ANC). According to the review policy, if a cheaper alternative with equivalent features and performance does not exist, the cost-performance is rated 1.0. Open-ear earbuds without ANC are not comparable due to inferior functionality, and sealed (in-ear) earbuds with ANC cannot provide the fundamental value of this product—being open-ear—making a direct comparison inappropriate. Therefore, as this product establishes its own unique category, its cost-performance score is 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Apple's global support system is at industry-leading standards, with comprehensive customer service and repair systems established in Japan. Automatic firmware updates through iOS integration, AppleCare+ extended warranty options, and support at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers nationwide are available. Product failure rates are below industry average, and maintenance services such as battery replacement are available. The H2 chip's software features are continuously updated, with long-term functional improvements expected. However, long-term evaluation of physical durability due to the open-ear design is still limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The open-ear ANC design represents a highly rational approach for users prioritizing comfort, ambient awareness, and extended wearing periods while maintaining some noise reduction capability. This design philosophy addresses genuine user needs that sealed designs cannot fulfill, creating a legitimate product category rather than a compromise solution. The achievement of functional ANC in an open-ear format demonstrates significant engineering rationality, as Apple successfully solved technical challenges that other manufacturers have failed to address. While the design trades maximum noise cancellation for other benefits, this represents a rational design decision for the target user base. The integration with Apple's ecosystem and the unique value proposition of maintaining environmental awareness while reducing unwanted noise shows strong design philosophy rationality for its intended use cases.

## Advice

AirPods 4 ANC can be strongly recommended for users who prioritize the Apple ecosystem and seek the comfort of open-ear design with meaningful noise reduction capability. As the only mainstream open-ear ANC option available, it successfully fulfills a unique market need that sealed alternatives cannot address. The product excels in scenarios requiring ambient awareness while reducing background noise, making it ideal for office environments, casual listening, and extended wearing periods.

For users requiring maximum noise isolation, sealed ANC earbuds offer superior performance but eliminate the fundamental benefits of open-ear design including ambient awareness, comfort during extended use, and natural sound perception. However, these represent fundamentally different product categories serving different user needs rather than direct alternatives.

When considering purchase, evaluate whether the unique combination of open-ear comfort, ambient awareness, and active noise reduction aligns with your usage patterns. The strong Apple ecosystem integration, including Shared Audio functionality, spatial audio, and seamless Siri integration, adds significant value for Apple device users. Given the absence of direct competitors in the open-ear ANC category, this product offers unique functionality that cannot be replicated by traditional sealed designs, making it a rational choice for users seeking this specific combination of features.
