price: 79.99
summary: "Wired gaming IEM with 6 mm f-Core DU driver, brass front-housing, and in-line mic/remote. Smart, comfort-first design but faces heavy value pressure from budget IEMs that match user-facing performance for far less with a detachable cable + mic bundle."

## Overview

final’s VR3000 for Gaming is a 2021 wired IEM tuned for games/VR. It uses a 6 mm f-Core DU dynamic driver, a brass **front-housing** for magnetic immunity/mass loading, and a 30 μm CCAW voice coil; it’s rated 18 Ω / 101 dB per mW. The cable is **non-detachable** and includes a 3-button remote with in-line mic; the over-ear fit and lock-type ear hooks reduce microphonics [1][3]. Typical US price is 79.99 USD [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent lab data for VR3000 (FR/THD/IMD/SNR/isolation) is limited. Manufacturer specs are conventional (18 Ω, 101 dB/mW; 20 Hz–20 kHz) [1]. Public FR databases list VR3000 and show peers that adhere closely to modern targets; notably Moondrop **Chu II** pairs near-target FR with low-distortion spec **THD ≤ 0.5% @ 1 kHz, 94 dB** (manufacturer) [4][7]. With scarce third-party quant for VR3000, we anchor at the baseline 0.5 while noting claims are plausible but under-measured.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The in-house f-Core DU driver, brass front-housing for magnetic control and mass loading, and a 30 μm CCAW coil are rational modern choices. Ergonomics (over-ear with lock hooks) target cable noise and long sessions [1]. Overall, above-average implementation versus generic OEMs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Market price (review target):** 79.99 USD [2].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better (mic parity via bundle):** Moondrop **Chu II** **22.99 USD** [5] **+ Tripowin Grace Microphone Cable (0.78 mm 2-pin, 3.5 mm) 19.00 USD** [6].  
**Equivalence note:** Equipped with in-line mic capability (via cable), and **FR adherence** and **THD** are equivalent-or-better for competitive use based on public datasets and manufacturer specs [4][7].

**CP calculation:** 41.99 USD ÷ 79.99 USD = **0.5249** → first-decimal rounding → **0.5**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

final is established with broad retail coverage. Single-dynamic topology is simple, but the **fixed cable** reduces serviceability compared with detachable-cable peers. In-line mic/remote is a practical plus for gaming [1][3]. Net: average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Focus on spatial coherence, comfort, and microphonic control is evidence-based for gaming. Material and motor decisions are technically sensible, avoiding “gaming” coloration that lacks measured benefit [1].

## Advice

Pick VR3000 if you want a ready-to-use **wired IEM with built-in mic**, low cable noise, and long-session comfort. If value dominates, a **Chu II + mic cable** bundle delivers equivalent user-facing functionality and measured performance at far lower cost [4][5][6][7].
