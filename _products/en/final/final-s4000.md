## Overview

The Final Audio S4000 is a dual balanced-armature in-ear monitor listed at 329 USD in the US market, featuring a stainless-steel housing, a newly developed “tone chamber system,” and a repair-friendly structure. It ships with a soft 8-core silver-coated OFC cable using standard 0.78 mm 2-pin connectors, Fusion-G eartips, and supports either cable-down or over-ear wear. Key catalog specs include 48 Ω impedance and 112 dB sensitivity. [1][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As of August 18, 2025, no credible third-party B&K 5128/IEC 60318-4 measurements of the S4000’s frequency response, distortion, or isolation are publicly available. Therefore, we default to a neutral 0.5 pending independent data. Manufacturer specifications confirm dual full-range BA drivers arranged in a horizontal opposition layout, 48 Ω impedance, and 112 dB sensitivity, but do not disclose THD or isolation figures relevant to audibility thresholds. This score will warrant revision when reliable lab data emerges. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The S4000 exhibits several thoughtful engineering choices: a “tone chamber system” to control the front-volume acoustics of the BA drivers, dual full-range BAs mounted in a horizontal opposition configuration aimed at reducing self-resonance, precision stainless-steel housings, and a repair-forward, adhesive-minimized assembly. Detachable 2-pin cabling and a two-year warranty are also positives. These are competent, mildly original implementations rather than industry-leading breakthroughs. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Basis price (denominator):** 329 USD (current representative US price). [3]

**Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **Moondrop Chu II** (wired IEM with detachable 2-pin cable). Third-party graphs (B&K 5128) show a response closely tracking modern targets, and the manufacturer publishes a THD figure ≤0.5% at 1 kHz/94 dB. On user-visible functions (wired operation, passive isolation form factor, detachable cable) and audibility-relevant axes (target-conforming FR with low distortion at normal levels), Chu II is judged equivalent-or-better for fidelity. **Market price:** 19 USD. **Calculation:** 19 USD ÷ 329 USD = **0.06** → rounded to one decimal place = **0.1**. (Provisional until S4000 third-party measurements appear.) [4][5][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Final provides a two-year warranty for the S4000. The stainless-steel shell, standard 2-pin interface, and a design intended for disassembly/repair indicate sensible serviceability and durability considerations. No public failure-rate data was found; support quality appears typical for this segment. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The development direction—mechanically controlling driver interaction (horizontal opposition), managing front volume via a tone chamber, and enabling repairability—is rational from an engineering perspective. However, without published independent measurements demonstrating transparent-level outcomes (e.g., target-conforming FR within tight tolerances, very low distortion), we cannot judge the approach as strongly validated. Hence a neutral score. [1]

## Advice

If you specifically value a stainless-steel micro-shell, dual BA architecture, and a repair-friendly build, the S4000 offers a distinctive package. For measurable fidelity at minimal cost, proven budget IEMs like the Moondrop Chu II already deliver target-aligned response for a fraction of the price, which translates into dramatically stronger objective value until credible S4000 lab data becomes available. [4][5]
