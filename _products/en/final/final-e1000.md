## Overview
The final E1000 is a **6.4 mm single dynamic** IEM rated **16 Ω / 102 dB/mW** with a lightweight ABS shell and **swing-fit** ergonomics. It targets a neutral presentation and runs easily from phone or laptop outputs［1］. Japan release: **Nov 30, 2018**［5］.

## Scientific Validity
$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$
Independent **frequency-response** data exist on an **IEC60318-4** coupler (In-Ear Fidelity)［2,3］. Public lab-grade data beyond FR (e.g., THD, isolation) are limited, so the evidence base is **moderate** rather than comprehensive.

## Technology Level
$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$
A small **1DD + ABS** build with a fixed OFC cable prioritizes comfort and practicality. In 2025, this is **competent but unremarkable**, lacking novel diaphragm materials or advanced acoustic structures［1］.

## Cost-Performance
$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$
**US/global street**: E1000 about **29.99 USD** (retail example). A widely available alternative with equal-or-better measured tonality, **7Hz Salnotes Zero**, is **22.99 USD**; **ratio ≈ 1.30**—indicating the E1000 is price-pressured globally［4,9–11］.  

## Reliability & Support
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$
Final provides a **1-year warranty** via authorized dealers and clear after-sales information. No aggregate failure-rate statistics are published; coverage is **industry-standard**［1,4］.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$
A **neutral, fuss-free** tuning and easy fit reflect sound engineering priorities［1］. The approach remains sensible, though differentiation is thinner as newer sub-30 USD IEMs better track targets.

## Advice
- Pick **E1000** for **lightweight comfort** and **restrained tonality**, especially if buying in Japan.  
- Prefer **7Hz Salnotes Zero (22.99 USD)** for **closer-to-target FR** at lower global pricing［9–11］.  
- Consider **Moondrop CHU II (≈¥4,950 JP)** if you want Moondrop’s house tuning and 2-pin recabling［8,12］.  
- Want a more **V-shaped** fun sound? **CCA CRA** remains popular, but its tonality deviates more from neutral［13］.
