## Overview

The final A5000 is an in-ear monitor (IEM) launched in December 2022, featuring the company's proprietary f-Core DU driver. Priced at 219 USD, it exhibits a V-shaped acoustic characteristic with emphasized bass and treble frequencies. While certain technical considerations are evident, such as the brass housing and CCAW voice coil, it is difficult to identify a clear advantage when compared to competing products.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The A5000 exhibits a distinct V-shaped frequency response, significantly deviating from an ideal flat response. According to reliable third-party measurement data, not only are the bass and treble regions boosted, but there is also a strong, audibly prominent peak around 5kHz. This intentional tuning limits its scientific validity from the perspective of faithful sound reproduction. Although the manufacturer claims a "distortion-free listening experience," the strong coloration from this characteristic hinders fidelity to the original source.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The f-Core DU driver is the company's proprietary development, incorporating technical considerations such as reduced magnetic influence through the brass front housing and the adoption of a 30ฮผ ultra-fine CCAW voice coil. The vibration suppression design utilizing brass's high specific gravity and the diaphragm pressure equalization process demonstrate commendable efforts toward distortion reduction. The adoption of an 8-core silver-coated OFC cable is also technically sound. However, these technologies do not reach industry-leading standards, and similar technical approaches are employed in other manufacturers' products.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

For its price of 219 USD, competing products with more faithful acoustic performance are available at a significantly lower cost. A prime example is the Moondrop Chu II (23 USD), which achieves natural acoustic characteristics while featuring a metal housing and a detachable cable. Based on a price comparison with this competitor (23 USD รท 219 USD = 0.106), the A5000's cost-performance is exceedingly low. Numerous other options exist in the same price range, and no rational reason can be found to actively choose the A5000.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As an established brand in Japan, final provides a 1-year manufacturer warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee. According to user reports, defect response within the warranty period is prompt, with the replacement process completed in approximately one week, indicating a good support system. Out-of-warranty repairs are also handled at approximately 20-30% of the retail price, providing a high level of confidence for long-term use. However, these support standards are not industry-leading but are equivalent to standard services offered by other established brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The A5000's design philosophy contains contradictions from a scientific rationality perspective. While technical considerations aimed at distortion reduction, such as the brass housing and CCAW voice coil, are rational, the final acoustic characteristic is tuned to a V-shaped profile, intentionally deviating from faithful sound reproduction. This tuning may align with some users' preferences, but it contradicts the fundamental purpose of Hi-Fi audio: "transparent sound reproduction." Despite possessing technical capabilities, the failure to utilize them for achieving acoustic transparency limits the rationality of the design philosophy to a moderate level.

## Advice

For those considering the final A5000, a comparative evaluation with competing products is strongly recommended. Products such as the Moondrop Chu II (23 USD) and Truthear Hexa (77 USD) offer more neutral and faithful acoustic characteristics at a fraction of the A5000's price. Even for those actively seeking V-shaped acoustic characteristics, numerous less expensive alternatives exist, necessitating careful consideration of the added value justifying the 219 USD investment. Except for those with a special attachment to the final brand, this product is difficult to recommend from an objective performance-to-price ratio perspective.
