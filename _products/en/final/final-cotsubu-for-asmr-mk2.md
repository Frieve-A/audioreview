## Overview

The final COTSUBU for ASMR MK2 is a specialized product developed as the successor to the world's first ASMR-dedicated wireless earphones. Jointly developed by final and ag brands, it adopts an "ultra-close sound field design" specifically for ASMR experiences, aiming to provide an immersive sensation as if you were inside a dummy head microphone. The earphones feature a lightweight 3.5g design and IPX4 water resistance, along with a special ASMR mode that employs a unique operation system to prevent accidental inputs.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The "ultra-close sound field design" of this product provides limited measurable acoustic improvements. While the frequency response covers the standard 20Hz-20kHz range, the ASMR-specific tuning results in characteristics biased toward certain midrange frequencies, limiting fidelity in Hi-Fi reproduction. Bluetooth 5.2 with SBC/AAC/aptX codec support represents contemporary specifications, but detailed measurement data including THD and S/N ratio are not publicly available, making objective acoustic performance verification difficult. The adoption of MEMS microphones is technically sound, but clear advantages at audible threshold levels cannot be confirmed.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While the ASMR-specific tuning design concept offers uniqueness, the basic wireless earphone technology remains at a general level. Specific technical papers or patents regarding the "ultra-close sound field design" cannot be verified, suggesting potential reliance on subjective acoustic adjustments. The 30mAh battery providing 5 hours of playback and IPX4 water resistance meet industry standard levels. With low transparency in measurement data and technical differentiation limited primarily to acoustic tuning, the technological innovation is assessed as moderate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

At a price of 60 USD, competing products with equivalent basic functionality exist. Compared to the EarFun Air (approximately 44 USD, IPX7 waterproof, wireless charging, 28-hour playback) and SoundPEATS T3 (approximately 26 USD, IPX5 waterproof, aptX support, 25-hour playback), equivalent performance in basic wireless earphone functionality is achieved at much lower prices. CP = 26 USD รท 60 USD = 0.43, and excluding the ASMR-specific tuning specialty, the functionality and performance as general wireless earphones is significantly overpriced.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The final/ag brand has certain recognition domestically in Japan, but international support systems are limited. The IPX4 water resistance is sufficient for daily use but not industry-leading. Warranty periods and repair systems are presumed to be at standard levels, but detailed failure rate data or MTBF values are not disclosed. There is no clear information about firmware update support, leaving questions about long-term product support reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Specialization for ASMR-specific use has certain rationality, but there are doubts about the limited measurable acoustic improvement effects. Similar effects could potentially be achieved through equalizer adjustments on general wireless earphones, making the necessity as dedicated hardware unclear. The special operation system of ASMR mode considers usage scenarios but also raises concerns about reduced usability due to functional complexity. The possibility of achieving higher acoustic performance through combination with smartphone high-quality DACs exists, limiting the advantages as dedicated equipment.

## Advice

This product specializes in the extremely niche use case of ASMR-specific applications. For general music playback or podcast listening purposes, we recommend products with more comprehensive features and superior measurement performance in the same price range, such as the EarFun Air or SoundPEATS T3. It becomes a viable option only when prioritizing ASMR experience while valuing lightweight design and dedicated mode functions, but we strongly recommend thoroughly considering the possibility of achieving equivalent or superior experiences through combinations of smartphone high-quality DACs with general wireless earphones. Before purchase, we advise actually testing the effects of ASMR-specific tuning and carefully evaluating whether the value justifies the price difference.
