## Overview
A10000 combines a **solid diamond** foil diaphragm (grown on silicon and released by dissolving the substrate), a newly formulated polyurethane surround, a precisely milled stainless-steel housing with **Côtes de Genève**, and an ePTFE-insulated silver-plated OFC cable. US street pricing is **2,999 USD**, and the **Collector’s Edition** is **limited to 300 units worldwide**[1][2][3].

## Scientific Validity
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$
End-to-end independent datasets (full-band THD, ear-gain-normalized FR, group delay) are still scarce, so we start from 0.5. Manufacturer data are explicit: **99 dB/mW** sensitivity, **13 Ω** impedance, and a new DU targeting **≤1/100** of conventional distortion **below 100 Hz** via the diamond foil + new surround[1]. Adhesive-free diaphragm bonding and the ePTFE cable are technically rational routes to lower loss; audible deltas await broader third-party confirmation[1][3].

## Technology Level
$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$
The **Solid Diamond** diaphragm, vacuum + thermal molding for molecular bonding, the new polyurethane surround, precision-milled stainless enclosure with Côtes de Genève, and the **Junkosha-collab** ePTFE MMCX cable represent state-of-the-art materials and processing for IEMs. The bobbin-equipped coil and focus on LF distortion reduction address known mechanisms directly[1][3].

## Cost-Performance
$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$
**Review-target price**: **3,000 USD** (representative US market)[3].  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator**: **Etymotic ER4SR** — wired IEM, **35–42 dB** official passive isolation and independent results showing **~39 dB** broadband isolation and **up to ~48 dB** at treble; FR adherence and low distortion are reference-grade for the class[4][5][6].  
**Calculation**: **309.99 USD ÷ 3,000 USD = 0.103…** → score **0.1**.  
*Equivalence note*: same use case (wired IEM, no ANC); on user-relevant metrics (isolation, FR adherence, low distortion) **ER4SR is at least equivalent**[4][5][6].

## Reliability & Support
$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$
The housing and DU use **screw fastening** (no adhesive) to enable long-term serviceability; stainless construction and an improved in-house MMCX with ePTFE cable point to robustness. The MMCX fit is intentionally tight and **frequent swapping is not recommended** except for failure/replacement[1]. Overall, above average for a passive IEM.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy
$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$
The design targets **measurable issues**—LF distortion, bonding variability, and dielectric effects—using testable engineering (diamond foil + new edge, adhesive-free molding, cable dielectric control)[1][3]. Non-acoustic aesthetics/limited-edition value contribute to cost, so we stop short of 1.0.

## Advice
- Choose the A10000 if you prioritize **microdetail retrieval with minimized LF distortion**. Optimize seal and isolation with the included Fusion-G/Type-E tips[1].  
- If you want **measurement-backed value**, Etymotic’s ER4SR/ER4XR remain benchmarks at a fraction of the cost[4][5][6].  
- Avoid unnecessary cable detachments; the MMCX is high-precision and **not intended for frequent swaps**[1].
