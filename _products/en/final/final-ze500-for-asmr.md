## Overview

The final ZE500 for ASMR is a purpose-built true wireless set tuned for close-proximity voices and extended bedtime listening. Key features include the pressure-relieving "ASMR Port," sleep/one-ear modes, and fine-grained volume-step control via the Final Connect app. Manufacturer specs list Bluetooth 5.4, SBC/AAC codec support, IPX4, and 4.5 hours per charge (18 hours with case). Each earbud is about 3 g. Street pricing around 74 USD has been reported at launch. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No credible third-party measurements (frequency-response ±dB, THD, IMD, S/N, passive isolation) for ZE500 were available at the time of writing. Manufacturer-published specs confirm Bluetooth 5.4, SBC/AAC, IPX4, and battery life (4.5 h buds / 18 h total), but provide no quantified FR/THD/SNR data. Advanced codecs (LDAC/aptX) are not supported. Absent independent measurement data that demonstrates transparency-level performance, the score defaults to the 0.5 baseline with current facts noted. [1][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design introduces a clearly described pressure-relief "ASMR Port," ultra-compact ~3 g housings, app-controlled "ASMR mode" (disables touch prompts), and volume-step optimization. Contemporary wireless design choices (Bluetooth 5.4, wireless charging, IPX4) and sleep-oriented usability indicate meaningful engineering aimed at the intended ASMR use case, though not cutting-edge on codec capability. [1][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Target price: 74 USD. As a comparator with **equal-or-better user functions** and **documented strong measured performance**, the Anker Soundcore Space A40 (ANC, LDAC, multipoint, ~10 h buds / 50 h total) is available at 99.99 USD on the official store and has comprehensive third-party measurements. We found **no cheaper** model with public lab-grade data showing equivalent-or-better FR/distortion/isolation as of the review date. Therefore, with the cheapest confirmed equal-or-better option priced higher, the ZE500's CP is set to 1.0. [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Final provides firmware updates via the Final Connect app and a stated **1-year** manufacturer warranty for ZE500. One year is modest versus typical two-year baselines, but routine firmware support and the brand's established presence keep this near average. Score adjusted to 0.6 (–0.1 for 1-year warranty, +0.1 for ongoing firmware support). [1][3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product direction targets scientifically relevant issues for ASMR listening: pressure management for long wear, closer-field vocal presentation, and ultra-small shells to reduce contact when side-sleeping. Lack of higher-bitrate codecs is a rational trade-off for battery/size, but does cap broadened use beyond voice-first media. [1][3]

## Advice

Buy ZE500 if your primary use is ASMR/audiobooks in bed and you value minimal bulk and silent operation (no tap tones) during sleep. For general everyday use and music versatility, the Anker Soundcore Space A40 offers broader features (ANC, LDAC, longer battery) and strong independent test results—albeit at a higher price. [4][5]
