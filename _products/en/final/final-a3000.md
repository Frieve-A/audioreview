## Overview

The final A3000 is a single dynamic driver IEM using the company’s newly designed f-Core DU unit. It houses a 6mm driver in an ABS resin shell and employs detachable 2-pin 0.78mm connectors[3]. Positioned within the A-series lineup, it aims to deliver “overwhelmingly natural sound” at an accessible price point.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurements (Crinacle) show a v-shaped response with notable upper-frequency elevation relative to neutral[1]. Deviations exceeding ±3 dB appear in multiple high-frequency regions, limiting transparency. Comprehensive public THD datasets are limited, but the manufacturer’s 18Ω impedance and 98 dB/mW sensitivity indicate easy drivability with common sources[2]. The proprietary driver is noteworthy yet does not establish clear, repeatable superiority over established alternatives in measured terms.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The f-Core DU reflects careful small-dynamic design choices (e.g., brass front housing, lightweight coil) within a mature overall implementation[3]. The ABS shell and standard 2-pin 0.78mm plug emphasize practicality and serviceability rather than bleeding-edge innovation. Investment in in-house parts is evident, but market-wide differentiation remains moderate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

At 129 USD, cheaper **equivalent-or-better** options exist. The CCA CRA offers the same core functionality (single dynamic driver with detachable 2-pin cable) and is widely measured by third parties[4][5]. Using a representative current street price of **15 USD** for the CRA, the ratio is **15 ÷ 129 = 0.12**, yielding a low CP score after rounding.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The A3000 carries a **2-year** manufacturer warranty[2]. Its simple single-DD construction and detachable cable support straightforward maintenance. Final maintains global distribution and consistent product support, though there are no exceptional warranty extensions beyond the standard. Build quality is adequate; ABS offers practical durability without premium ruggedness claims.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Final promotes measurement-guided development while delivering a consumer-friendly v-tilted tuning[1][3]. This is commercially reasonable but not fully aligned with maximizing acoustic transparency. The proprietary driver shows technical ambition, yet measured advantages sufficient to justify the pricing against strong budget competition are not clearly established.

## Advice

The A3000 fits users who specifically like Final’s brand voicing in an affordable package. If your priority is measured neutrality and raw value, strong budget competitors like the CCA CRA warrant consideration[4][5]. Listeners who prefer v-shaped signatures may enjoy the A3000; those seeking accuracy per measurements should compare alternatives.
