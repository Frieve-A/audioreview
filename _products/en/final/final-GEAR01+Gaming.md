## Overview

The final GEAR01+Gaming is a true wireless earphone jointly developed by the REB brand and final's acoustic engineers. It features an ultra-low 35ms latency gaming mode, LDAC support, hybrid ANC, and Bluetooth 5.4, covering a wide range of applications from gaming to music. Priced at 65 USD, this notable product won the VGP2024 Summer award. It is positioned as a product that aims to merge Japanese acoustic technology with gaming functionality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

This product lacks published measurement data for fundamental audio performance indicators like THD, SNR, and frequency response, which poses a risk for evaluation. However, its 35ms ultra-low latency is a scientifically valid and clearly perceptible improvement for gaming compared to the typical 100-300ms of standard Bluetooth earphones. Additionally, LDAC support enables up to 990kbps transmission, approximately three times the data volume of conventional SBC. While its basic performance is unknown, it possesses multiple, clear, and valid features for specific applications, thus earning an above-average score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The claimed joint development with final's acoustic engineers suggests a certain level of technical standards. Its support for Bluetooth 5.4 and LDAC meets modern standards, and achieving 35ms low latency requires dedicated tuning, indicating technical intervention beyond a simple OEM product. However, the basic configuration, including the 10mm organic film drivers, is a combination of existing technologies. No breakthrough proprietary technology is apparent, leading to an evaluation of a slightly above-average technical level for the industry.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The 65 USD price point represents outstanding cost-performance. Competing products that feature all of LDAC, ANC, and a low-latency gaming mode, such as the "Edifier NeoBuds Pro 2" (market price approx. 120 USD), are significantly more expensive. Compared to these alternatives, the GEAR01+Gaming offers an equivalent feature set at nearly half the price, making it effectively the world's most affordable option with this combination of functions.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While the final brand has a certain level of reliability, the GEAR01+Gaming is a new product released in October 2024, making its long-term reliability unknown. The IPX4 water resistance rating and battery life (7 hours with ANC OFF) are standard. The VGP2024 Summer award suggests a certain quality certification, but due to its launch under the emerging REB brand, there is no track record for after-sales support or failure rates. An industry-average level of support is estimated.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product has a clear concept of balancing gaming and music listening, and its technical approach is rational. The simultaneous implementation of a low-latency mode and the high-quality LDAC codec creates added value not found in conventional gaming earphones. The inclusion of hybrid ANC and a head-tracking mode also addresses modern user needs. However, the usability of switching modes via 5 taps on the right earphone is a drawback with room for improvement. Overall, the design philosophy is based on scientific rationale, avoiding non-scientific elements.

## Advice

For users who want a single device for both gaming and music, the GEAR01+Gaming is currently the most cost-effective choice. The 35ms low-latency mode excels in response-critical games, while LDAC support enables high-quality music listening. Considering that competing products with similar features cost upwards of 120 USD, the 65 USD price is a compelling advantage. However, potential buyers should be aware that fundamental audio performance data (THD, frequency response, etc.) is not available. Therefore, users who prioritize pure audio fidelity should consider this risk before purchasing.
