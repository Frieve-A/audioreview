## Overview

The Final E3000 is a wired in-ear monitor with a 6.4 mm dynamic driver in machined stainless steel, fixed cable, 16 Ω impedance and 100 dB/mW sensitivity [5][2]. Third-party frequency-response (FR) data depicts a warm, bass-elevated, treble-relaxed signature relative to neutral targets [1]. Its construction quality remains a strength, but current market pricing faces heavy pressure from budget IEMs achieving comparably neutral FR at much lower prices.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent FR measurements (IEC60318-4 coupler) show a smooth curve with modest mid-bass elevation and subdued upper treble versus IEF/Harman-style targets, yielding natural but slightly relaxed presence and air [1][6]. Comprehensive third-party distortion data for E3000 is scarce; manufacturer-level specs list 16 Ω and 100 dB/mW, indicating ordinary drive requirements rather than exceptional efficiency [5][2]. Given solid FR smoothness but audible deviations from strict neutrality and limited public THD/IMD data, a mid-high score is appropriate.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The E3000 uses a single 6.4 mm dynamic driver in a rigid stainless housing with a non-detachable OFC cable—sound engineering but conventional by today’s standards [5][2]. No advanced driver architectures, novel acoustic modules, or published patents/whitepapers are evident. Execution quality is good; originality and measurable tech ambition appear average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Current US market price observed at **54.90 USD** for E3000 [2]. The **7Hz Salnotes Zero** is functionally comparable (wired IEM, detachable cable) and achieves neutral-leaning FR per third-party measurements [4], with current Amazon listings at **22.99 USD** [3].  
**Calculation:** 22.99 USD ÷ 54.90 USD = **0.418…** → score **0.4** (rounded to one decimal).  
Rationale for equivalence: both deliver full-range wired IEM functionality; FR neutrality of Zero is equal or better per independent graphs [4]. As additional context (not used in the calculation), **Moondrop Chu II** is widely available at 22.99 USD on Linsoul and has favorable third-party measurements/reviews at ~19 USD at time of testing [6][7].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Final is an established brand with stable distribution, and retailers cite a two-year limited warranty for the E3000 [2]. Stainless housings and strain-relief ear hooks are positives, but the fixed cable limits reparability versus 2-pin/MMCX designs. Overall support signals are above average for this price tier.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The stated goal—FR smoothness grounded in acoustic engineering/psychoacoustics—is reasonable and aligns with measurement-first practice [5]. Execution prioritizes consistent tonality over feature checklists. However, given competing IEMs with equal-or-better measured FR and detachable cables at far lower prices, the value proposition of this approach is only moderately compelling in 2025.

## Advice

If you want a durable, compact bullet-style IEM with a relaxed tonality, the E3000 remains pleasant and easy to listen to. For strictly measurement-driven neutrality and value, consider **7Hz Salnotes Zero** (detachable cable, neutral-leaning FR) as the primary alternative [3][4]. Also consider **Moondrop Chu II** as another low-cost, well-measured option [6][7]. Choose the E3000 if you prioritize stainless build and brand track record over maximum price-to-performance.
