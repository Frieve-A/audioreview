## Overview

The Final E500 is positioned as an entry E-series IEM engineered for gaming/VR and binaural content reproduction, featuring a 6.4 mm dynamic driver in an ABS shell and Final’s Type-E silicone tips (five sizes). Final explicitly markets the E500 for spatial audio and directional cues, and mentions its “swing-fit” style ergonomics for secure insertion [1][2][3][4]. Core catalog specs are 16 Ω impedance and 98 dB sensitivity [1][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Third-party frequency-response databases show the E500 following a generally neutral-leaning curve with smooth treble and restrained peaks—consistent with transparent, low-fatigue reproduction for gaming and general listening [5]. However, independently verified THD/IMD and isolation figures are scarce. Given the presence of credible FR data but limited distortion/dynamic-range evidence, we assess moderate scientific validity. Catalog specifications (16 Ω, 98 dB) indicate easy drivability but do not substitute for comprehensive independent measurements [1][3][5].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Design uses established ingredients: a conventional 6.4 mm dynamic driver, ABS housing, and OFC fixed cable. The fit-stability concept (“swing-fit”) is an incremental ergonomic idea rather than a novel acoustic implementation, and there is no evidence of advanced motor/diaphragm or chamber innovations in public documentation. Overall, this reflects baseline contemporary engineering without clear state-of-the-art elements [1][2][3][4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Market price for the E500 is about 24.99 USD [3]. The Moondrop Chu II (~19.54 USD) includes a detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, metal shells, and has robust third-party FR/distortion coverage indicating equal-or-better measured performance from a user perspective (FR adherence and low nonlinear distortion; manufacturer claims <0.05% and independent lab threads corroborate strong performance) [7][8][9].  
Cost-performance calculation (USD basis): **19.54 USD ÷ 24.99 USD = 0.7819 → 0.8**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Construction is simple (few moving parts), and distribution/support are established globally. Warranty appears to vary by retailer/region (commonly 1–2 years), and build quality is consistent with Final’s E-series. Fixed cable limits field replaceability but also avoids connector failure points. No broad RMA data is available for this specific model [3][4].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A measured, neutral-leaning tuning aimed at spatial audio/gaming is a rational, measurement-aligned approach. Yet compared with competitors that pair similar or better measured outcomes with newer materials/designs at lower prices, the E500’s technical route is conservative rather than innovative [1][2][5][7][8][9].

## Advice

The E500 is a safe, neutral-leaning pick for VR/gaming and music if you prefer Final’s ergonomics/tips. For most buyers, the Chu II offers detachable cabling, sturdier shells, and stronger public measurements at a lower price—making it the more rational choice unless you specifically want the E500’s fit/brand ecosystem [7][8][9].
