## Overview

The final E2000 is an entry-level in-ear monitor using a **6.4 mm dynamic driver** in a matte-finish aluminum housing. It features the brand’s **“swing-fit”** eartip mechanism for easier sealing and fit, ships with multiple sizes of E-Type tips and **ear hooks**, and uses an oxygen-free copper cable (**non-detachable**). A representative US street price at established retailers is **about 44 USD** (Audio46 currently lists **44.17 USD**). [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Published specifications are **16 Ω** impedance and **102 dB/mW** sensitivity, appropriate for phones and USB dongles. The small 6.4 mm driver and rigid aluminum shell are sensible choices for minimizing enclosure resonances. Third-party frequency-response (FR) measurements show a generally warm/neutral balance with **slight upper-mid relaxation and a modest treble lift**, not a ruler-flat target adherence. Multiple measurements also indicate **sample-to-sample channel variance** within normal budget-class tolerances. Public THD data for E2000 is limited; no credible independent THD curves were found. [1][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This is a well-executed but conventional single-dynamic design. The swing-fit mechanism and bundled ear hooks help repeatable insertion depth and reduce microphonics when worn over-ear, yet there’s no novel transducer tech, DSP, or advanced acoustic modules beyond category norms. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Benchmarking against the **cheapest wired IEM with equal-or-better measured tonality**, the **Moondrop CHU II** is widely available at **22.99 USD** and measures closer to contemporary neutral targets than the E2000. With E2000 at roughly **44.17 USD** in the US, its measurement-per-dollar is materially weaker, hence the score. [2][3][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

final is an established Japanese brand with global distribution and standard warranty. The E2000’s aluminum shells and supple OFC cable are solid for the class. Bundled ear hooks enable over-ear wear to mitigate cable noise; the non-detachable cable is the main longevity trade-off. No widespread defect patterns are documented across major retailers. [1][2]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product reflects **acoustic-engineering-first** choices (small driver, rigid metal shell, careful venting) and **ergonomics** (swing-fit eartips, generous tip set) without resorting to pseudoscientific claims. The tuning aims at long-term listenability rather than initial “wow,” which aligns with the brand’s stated approach. [1]

## Advice

- If you value **comfort, slim shells, and a relaxed upper-mid** presentation, E2000 remains a pleasant listen.  
- If your priority is **measurement-aligned tonality per dollar**, shortlist **Moondrop CHU II** first, and also consider similarly priced “target-hugging” sets (e.g., **7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2**) depending on availability and your fit/feature needs. [4][5][6]
