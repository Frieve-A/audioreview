## Overview

The JBL Stage A130 is a 2-way passive bookshelf speaker using a 1-inch aluminum dome tweeter in JBL’s **HDI** (High-Definition Imaging) waveguide and a 5.25-inch polycellulose woofer in a rear-ported cabinet. Official specs list 55Hz–40kHz frequency response, 86dB sensitivity (2.83V/1m), 6-ohm nominal impedance, and a 3.2kHz crossover, with bass-reflex via a rear-firing tuned port [3][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Independent Klippel NFS measurements (CTA-2034-A R-2020) with the reference plane at the tweeter and the port open show behavior inconsistent with neutral reproduction: a broad bass lift centered near ~100Hz, cabinet-related resonances around ~800Hz–2kHz, and a treble swing of roughly +5dB visible in the estimated in-room response. These deviations exceed the typical ±3dB “acceptable” band for loudspeakers and are far from the ±1dB “excellent” target, so accuracy is limited even though distortion is not the primary failure mode here [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The HDI waveguide is a legitimate directivity-control approach derived from JBL’s pro lineage, and the driver/crossover topology is competent. However, beyond the waveguide the design is conventional (aluminum dome + polycellulose woofer, rear port, basic crossover). Materials and topology are sound but not leading-edge; cabinet resonance behavior seen in third-party tests further constrains realized performance [1][3][4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Review price: **179 USD**. We searched for a **cheaper** passive bookshelf speaker with **equal-or-better measured performance**. A frequently suggested option, **Sony SS-CS5** at **168 USD**, does **not** qualify: NFS data shows limited bass extension (F3 ≈ 83Hz) and notable non-linearities and cabinet resonances in the upper-mid/treble, which are not equal-or-better versus the A130’s measured behavior [2]. As we could not verify any cheaper product meeting the “equal-or-better functions and measured performance” threshold, CP is set to **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

For the United States, JBL states a **5-year warranty for non-powered speakers** (1 year for electronics). Harman/JBL’s established distribution and service footprint further supports parts and repair availability. Being a passive design, there is no firmware lifecycle to consider [5].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The product integrates a credible waveguide but the realized tuning prioritizes an energetic “smile” response rather than scientific neutrality. Given the measurable bass lift and midband resonances, the voicing appears aimed at subjective impact over transparent reproduction, which is a misalignment with fidelity-first design [1].

## Advice

If you like a lively, bass-punchy and bright presentation and plan to use room correction or EQ, the A130 can be made serviceable; sealing or partial port-stuffing plus EQ can help manage the 100Hz rise and cabinet modes [1]. For listeners prioritizing accuracy out of the box, consider speakers with demonstrably smoother CTA-2034 curves; for example, Erin specifically favors Emotiva’s Airmotiv B1+ on neutrality (note: not cheaper, so it didn’t factor into CP) [1]. Ensure adequate amplification (sensitivity ~86dB, nominal 6Ω) and consider subwoofer integration with a higher crossover if you want stronger deep-bass output.
