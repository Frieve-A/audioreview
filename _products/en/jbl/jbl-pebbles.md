## Overview

The JBL Pebbles are compact USB-powered desktop speakers aimed at simple, tidy PC audio. They use 2-inch full-range drivers inside small, circular enclosures, connect over USB for power and audio, and also include a 3.5 mm aux-in for other sources. The focus is convenience and desk footprint rather than ultimate fidelity. Basic specs list a 70 Hz–20 kHz bandwidth and 89 dB max SPL at 1 m.[1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Catalog data shows a 70 Hz–20 kHz frequency response and **89 dB maximum SPL at 1 m** (not S/N).[1] With 2-inch drivers and USB 2.0 bus power, which typically limits source current to **500 mA at 5 V (≈2.5 W)**,[6] usable output and bass extension are inherently constrained. The ~70 Hz low-end limit means true sub-bass is missing; at higher listening levels, small drivers plus limited power headroom tend to raise distortion. Absent comprehensive third-party loudness/THD plots, the catalog figures and known physical limits justify a below-average but not catastrophic score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design is conventional: small full-range drivers in ported spheres, USB audio (integrated DAC), OS-linked volume, and an aux input. There is no clear novelty in transducers, amplification, or acoustic loading beyond compactness and cable management. It meets industry-average implementation standards without notable innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Review target price:** 60 USD.  
**Cheapest equal-or-better alternative:** Creative Pebble Plus 2.1 (adds a subwoofer; 50 Hz–20 kHz FR; SNR ≥75 dB),[3] plus a low-cost USB audio dongle to match USB-digital input. Current market prices checked: **Pebble Plus 49.99 USD** (ABT)[4] + **USB adapter 8.99 USD** (Sabrent official)[5] = **58.98 USD** total → **0.983**, rounded to **1.0**.  
**Equivalence note:** Functionally matches USB-digital input (via dongle) and offers at least comparable extension (50 Hz floor vs 70 Hz for Pebbles) and higher headroom thanks to the sub.[1][3][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

JBL/Harman provides standard warranty and established support. There are no broad failure patterns specific to this model reported in manufacturer materials. With no firmware/software layer, ongoing update needs are minimal. Overall, average for the category.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product prioritizes clean desk setup and ease of use under USB power limits—scientifically reasonable given the constraints. Marketing is modest, avoiding occult claims. Within this brief, choices are rational though unambitious toward transparency-level reproduction.

## Advice

If you want fuller low-end or more headroom at similar money, the **Creative Pebble Plus 2.1** (with a tiny USB audio dongle for digital input) is a practical alternative.[3][4][5] If your priority is plug-and-play neatness and you listen at modest levels, the JBL Pebbles are fine. For materially higher fidelity, step up to powered bookshelf speakers with dedicated power supplies; expect a notably higher budget.
