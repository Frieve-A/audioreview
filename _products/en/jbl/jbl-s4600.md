## Overview

The JBL S4600 is a 3-way floor-standing passive loudspeaker released in September 2007. It features a 35cm LE14H-4 woofer, a 5cm 175Nd-3 compression driver, and a 19mm 138Nd compression driver, achieving a frequency range of 35Hz to 40kHz (-6dB). It incorporates SonoGlass horn technology inherited from JBL's higher-end models. The original retail price was 3067 USD (per unit), and new-old-stock units currently trade for around 6,800 USD (pair).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The S4600's frequency response of 35Hz to 40kHz (-6dB) was respectable by 2007 standards, but it is a mediocre specification by modern high-performance active monitor standards. Due to its passive design, it lacks active crossovers, DSP-based phase correction, and room correction functions, which are standard features in contemporary studio monitors. Detailed performance data such as THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and SNR are not publicly disclosed, making objective performance evaluation difficult. It is highly likely that its performance is inferior to the transparency-level specifications (e.g., THD below 0.1%) achieved by the latest active monitors.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Aqua-Plas reinforced pure pulp cone of the LE14H-4 woofer and the pure titanium diaphragms in the compression drivers were advanced material choices for their time. The design philosophy of eliminating unwanted resonances with the SonoGlass horn is also commendable. However, its core technology, the passive crossover, is technically inferior to modern, precisely controlled active crossovers using DSP. It completely lacks the technological innovations that are standard in today's studio monitors, such as digital inputs, room correction, and integrated optimization of drivers and amplifiers. From a 2025 technical standpoint, it must be considered obsolete.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

For its new-old-stock price of 6,800 USD (pair), there are products that surpass the S4600 in every acoustic performance metric for less money. For example, the Neumann KH 310 A (approx. 5,000 USD pair) is a 3-way active monitor with a frequency response down to 34Hz (-3dB), offering superior low-frequency extension. Considering its active design, low-distortion characteristics, and optimized performance, the S4600 is a cost-inefficient choice. Cost-performance calculation: 5,000 USD ÷ 6,800 USD = 0.735 → 0.7. Since superior performance can be achieved for about 70% of the price, its cost-performance is rated as low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

JBL is a long-established brand in the audio industry and has a certain level of basic reliability. However, the S4600 was discontinued in 2007. Now, more than 18 years later, there are significant constraints on the availability of original spare parts and maintenance support. Its passive design means no firmware updates are necessary, but it also means there is no possibility for functional improvements. Even when purchased as new-old-stock, the manufacturer's warranty is limited, leaving concerns about long-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The S4600's design philosophy is based on passive speaker technology from 2007, which is irrational from the perspective of a modern studio workflow. The need for a separate high-quality power amplifier increases the total cost and installation complexity. It lacks any of the scientific sound quality improvement features that modern active monitors provide as standard—such as room correction, digital inputs, and integrated amplifier-speaker design—making its design philosophy outdated.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the S4600, a comparison with modern high-performance active studio monitors is strongly recommended. With a similar budget of 6,800 USD, you can purchase the Neumann KH 310 A (approx. 5,000 USD pair), a 3-way active monitor that outperforms the S4600 in every aspect, and still have money left over. Alternatively, choosing the Genelec 8341A (approx. 6,700 USD pair) provides a state-of-the-art coaxial design with SAM technology for automatic room calibration, creating a far more accurate monitoring environment. Unless there is a strong attachment to its historical value or specific tonal character, there is no rational reason to choose the S4600 in 2025. For scientifically superior acoustic performance, one should select a product that adopts the latest active monitor technology.
