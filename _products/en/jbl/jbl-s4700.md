## Overview

The JBL S4700 is a large-format 3-way floorstanding loudspeaker that represents JBL's approach to high-end consumer audio technology. Built upon professional-grade technology from the acclaimed Project K2 S9900 series, the S4700 features a 15-inch cast-frame woofer with dual voice coils, a 1.75-inch titanium compression driver, and a 0.75-inch titanium compression driver with Bi-Radial horn loading. Housed in a furniture-grade cherry wood veneer enclosure measuring 42.1" × 19.7" × 14.6" and weighing 120 pounds, the S4700 exemplifies JBL's traditional approach to large-scale loudspeaker design. Originally priced at 10,000 USD each (MSRP), the model has been recently discontinued.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. Despite extensive research, no credible third-party measurements (THD, IMD, detailed frequency response, S/N ratio) were found for the JBL S4700. While manufacturer specifications list basic parameters like frequency response (38Hz-40kHz at -6dB) and sensitivity (94dB), these lack the precision and independence required for proper scientific evaluation. According to the evaluation framework, when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The S4700 demonstrates solid professional-grade speaker technology with in-house development capabilities. JBL's proprietary compression driver and horn technology, derived from the Project K2 S9900 professional series, represents mature and proven engineering. The dual titanium compression drivers with Bi-Radial horn loading and 15-inch cast-frame woofer with dual 3-inch voice coils and neodymium motor showcase appropriate technical sophistication for a high-performance loudspeaker. However, the technology represents established approaches rather than cutting-edge innovation, lacking modern DSP integration or AI-enhanced features that characterize contemporary high-end designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Equipped with equivalent 94dB sensitivity, 15-inch woofer, and 3-way configuration, the Cerwin-Vega SL-15 provides equivalent user-facing functionality as a large 3-way floorstanding speaker with similar efficiency. CP = 799 USD ÷ 8,250 USD = 0.097, rounded to 0.1. Both speakers feature 15-inch woofers, 94dB sensitivity, and 3-way design delivering comparable performance characteristics. The SL-15's 400W power handling and 28Hz-26kHz frequency response provide equivalent basic performance parameters. The substantial price differential of over 10:1 demonstrates extremely poor cost-performance, as equivalent efficiency and driver configuration can be obtained at a fraction of the cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The S4700 benefits from JBL's established support infrastructure with a 5-year warranty for non-powered speakers, exceeding the industry standard of 2 years. JBL provides global support through Harman with comprehensive customer service including phone support and established repair networks. The robust construction featuring cast-frame drivers and internally braced cabinet design supports long-term reliability. JBL's 75+ year manufacturing history demonstrates strong reliability track records. However, the recent discontinuation of the model creates uncertainty about long-term parts availability, and the 120-pound weight presents practical challenges for service calls.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

JBL demonstrates scientific rationality through measurement-based development approaches, including Linear Spatial Reference Technology that measures 1296 times more information than single on-axis response curves. The design philosophy emphasizes professional validation through real-world studio applications and proven Project K2 technology transfer to consumer products. High-quality components including titanium compression drivers and cast-frame woofer construction directly contribute to performance objectives. The 3-way design with specialized drivers provides appropriate frequency range coverage and horn loading offers measurable efficiency benefits. The compression driver approach represents rational engineering for high-efficiency applications. While lacking modern DSP integration, the analog design philosophy maintains signal path simplicity and avoids potential digital processing artifacts.

## Advice

The JBL S4700 represents a specialized approach to high-end loudspeaker design that may appeal to users seeking professional-grade compression driver technology in a consumer format. The unique combination of large-format drivers, horn loading, and JBL's professional heritage offers distinctive characteristics for high-efficiency applications. However, potential purchasers should consider the lack of independent measurement data for performance verification, the recent discontinuation status affecting long-term support, and the substantial space and power requirements. The 8,250 USD current market price represents extremely poor value when equivalent 94dB sensitivity and 15-inch 3-way configuration can be obtained from alternatives like the Cerwin-Vega SL-15 at 799 USD, delivering the same basic performance parameters at over 10 times lower cost.
