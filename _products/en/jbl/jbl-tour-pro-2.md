## Overview

The JBL Tour Pro 2 is a true wireless earbuds model released in spring 2023. Its most distinctive feature is the smart case equipped with a 1.45-inch touchscreen display, enabling setting changes and music playback control without using smartphone apps. Featuring 10mm dynamic drivers and True Adaptive Noise Cancelling technology, it entered the market at approximately USD 250 USD price point. This product represents JBL's attempt to establish a premium position in the true wireless earbuds market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The JBL Tour Pro 2 incorporates 10mm dynamic drivers with JBL Pro Sound acoustic design. Tuning based on the Harman Target curve aims for scientifically proven acoustic characteristics that satisfy the majority of listeners. True Adaptive Noise Cancelling technology uses four noise-sensing microphones to adapt to environments in real-time. However, actual measurements show limited effectiveness against low-frequency noise such as train engine sounds. Testing alongside moderately busy roads reveals that while general traffic noise is reduced, individual vehicle sounds and other intrusive noises remain audible. The product lacks support for high-resolution codecs like LDAC and aptX, supporting only AAC and SBC.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The smart case equipped with a 1.45-inch touchscreen display represents innovative technical implementation in the industry. The 6-microphone crystal call algorithm enhances call quality even in noisy and windy environments. Bluetooth 5.3 support ensures stable connections while JBL Spatial Sound provides spatial audio experiences. Personal Sound Amplification enables left/right balance adjustment and conversation volume amplification of 15-20dB. However, the lack of support for high-resolution audio codecs (LDAC, aptX) falls short of 2025 technical standards. The case weight of 2.6oz is relatively heavy, potentially affecting portability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The JBL Tour Pro 2 has a market price of approximately 250 USD. A competing product with equivalent or superior functionality is the Sony WF-1000XM5 (approximately 300 USD). The Sony WF-1000XM5 provides superior noise cancellation performance, LDAC support, and higher audio quality characteristics, achieving equivalent or superior user-oriented performance. Cost performance = 250 USD รท 300 USD = 0.84, resulting in a 0.8 evaluation. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 (approximately 249 USD) also offers excellent spatial audio and ANC performance in the same price range, indicating intense competitive environment.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JBL, as a Harman International (Samsung subsidiary) brand, provides an established support system. The touchscreen functionality of the smart case is innovative, but durability data for long-term use is limited. Battery performance is excellent, offering 8 hours with ANC on and up to 40 hours total playback with case. IPX5 water resistance ensures protection against sweat and light water exposure. The 6-microphone system for call quality enhancement is practical and effective for communication in noisy environments. Firmware updates are continuously provided, suggesting reliable long-term product support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The touchscreen smart case represents a rational approach enabling setting changes without smartphone app dependency. Tuning based on the Harman Target curve reflects scientifically grounded acoustic design philosophy. True Adaptive Noise Cancelling's real-time environmental adaptation is theoretically rational. Personal Sound Amplification provides practical value as a hearing assistance feature. However, the lack of support for high-resolution audio codecs (LDAC, aptX) shows inconsistency in design philosophy for a 2025 premium product. The increased case weight is acceptable as a trade-off for touchscreen implementation but undeniably affects portability.

## Advice

The JBL Tour Pro 2's primary attraction is its innovative touchscreen smart case. This feature appeals to users who value the ability to adjust settings frequently without retrieving their smartphones. While audio quality provides standard performance, it falls short compared to similarly priced Sony WF-1000XM5 or Apple AirPods Pro 2 in pure acoustic performance.

For users prioritizing ANC performance, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II or Sony WF-1000XM5 offer superior choices. The JBL Tour Pro 2's ANC provides moderate performance, with particularly limited effectiveness against low-frequency noise. However, battery life is excellent, with up to 40 hours of playback suitable for extended use.

For those prioritizing technical audio quality, we recommend selecting products with LDAC support. The JBL Tour Pro 2 supports only AAC and SBC, preventing users from benefiting from high-resolution audio. However, if you value the innovative smart case functionality and good battery performance, this product warrants serious consideration.

When considering purchase, it's important to clarify whether you prioritize the smart case innovation or pure acoustic performance. The former makes this product suitable, while the latter suggests considering competing products.
