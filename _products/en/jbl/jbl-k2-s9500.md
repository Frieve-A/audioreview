## Overview

The JBL K2 S9500 was a 1990s Project K2 flagship. It uses a four-module tower (base B95, LF modules 2000M/3000M, MF/HF module 4500M) arranged vertically to approximate a coaxial acoustic center. Manufacturer engineering documentation lists 97 dB sensitivity (2.83 V/1 m), 3 Ω nominal impedance (2.7 Ω min), and a −6 dB half-space bandwidth of 35 Hz–21 kHz; archival spec pages list a hefty 149 kg weight, reflecting its pro-influenced, horn-loaded design ethos [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent, modern full-spin measurements are not available. Using manufacturer engineering data: frequency response 35 Hz–21 kHz (−6 dB, half space), sensitivity 97 dB (2.83 V/1 m), nominal impedance 3 Ω, minimum 2.7 Ω [1]. Horn loading and the virtual-coaxial geometry are acoustically rational. However, the lack of third-party measurements (e.g., full spin, distortion, directivity) keeps confidence moderate, and the low impedance may challenge some amplifiers [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

For its era the S9500 applied advanced mechanics (pin-disk centering, modular construction) and materials (Aquaplas-treated 1400Nd woofers, titanium-diaphragm 475Nd compression driver). Relative to current flagships, it predates modern simulation-driven waveguides, comprehensive spin-based voicing, and contemporary crossover optimization, so the technical approach feels dated even if still impressive [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better today): Klipsch R-800F.** Passive floorstander; **frequency response 34 Hz–21 kHz (±3 dB)** and **sensitivity 98 dB (in-room)** meet or exceed the S9500’s **35 Hz–21 kHz (−6 dB, half-space)** and **97 dB** on headline axes (conditions differ; **manufacturer specs** for both) [1][3].  
Observed price **624.99 USD each** → **1,249.98 USD/pair** (authorized retailer) [4].  
**CP calculation:** 1,249.98 USD ÷ 14,000 USD = **0.089** → score **0.1**.

> Equivalence note (user-visible axes): both are passive floorstanders; bandwidth and sensitivity are **equivalent-or-better** per manufacturer specs. This comparison is **provisional** due to the S9500’s limited third-party measurements. [1][3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This is a discontinued, ~35-year-old design with no factory warranty or parts pipeline. The multi-module mechanics add service complexity. While build quality was substantial, age-related issues (crossover capacitors, foams, adhesives) and the 3 Ω load reduce practical support prospects [1][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Efficiency, headroom, and pattern control via horn loading are rational choices for high-output listening. The virtual-coaxial vertical symmetry also targets imaging consistency. That said, the mass/complexity emphasis reflects 1990s priorities more than today’s measurement-centric optimization, where simpler enclosures often achieve comparable linearity with modern tools [1][2].

## Advice

Collectors who specifically want 1990s JBL horn dynamics and the historical K2 lineage will value the S9500. If you prioritize verifiable neutrality per contemporary measurements and manufacturer support at a far lower outlay, current models like Klipsch’s R-800F provide clearer, warrantied value. For any S9500 purchase, inspect driver condition, crossover health, and all module interfaces.
