## Overview

The JBL Tune 215BT is a Bluetooth 5.0 neckband wireless earphone featuring 12.5 mm dynamic drivers. It offers up to 16 hours of battery life with short-time charging and basic functions such as voice assistant support. As an entry-level model retailing around 19 USD (based on current market price), it delivers solid functionality for the price.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications list frequency response of 20Hz–20kHz, sensitivity of 118 dB SPL @ 1 kHz / 1 mW, and impedance of 20 Ω [2]. The product incorporates 12.5 mm dynamic drivers, Bluetooth 5.0, multi-point connection for two devices, up to 16 hours playback, and USB Type‑C charging [1]. As third-party measurements of THD+N, frequency response deviation, or crosstalk are not confirmed, and measurement performance is unknown, the score is set to the neutral 0.5 per policy. Key audibility-related numeric specs currently available are catalog values: FR 20Hz–20kHz, sensitivity 118 dB SPL, impedance 20 Ω [2], driver size 12.5 mm, battery 16 h, charge time ~2 h [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product employs a standard configuration with 12.5 mm dynamic drivers and Bluetooth 5.0, representing industry-average technological implementation. The 16-hour battery life and short-time charging (USB‑C, approx. 2 h full charge) are practical but do not constitute a unique advantage [1]. The neckband design prioritizes practicality, with no apparent proprietary advances in the drivers or circuitry; it largely uses standard OEM components.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price example: approximately 19 USD (based on Amazon.co.jp price at access time) [2]. We searched for the world's cheapest product with equal‑or‑better user‑facing functions and performance (multi‑point connection to two devices, ≥16 h battery life, USB‑C charging; BT 5.0) and did not find any cheaper alternative. Therefore, the cheapest equal‑or‑better option is this product itself, and CP is 1.0 by definition [1][2].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

One-year manufacturer warranty is provided (region‑typical) and domestic support is available [2]. Long-term durability is likely price-appropriate, and replacement may be more practical than repair in some cases. As app or firmware update support is not confirmed specifically for this model, it is not included in the rationale.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The product emphasizes practical use with 16-hour battery life and short-time charging. Bluetooth 5.0 with multi‑point supports modern multi‑device environments, and the neckband form reduces loss risk [1]. Water resistance is not included, but the function–price balance is reasonable. Due to insufficient independent measurement data, acoustic performance cannot be quantitatively verified beyond catalog values.

## Advice

The JBL Tune 215BT is suitable for users seeking a neckband design with multi‑point and ~16‑hour battery life around 19 USD (based on Amazon.co.jp price at access time) [2]. If longer battery life and water resistance are priorities, other models may be preferable; if sound quality with wired connection is acceptable, wired IEMs can be considered.
