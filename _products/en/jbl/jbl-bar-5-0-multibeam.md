## Overview

The JBL Bar 5.0 MultiBeam is a compact all-in-one soundbar rated at 250 W total power with five 48×80 mm racetrack drivers (three front-firing, two side-firing) and four 75 mm passive radiators. It supports HDMI eARC and virtual Dolby Atmos, and includes Automatic MultiBeam Calibration (AMC) plus Chromecast built-in, AirPlay 2, and Alexa Multi-Room Music. There are no up-firing height drivers or separate surrounds; height effects are virtualized. DTS decoding is not supported. [2][3][1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent measurements show low distortion at moderate levels (Weighted THD @ 80 dB ≈ 0.32), maximum SPL around 91.9 dB, and a low-frequency extension of ~51.9 Hz. Stereo frequency-response standard error is ~3.38 dB—respectable for a single-bar design, but not “transparent.” Overall, speech clarity is solid while deep-bass “rumble” is limited, consistent with an all-in-one bar without a subwoofer. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

JBL’s MultiBeam beamforming and AMC room calibration are sensible, proprietary approaches for widening the soundstage and normalizing in-room response on an affordable bar. However, height is virtual (no up-firing channels), codec support omits DTS, and connectivity is otherwise conventional. This places the implementation around industry-average sophistication. [2][3][1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better option)**: **Sony HT-S2000** — compact 3.1 all-in-one bar with virtual Atmos **and DTS:X**, discrete center, similar measured mid-bass reach (LFE ~55.8 Hz) and low distortion (@ 80 dB ≈ 0.34). Current street price **USD 299.99** (Sony/Best Buy). By the policy formula: **299.99 USD ÷ 349 USD = 0.86 → 0.9**. Functions are equal-or-better from the user view (adds DTS support) with comparable measured core performance. [4][5][6]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Build quality is good for the class, but JBL’s consumer warranty in the U.S. is **1 year** (electronics), which is below the two-year norm some rivals offer. Global support is established via Harman, and firmware features are modest. Overall reliability/support is slightly above baseline due to simple, all-in-one construction but held back by the warranty term. [1][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing single-bar convenience, room auto-calibration, and beamforming is a rational, measurement-led way to improve TV audio without extra boxes. The trade-offs—no discrete heights/surrounds, no DTS—are consistent with the target size/price. As executed, the direction is sensible and avoids pseudoscience, though ultimate transparency is limited. [2][1]

## Advice

Choose the Bar 5.0 MultiBeam if you want a tidy, one-piece upgrade with credible dialogue clarity, simple eARC hookup, and app-free casting (Chromecast/AirPlay). Skip it if you need strong sub-50 Hz bass or DTS playback; in that case the Sony HT-S2000 is the value benchmark at ~300 USD, and a bar-plus-sub package will outperform both on low-end impact.
