summary: "The JBL Reflect Flow Pro is a sports-focused true wireless earbud featuring IP68 waterproofing and active noise cancellation. While it offers excellent fit and water resistance, the USD 179.95 price point lacks justification given limited performance and feature advantages over numerous equivalent lower-priced alternatives."

## Overview

The JBL Reflect Flow Pro is a true wireless earbud developed by American audio manufacturer JBL. Released in 2021, it was positioned as a sports-focused model featuring IP68 waterproof rating and active noise cancellation functionality. It incorporates 6.8mm dynamic drivers and features JBL's signature sound. The PowerFins system with four sizes ensures stable fit during intense physical activities. The product has been discontinued and is currently difficult to obtain in the market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Features 6.8mm dynamic drivers with measured 20Hz-20kHz frequency response. SoundGuys measurements show characteristics close to target curve in mid and high frequencies, while exhibiting significantly emphasized low-frequency response. Active noise cancellation performance demonstrates approximately 50% noise reduction in low-frequency bands, which falls below industry average. Bluetooth codec support is limited to AAC and SBC only, lacking high-quality codec support. Battery life measures 9 hours 8 minutes (with ANC enabled) in actual testing, slightly exceeding the claimed 8-hour specification. IP68 waterproof rating allows submersion up to 1.5m depth for 30 minutes, though this does not contribute to sound quality improvement.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The 6.8mm dynamic driver technology represents industry-standard performance without notable innovation. Active noise cancellation technology employs six-microphone beamforming, but measured performance ranks below similarly-priced competitors. While IP68 waterproof rating achievement represents technical accomplishment, numerous products from other manufacturers also meet this standard. Bluetooth 5.0 adoption was standard at release time but appears outdated by current technical standards. The PowerFins mounting system proves practical but cannot be considered innovative technology. Overall design represents combination of existing technologies without breakthrough innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The JBL Reflect Flow Pro is priced at USD 179.95 (approximately USD 180). The primary equivalent-function competitor is the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC (USD 79), which features IPX4 water resistance, ANC functionality, equivalent battery life, AAC/SBC codec support, plus LDAC support, superior ANC performance (98.5% noise reduction), and superior measured audio quality (MDAQS 4.9/5 rating, excellent harmonic distortion performance). CP = USD 79 รท USD 180 = 0.44. While the lower-priced EarFun Air Pro 3 (USD 80) offers equivalent functionality, audio quality measurements reveal excessive bass emphasis and distortion issues, making the JBL Reflect Flow Pro superior in sound quality. However, pricing remains excessive relative to performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JBL brand reliability is high with global support infrastructure. Products include standard 1-year warranty and support firmware updates through the JBL Headphones app. However, discontinuation as of 2024 raises concerns about long-term support availability. IP68 waterproof rating ensures high physical durability and reliability for sports use. While specific data on general failure rates for battery degradation and connection issues is not publicly available, JBL product failure rates are typically industry-average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sports-focused design philosophy is rational, incorporating IP68 waterproof rating, PowerFins for stable fit, and six-microphone array for improved call quality, all aligned with intended use cases. Active noise cancellation functionality also contributes to improved focus during exercise. Qi-compatible wireless charging capability is practical. However, bass-heavy acoustic tuning is questionable for sound quality-focused design. Additionally, lack of high-quality codec support despite premium pricing undermines design philosophy consistency. While rational as sports-specific design, optimization for general music listening is lacking.

## Advice

The JBL Reflect Flow Pro appeals to sports enthusiasts who prioritize IP68 waterproof performance and stable fit. However, the USD 179.95 price point is clearly excessive relative to its performance and features. Equivalent water resistance, ANC functionality, and battery life are available in products costing half the price, making this unviable from a cost-performance perspective. Current discontinuation makes acquisition difficult. For those considering purchase, we recommend equivalent-performance alternatives like the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC or EarFun Air Pro 3. The Anker product particularly offers superior sound quality advantages through LDAC support. Unless brand loyalty to JBL is paramount, choosing alternative manufacturers represents the rational decision for cost-performance-focused users.
