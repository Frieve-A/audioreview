## Overview

The JBL 4305P is a compact, self-contained powered loudspeaker system in JBL’s Studio Monitor line. It combines a 5.25-inch JW130P-4 woofer and a 2410H-2 compression driver on an HDI waveguide with onboard Class-D amplification (125W LF + 25W HF per speaker) and a 24-bit/192kHz DAC. Connectivity covers Chromecast built-in, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.1, USB-B, optical S/PDIF, 3.5mm analog, and a combo XLR/TRS balanced input, plus a sub out with 80Hz high-pass engage [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specs state 45Hz–25kHz (-6dB) frequency response and 90°H × 60°V dispersion from 2kHz–20kHz [2]. Third-party Klippel NFS data from Erin’s Audio Corner shows generally well-controlled directivity and a competent on-axis/listening-window response with some irregularity near the ~1.7kHz crossover region [1]. Wireless inter-speaker link supports up to 24-bit/96kHz; USB/S/PDIF accept up to 24-bit/192kHz [2]. Distortion and maximum output are typical for a small two-way powered monitor; the 5.25-inch woofer limits clean SPL versus larger competitors [1]. Net: borderline-transparent behavior for a compact active speaker.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design employs JBL’s patented 2410H-2 compression driver and HDI waveguide geometry, finite-element-optimized for controlled directivity [2]. Integration of DSP crossovers, multi-input digital/analog I/O, and mainstream network protocols (Chromecast, AirPlay 2) into a compact powered monitor reflects a high degree of system engineering. While not revolutionary, the in-house horn/driver platform and polished integration merit a high technology score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Street price is 2200 USD for the pair. The **cheapest equivalent-or-better route** we could identify is: Kali LP-6 V2 pair (199 USD each; 398 USD pair) providing comparable or better low-frequency extension and neutral response per independent measurements [3][5], **plus** a WiiM Pro Plus network streamer-DAC (219 USD) that restores integrated streaming/remote functionality with excellent measured line-level performance [4].  
**Computation:** 398 USD + 219 USD = **617 USD**.  
**CP:** 617 USD ÷ 2200 USD = **0.28** → **0.3** (rounded to one decimal).  
Equivalence note: the combo covers the same user-facing functions (streaming, analog/digital inputs via the streamer, volume/remote) and meets or exceeds the speaker system’s FR/THD envelope for typical nearfield use [3][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Retailer-published warranty terms commonly list **5 years** for enclosure/drivers and **2 years** for electronics on the 4305P, which is industry-average for active monitors [6]. Build uses MDF with real-wood veneer and front ports; electronics add complexity and additional failure points versus passive speakers [2]. No public MTBF data has been disclosed. Overall reliability/support outlook is average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Priorities mix rational elements (HDI directivity control, DSP, all-in-one convenience) with less efficiency-oriented choices (premium cabinetry and vintage styling that do not directly improve measurements). Bundling streaming increases price and reduces modularity versus pairing neutral monitors with a low-cost, high-performance external streamer-DAC. Sound-quality progress is achieved mainly through established horn/DSP practice rather than novel breakthroughs.

## Advice

If you want a neat, furniture-grade, streaming-ready monitor system with controlled directivity, the 4305P delivers that experience. If your goal is **measured transparency per dollar**, a Kali LP-6 V2 pair plus a WiiM Pro Plus streamer-DAC offers equivalent functionality and objectively competitive performance at roughly **28%** of the 4305P’s price [3][4][5]. Users needing higher output or deeper bass should consider larger active monitors and/or adding a subwoofer via the 4305P’s autosensing sub out.
