## Overview

The JBL Studio 680 is a 2.5-way floor-standing loudspeaker with dual 6.5-inch PolyPlas woofers and a 1-inch 2414H-1 compression driver loaded by an HDI (High Definition Imaging) waveguide. Manufacturer specifications list 38 Hz–40 kHz frequency response (±3 dB), 88 dB sensitivity (2.83 V/1 m), 6 Ω nominal impedance, dimensions 1005 × 230 × 300 mm, and per-unit mass ≈22.6 kg [1].  
**US street price (pair): 1,319.90 USD** (derived as 659.95 USD each ×2) [2][7].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Public third-party Klippel NFS/CTA-2034 measurements for Studio 680 could not be found at major measurement-first outlets as of this writing; therefore performance assessment relies on clearly labeled manufacturer specifications: 38 Hz–40 kHz (±3 dB), 88 dB (2.83 V/1 m), 6 Ω, and HDI waveguide/compression-driver topology [1]. Until independent data (on-/off-axis response, early reflections, PIR, nonlinear distortion) is published, this is a provisional score based on catalog specs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JBL’s HDI waveguide with a compression driver is a proven approach to controlling directivity and maximizing listening-window uniformity, and the 2.5-way network reflects competent engineering for this class [1]. Materials and topology are solid but not bleeding-edge; no onboard DSP/correction or novel transducer tech is present. Overall, a capable contemporary implementation rather than a technology leader.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Studio 680 pair price (US): 1,319.90 USD** (659.95 USD each ×2) [2][7].  
The cheapest clearly **equal-or-better** alternative we identified is **Monoprice Monolith THX-365T** (passive mini-tower with Atmos module). It has strong independent measurements (Spinorama flatness ≈ ±1.8 dB; bass extension ~74 Hz) from NFS data [3][5] and **THX Ultra certification** [6]. **THX-365T pair price (US): 799.98 USD** (399.99 USD each ×2) [4].  
Cost-performance ratio (cheapest equal-or-better ÷ target):

799.98 ÷ 1319.90 = 0.606 → **0.6** (rounded to one decimal).

*Equivalence note:* Both are passive floor-standing speakers; the 365T adds an Atmos top module and demonstrates equal-or-better measured linearity/directivity on third-party rigs [3][5].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Typical 2-year warranty and global Harman service coverage; passive construction minimizes electronic failure points. PolyPlas cones and rubber surrounds are durable; compression drivers are robust in pro applications. No extended-warranty program is standard; overall reliability provisioning is above average but not class-leading.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design pursues controlled directivity and adequate sensitivity with conventional passive networks and materials. This aligns with high-fidelity goals, but omits newer approaches (e.g., built-in DSP/room correction) that can further push audible transparency; thus the philosophy is reasonable yet conservative.

## Advice

If you specifically want JBL’s HDI voicing and compression-driver dynamics in a compact tower, the Studio 680 is coherent. Objectively, though, measured-data leaders like Monolith THX-365T deliver comparable or better linearity/directivity for substantially less money [3][4][5][6]. For maximum value, prioritize models with published CTA-2034 (Spinorama) and low distortion; if Studio 680 measurements appear and confirm transparency, its scientific validity score should be revisited.
