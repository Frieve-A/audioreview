## Overview

The JBL Studio 698 is a 3-way floorstanding loudspeaker featuring JBL’s High Definition Imaging (HDI) waveguide with a 1-inch compression driver (2414H-1), a 6-inch PolyPlas midrange and dual 8-inch PolyPlas woofers in a rear-ported enclosure. Key specs: 36 Hz–40 kHz bandwidth, 90 dB sensitivity (2.83 V/1 m), and 6 Ω nominal impedance. [6]

**Price (pair, denominator for CP): 1,998 USD**（based on 999 USD each at representative retailer）. [5]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Third-party Klippel NFS data show **good overall linearity and output**, with a **slight high-treble dip** and a **mid-bass rise around ~80 Hz**. Horizontal directivity is well controlled by the HDI waveguide, aiding consistent in-room response; on-axis aiming is recommended, and adding subwoofers improves output below ~50 Hz. These findings are consistent with the catalog sensitivity (90 dB) and bandwidth claims. [1][6]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A modern compression driver on an HDI waveguide with a dedicated mid and dual woofers is solid, rational engineering focused on controlled directivity and room-friendly dispersion. Execution is competent rather than category-defining.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Target price (pair): 1,998 USD.** We searched for the **cheapest option with equal-or-better user-facing functions and measured performance**. The **Polk Reserve R700**—a dual-8-inch tower with verified **±≈2 dB** listening-window linearity and ~40 Hz F3—lists at **1,099 USD each → 2,198 USD/pair** in the US market. Because this **exceeds 1,998 USD/pair**, **no cheaper equivalent exists in USD**, so **CP = 1.0** (clamped). [1][2][7]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JBL (Harman) provides a **5-year warranty for non-powered speakers** and a global support network. The passive 3-way topology and mature driver tech suggest sound long-term reliability. [3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Prioritizing **controlled directivity** via HDI and a compression driver is a rational path to stable in-room tonality. The measured mild voicing (upper-treble dip, mid-bass lift) trades strict neutrality for fullness—reasonable but not fully “transparent.”

## Advice

Toe-in **on-axis** to the main seat; keep **~60 cm or more from boundaries** to temper the ~80 Hz rise. If you want more “air,” a **gentle high-shelf EQ** can restore top-end energy. For large rooms/cinema, **add subwoofers below ~50 Hz**. Use an amplifier stable into **4–6 Ω** with adequate current. [1]
