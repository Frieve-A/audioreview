## Overview

The JBL Flip 5 is a portable Bluetooth speaker introduced in 2019. It features IPX7 waterproofing, a racetrack-shaped 44 mm driver with passive radiators, and a rated 20 W amplifier in a compact 18.1 × 6.9 × 7.4 cm body. It targets outdoor and travel use where ruggedness and strong bass are prioritized over stereo imaging.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Third-party measurements show mixed fidelity for absolute transparency. RTINGS reports a **standard error of 3.76 dB** in frequency-response accuracy and **low-frequency extension of 68.3 Hz**, with **max SPL ~85.5 dB** under their standardized test [3]. SoundGuys notes a **~2–8 dB bass lift** below middle-C, reflecting consumer-tilted tuning [4]. Tom’s Guide measured **~96 dB** at the limit but with **audible distortion**, with cleaner listening nearer ~85 dB [2]. The **mono architecture** precludes stereo separation, limiting spatial fidelity irrespective of EQ. Manufacturer specs list **65 Hz–20 kHz**, **Bluetooth 4.2**, and **S/N > 80 dB** [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Design uses established techniques (single full-range driver + passive radiators). Waterproofing is solid (IPX7) but standard. **Bluetooth 4.2** is dated versus current 5.x stacks that improve range and latency [1]. The JBL Portable app offers basic EQ, but the overall implementation remains conventional.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Current market price: **USD 90**. The **Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM 3** provides equal-or-better user functions and measured results (stereo playback; IP67; **FR error ~2.71 dB; max SPL ~86.9 dB**) at **USD 79.00** from a mainstream retailer [5][6].  
**Calculation:** 79 USD ÷ 90 USD = **0.88** → rounded to **0.9**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Backed by Harman/JBL’s typical one-year warranty and widely available service. Field reliability of the Flip series is generally acceptable for outdoor use; no systemic defects are evident from credible lab data.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Prioritizing portability, ruggedness, and bass impact is reasonable for the intended use. However, the mono-only driver compromises spatial accuracy, and the dated Bluetooth stack limits connectivity advantages. The design choices are pragmatic but not optimized for transparent reproduction.

## Advice

If you value rugged build, simple operation, and punchy bass in a small tube, Flip 5 remains enjoyable. If stereo, better measurement scores, or dust resistance matter at similar or lower cost, consider **UE WONDERBOOM 3**. If you want a JBL with newer radio and 2-way driver, step to **Flip 6**; if you need bigger sound and power-bank features, **Charge 5/6** are more suitable.
