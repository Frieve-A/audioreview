## Overview

The JBL PRX835 is a 15-inch, three-way powered main loudspeaker with built-in Wi-Fi for PRX Connect app control. It uses a 1500-watt class-D amplifier to drive a 15-inch woofer, 6.5-inch horn-loaded mid, and 1.5-inch compression driver. The official spec lists a 90°×50° pattern and a net weight of 71.4 lb (32.38 kg). This model is now discontinued, but remains available at some retailers as new stock [1][2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent third-party measurement data could not be confirmed at this time; evaluation is therefore based on manufacturer specifications (provisional) [1][2]. The PRX835 is specified at 138 dB peak maximum SPL and 42 Hz–20 kHz (±3 dB) in Normal mode (Boost preset: 39 Hz–20 kHz, ±3 dB), with a nominal 90°×50° coverage [1][2]. These numbers indicate competent full-range performance for PA mains, but without verified distortion data and standardized third-party on/off-axis measurements, claims of transparency cannot be substantiated beyond catalog specs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design combines a three-way active topology with DSP, Wi-Fi control, and dbx Type IV limiting—solid, industry-standard techniques rather than novel breakthroughs [1]. The PRX Connect app provides remote control of levels, 8-band parametric EQ, and up to 50 ms speaker delay, supporting practical system optimization [1]. Implementation is competent, but not at the cutting edge of current pro loudspeaker technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

At 1659 USD for a single unit, current market pricing is confirmed at a major U.S. retailer [3]. A cheaper alternative with broadly similar user-facing functionality is Electro-Voice’s EKX-15P at 1049 USD [6]. **Equivalence note (provisional):** both are powered 15-inch mains with DSP and nominal 90° horizontal coverage; EKX-15P’s peak SPL (134 dB) is within a ±5% window of the PRX835’s 138 dB, though JBL’s low-frequency extension is stated more favorably and EV’s frequency figures are given at different tolerances (EV: 55 Hz–18 kHz, −3 dB / 48 Hz–20 kHz, −10 dB; JBL: 42 Hz–20 kHz, ±3 dB / 39 Hz–20 kHz, ±3 dB Boost) [1][2][4][5]. Weight favors EV (53.9 lb vs 71.4 lb), which is beneficial for mobile use [1][4].  
**Simple calculation:** 1049 ÷ 1659 = 0.63 → rounded to 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

JBL cites a rigorous 100-hour power test and provides an authorized global service network, with product documentation, firmware/app links, and service resources still hosted despite discontinuation [1]. The platform’s track record in the field and continued app availability support a strong—though not perfect—reliability and support assessment [1][3].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

A three-way active configuration specifically targets midrange clarity and controlled directivity—rational aims for PA mains. The inclusion of remote EQ and delay aligns with measurable, venue-tuning improvements. While the approach is evolutionary, not disruptive, it is grounded in scientifically meaningful parameters and practical deployment considerations [1][2].

## Advice

If you need a three-way powered main with remote DSP control, the PRX835 remains a capable option when found new. For buyers prioritizing cost, portability, and broadly similar real-world output, the EV EKX-15P is substantially less expensive, notably lighter, and suitable for many gigs—acknowledging JBL’s stronger published LF extension and slightly higher peak SPL [1][2][4][5][6]. Confirm inventory status and pricing locally before deciding.
