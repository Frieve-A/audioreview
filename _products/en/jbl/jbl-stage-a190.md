## Overview

The JBL Stage A190 is a 2.5-way floorstanding loudspeaker featuring dual 8-inch polycellulose woofers and JBL's High-Definition Imaging (HDI) waveguide technology. Positioned as JBL's flagship tower in the Stage series, the A190 incorporates a 1-inch aluminum dome tweeter with crossover points at 1.4kHz and 2.0kHz. As of 2025, the official list price on JBL.com is 499.95 USD per speaker (often shown as sold out) [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The JBL Stage A190 achieves moderate scientific validity given currently available public data. Manufacturer specifications list frequency response 36Hz–40kHz and sensitivity 91dB (2.83V/1m) [1]. A review from a reputable publication notes JBL-provided response behavior around the 1.4kHz/2kHz crossover region but does not publish full third-party measurement datasets [2]. As comprehensive independent measurements (e.g., full spin data, THD vs SPL) are not publicly established, scoring starts from 0.5 per policy, with numeric specs recorded as manufacturer figures [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The A190 incorporates JBL's HDI waveguide technology, representing above-basic engineering. The 2.5-way design with aluminum dome tweeter and polycellulose woofers shows competent implementation. The crossover design allows the lower woofer to roll off at 1.4kHz while the upper woofer continues to 2kHz before the tweeter takes over. While not industry-leading, the technology level exceeds simple off-the-shelf designs and demonstrates reasonable engineering principles for the price point.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Price basis (as of the review date): 499.95 USD per speaker on the official site [1]. Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator identified: Polk Monitor XT70 at 299 USD per speaker on the official site [3]. Equivalence note: dual-woofer tower with 1-inch dome tweeter and extension to beyond 40kHz (Hi-Res certification), delivering equal-or-better user-facing functionality; third-party measurements are available for XT70 [4]. CP calculation (USD basis): 299 USD ÷ 499.95 USD = 0.598 → 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

JBL maintains standard warranty coverage and support infrastructure typical of major audio manufacturers. The established global service network provides support for Stage series products via authorized channels. Standard manufacturer warranty terms apply and vary by region; see JBL warranty information for details [5]. The company's track record with the Stage series indicates reasonable long-term reliability for the segment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Stage A190's design approach demonstrates moderate rationality with HDI waveguide implementation and appropriate driver selection. The 2.5-way configuration addresses common crossover challenges in budget towers, though implementation shows some compromises typical of price-point constraints. The aluminum dome tweeter and polycellulose woofer combination represents established engineering principles. However, the design prioritizes affordability over optimal acoustic performance, with some measured irregularities indicating areas where further development could improve fidelity.

## Advice

The JBL Stage A190 offers reasonable value for buyers seeking dual 8-inch tower performance. The HDI waveguide technology and competent frequency response make it suitable for medium to large rooms. If seeking alternatives with different dispersion philosophies, consider horn-loaded options from competitors. For JBL enthusiasts, the A190 provides the brand's signature characteristics with adequate build quality. Ensure proper placement and room acoustics to optimize crossover behavior and overall presentation.
