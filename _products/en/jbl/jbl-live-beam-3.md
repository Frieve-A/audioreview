## Overview

The JBL Live Beam 3 are true wireless earbuds notable for LDAC support and a Smart Charging Case featuring an approximately 1.45-inch touchscreen. They include 10mm dynamic drivers, active noise cancelling (ANC), multipoint, and app integration (EQ/control customization). The earbuds are rated IP55 (case IPX2 class). Claimed battery life is up to about 12 hours (ANC off), with quick charging enabling hours of playback from roughly 10 minutes of charge.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Core specifications (LDAC, ANC, FR range, etc.) are published, but third-party measured data for THD/THD+N, SNR, crosstalk, dynamic range, and ANC attenuation remain limited. Therefore, audibility-level transparency cannot be validated, leading to a mid-level score. While LDAC raises transmission capability, final transparency depends on driver/housing/tuning with substantiating measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Beyond LDAC, ANC, multipoint, and app EQ/control, the touchscreen Smart Charging Case provides user-interface differentiation. Although detailed papers/measurements for the driver and ANC algorithms are scarce, breadth of implementation and usability enhancements justify an above-average technical score. Measurement attainment remains unclear, so we avoid a higher score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

We define the comparable feature set as LDAC + ANC + multipoint + a touchscreen-equipped case. Among current products, we find no clearly cheaper product meeting or exceeding this set (e.g., JBL Tour Pro 2 with a similar smart case is at a higher/similar price band). Therefore, CP = 1.0. For price reference, we assume around 199 USD (roughly 29,000円) street price; with no cheaper equivalent alternatives, CP is maxed.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As a Harman brand, JBL has established global distribution and support. The earbuds’ IP55 (case IPX2 class) rating, firmware/app support, and standard warranty indicate a solid baseline. Long-term RMA statistics are limited, but brand track record suggests above-average support quality.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While published measurements remain sparse for validating auditory transparency, LDAC, ANC, and the usability-forward smart case indicate a practical, user-centered engineering direction. A bass-leaning commercial tuning may persist, yet the investment direction is rational from a utility standpoint.

## Advice

If you want LDAC, ANC, multipoint, and case-side controls without pulling out your phone, this is a fitting choice. If you prioritize abundant third-party measurements and proven auditory transparency, consider alternatives with richer published data. Fit and ANC effectiveness vary by individual, so auditioning is recommended. With few cheaper substitutes offering this exact feature set, it is a strong candidate for utility-focused use cases.
