## Overview

The JBL Live Pro 2 is a mid-range true wireless earbuds model released in 2022. It features 11mm dynamic drivers with JBL Signature Sound acoustic design. Characterized by True Adaptive Noise Cancelling functionality and up to 40 hours of battery life, it entered the market at approximately USD 150 USD price point. This product aims to provide equivalent performance to premium brands like Apple, Bose, and Sony at a more accessible price. It also includes practical features such as IPX5 water resistance and wireless charging support.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The JBL Live Pro 2 incorporates 11mm dynamic drivers with JBL Signature Sound acoustic tuning. True Adaptive Noise Cancelling technology adjusts ANC performance in real-time according to environmental conditions. Measurements confirm effective blocking of background noise such as bus engine low-frequency rumble. The V-shaped acoustic profile balances bass impact with high-frequency clarity. The companion app enables audio quality adjustment through parametric EQ and presets. The Check My Fit feature uses microphones to measure audio leakage and ensure optimal fit. However, it falls short of achieving complete silence compared to higher-priced products like the Sony WF-1000XM4.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 11mm dynamic drivers are large for this price range, achieving excellent acoustic characteristics. The 6-microphone beamforming system enhances call quality and enables effective noise cancellation. Multipoint Bluetooth connectivity allows simultaneous connection to two devices. The application enables one-touch settings for various music genres and creation/storage of custom settings. IPX5 water resistance ensures protection against sweat during exercise and light rain. The Speed Charge feature provides 4 hours of playback with 15 minutes of rapid charging. However, it lacks support for latest high-resolution codecs like LDAC and aptX.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The JBL Live Pro 2 has a market price of approximately USD 150 USD (about 22,000 yen). A competing product with equivalent or superior functionality is the Sony WF-1000XM4 (approximately USD 280 USD, about 41,000 yen). The Sony WF-1000XM4 provides superior noise cancellation performance, LDAC support, and higher audio quality characteristics, but costs approximately 1.9 times more than the JBL Live Pro 2. The JBL Live Pro 2 provides equivalent performance in user-oriented features including 8 hours continuous playback, up to 40 hours total battery life, multipoint connectivity, IPX5 water resistance, and wireless charging support. Cost performance = 22,000 yen รท 41,000 yen = 0.54, but considering battery performance and practical features, it earns a 0.8 evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JBL, as a Harman International (Samsung subsidiary) brand, provides an established support system. Battery performance is exceptional, offering 8 hours continuous playback even with ANC enabled, and 6 hours continuous use in adaptive mode. IPX5 water resistance maintains wearing position during yoga classes and light 30-minute jogging while ensuring protection against sweat and water splashes. The oval-shaped ear tips provide comfortable fit, but may slip out of ears if proper fit isn't achieved. Firmware updates and long-term support are continuously provided, maintaining high product reliability levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

True Adaptive Noise Cancelling technology's real-time environmental adaptation represents a rational approach reducing user burden. The 40-hour maximum battery life addresses long-duration usage needs. Multipoint connectivity enables practical design for multiple device usage. Detailed equalizer settings in the companion app allow audio quality adjustment according to personal preferences. The 6-microphone beamforming system for call quality enhancement rationally addresses remote work era needs. However, lack of support for high-resolution audio codecs (LDAC, aptX) shows inconsistency in design philosophy considering 2025 technical standards.

## Advice

The JBL Live Pro 2 is an optimal choice for users prioritizing battery performance and cost-effectiveness. The 40-hour maximum battery life provides significant advantages for long-distance travel and continuous use. ANC performance is excellent for this price range, delivering sufficient effectiveness for daily noisy environments.

In terms of sound quality, the V-shaped sound profile balances bass impact with high-frequency clarity. Detailed equalizer adjustment in the companion app enables audio quality customization according to personal preferences. Multipoint connectivity allows simultaneous connection to smartphones and computers, making it useful in remote work environments.

However, for users seeking the highest audio quality, we recommend considering higher-priced products like the Sony WF-1000XM4 or Apple AirPods Pro 2. These products offer superior noise cancellation performance and high-resolution audio codec support.

When considering purchase, it's important to clarify whether you prioritize the balance of price and battery performance or seek the highest audio quality and ANC performance. For the former priority, the JBL Live Pro 2 represents an excellent choice. With IPX5 water resistance, it's suitable for sports use and demonstrates high practicality in daily usage.
