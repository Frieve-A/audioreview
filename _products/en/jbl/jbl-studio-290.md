## Overview

The JBL Studio 290 is a 3-way floorstanding speaker featuring a 1" CMMD Lite dome tweeter, 4" PolyPlas midrange driver, and dual 8" PolyPlas woofers. Originally part of JBL's Studio 2 series from 2013–2016, this speaker represented JBL's consumer-oriented approach during that period. The model appears to be effectively discontinued with extremely limited availability in current markets, existing primarily in the used speaker marketplace.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Studio 290 achieves basic functionality with a frequency response of 38Hz–22kHz (–6dB, manufacturer) and 91dB sensitivity (manufacturer) [1]. Recommended amplifier power is 20–225W (manufacturer) [1]. Credible third-party full spin or standardized THD data are not widely available. Based on manufacturer specifications, transparency-oriented performance cannot be verified beyond basic bandwidth and sensitivity. The 3-way design with dual 8" woofers provides extension to 38Hz, which is moderate by current standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Studio 290 reflects 2013-era design choices (PolyPlas cone drivers, CMMD Lite tweeter, rear-ported bass reflex) without notable innovations now common in current products (e.g., waveguided aluminum tweeters with modern crossover optimization, extensive Klippel-guided refinement). Competitive for its era, but surpassed by today’s best engineering practices.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

At 599 USD per speaker (denominator), the cheapest **equivalent-or-better** finished product we identified is JBL’s own Stage A190. It offers the same user-facing role (floorstanding tower) and manufacturer-published performance that is **equal or better**: frequency response 36Hz–40kHz and sensitivity 91dB [2]. The current list price is 499.95 USD each [3].  
Calculation: CP = MIN(1.0, 499.95 ÷ 599) = 0.83 → 0.8.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a discontinued model, new-unit availability and official support are limited. While general construction appears adequate for long-term use, lack of ongoing parts/program support increases risk relative to current models.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product embodies straightforward, conventional engineering for the time (3-way, dual-woofer, rear port). It avoids overtly irrational claims but also omits modern, measurement-driven refinements. Rational but dated.

## Advice

New purchases at full retail are not recommended. If you need a new tower with similar or better on-paper performance and current support, prioritize JBL Stage A190 (equal-or-better bandwidth and sensitivity at a lower price) [2][3]. Consider Studio 290 only at substantial used-market discounts, and factor the absence of official support into total cost of ownership.
