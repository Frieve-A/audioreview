rating: [2.1, 0.6, 0.7, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3]
price: 65000
summary: "Former flagship dual-15-inch horn system using beryllium compression drivers and battery-biased (“charge-coupled”) passive networks. Tremendous headroom and controlled directivity, but extremely poor cost-performance versus cheaper designs that match or exceed measured capability."

## Overview

JBL’s Project Everest DD66000 is an “augmented two-way” floorstander: one 15-inch woofer covers bass to ~150 Hz, another woofer extends to 700 Hz, then a large Bi-Radial horn with a 4-inch beryllium compression driver handles mids/highs; an ultrahigh-frequency beryllium driver is added above 20 kHz [1][2]. Key specs (manufacturer): frequency response 45 Hz–50 kHz (–6 dB), bass extension 32 Hz (–10 dB), sensitivity 96 dB (2.83 V/1 m), nominal 8 Ω, recommended amplifier 100–500 W [1][2]. Dimensions are **38 in H × 43-5/8 in W × 18-1/2 in D**; weight ~302 lb per speaker without grille [1]. The DD66000 is discontinued; the later DD67000 succeeded it [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent lab measurements of the DD66000 are scarce; this section therefore relies on manufacturer documentation (provisional) [1][2]. Published specs indicate wide bandwidth (45 Hz–50 kHz, –6 dB) with –10 dB bass at 32 Hz, high sensitivity (96 dB/2.83 V/1 m), and crossover points at 150 Hz, 700 Hz, and 20 kHz [1][2]. These values suggest strong headroom and controlled dispersion from horn loading, but they do not by themselves demonstrate within-band on-axis linearity approaching ±1 dB or consistently low distortion across the audible range. In the absence of verified third-party THD/IMD and CTA-2034 data, we set scientific validity slightly above mid-pack.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The system integrates high-end transducer engineering (476Be/045Be-1 beryllium compression drivers, alnico-motor 1501AL woofers), Bi-Radial horns for directivity control, and **battery-biased (“charge-coupled”) passive networks** intended to minimize dielectric hysteresis in capacitors [1][2]. The augmented two-way topology (dual 15s with a 700 Hz handoff) targets wide dynamics with a single mid crossover [2]. Lack of modern DSP/active alignment limits recency, but materials, motor design, and horn work reflect substantial know-how.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better):** **JTR Noesis 212RT (pair)** — passive floorstander with dual 12-inch woofers and a large coaxial compression driver on a constant-directivity waveguide; third-party measurements show a flat listening-window response (roughness roughly within ±2 dB) with well-behaved directivity, and manufacturer specs list high sensitivity and very high output capability [3][4]. Bass extension is comparable (≈35 Hz at ±3 dB; ≈30 Hz at –10 dB in free space) [3][4].

- **Price basis:** 4,299 USD each (8,598 USD/pair) from manufacturer [3].  
- **Why equivalent-or-better:** passive tower; similar or deeper practical low-frequency extension with high sensitivity and constant-directivity behavior; third-party polar/CTA-style data indicate excellent linearity and pattern control [4].

**CP calculation (USD):** 8,598 USD ÷ 65,000 USD = **0.132** → **0.1** (rounded to one decimal).  

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Harman/JBL states **5 years** for non-powered speakers in the U.S. (1 year for most other categories) [5]. The DD66000 is a passive loudspeaker with no firmware, aiding long-term serviceability; however, the model is discontinued and uses proprietary components (e.g., 476Be, 1501AL), so long-horizon parts availability is uncertain outside factory channels. Global support exists via Harman’s network, but specialized parts/repairs may require authorized service.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Pursuing very high sensitivity and controlled directivity via large horns and beryllium drivers is technically coherent. However, heavy cabinetry and exotic materials add substantial cost without evidence of commensurate **measured** transparency gains versus modern, much cheaper systems with verified linearity and pattern control; omission of DSP/active alignment further reduces rational efficiency of the spend [1][4].

## Advice

Room sizing and placement are critical given the **43-5/8 in width** and rear ports [1]. Follow JBL’s 100–500 W amplifier recommendation and ensure robust current delivery into 8 Ω nominal loads [2]. If your priority is maximum dynamics with horn directivity and the design/art value, the DD66000 delivers. If your priority is **objective performance per dollar**, alternatives like the JTR 212RT provide equivalent or better measurable performance for a fraction of the price [3][4].
