## Overview

The JBL Stage 200P is a 10-inch powered subwoofer designed as an entry-level complement to JBL's Stage 2 series speakers. Featuring a front-firing polycellulose driver with dual rear ports and 150W RMS (300W peak) amplification, it targets budget-conscious consumers seeking basic home theater bass enhancement. Available in Espresso and Latte finishes to match the Stage series aesthetic, the 200P represents JBL's attempt to provide accessible subwoofer performance at a competitive price point.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications (official spec sheet) state frequency response 32–150 Hz (±3 dB), amplifier power 150 W RMS / 300 W peak, variable low‑pass 50–150 Hz, phase control, and line‑level/LFE RCA input [1]. Dimensions 13.8 × 14.2 × 15.2 in and weight 31.8 lb are listed by major retailers and align with the product documentation [4]. No independent laboratory measurements (THD, SNR, maximum SPL vs distortion, detailed in‑room/anechoic FR) were found as of the review date. Therefore, the evaluation remains provisionally based on manufacturer specifications pending third‑party data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The 200P employs conventional subwoofer technology including a polycellulose cone driver, Class D amplification, and ported enclosure design. The variable crossover control (50-150Hz) and automatic power management represent standard features. The dual rear-firing ports with flared design aim to reduce port noise, though this approach is widely implemented across the industry. Overall technology level reflects typical budget subwoofer engineering without notable innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator: Klipsch R-120SW (12-inch driver, 200 W RMS / 400 W peak, FR 29–120 Hz; comparable features and equal‑or‑better output capability) [2][3]. Current market prices on review date: comparator 299.00 USD [2]; review target 439.95 USD [4]. Calculation (required disclosure): 299.00 USD ÷ 439.95 USD = 0.68 → rounded to 0.7. Rationale for equivalence (user perspective): both are powered home subwoofers with line/LFE input, adjustable low‑pass/phase, and overlapping usable bandwidth; R‑120SW offers a larger driver and higher amplifier rating [3].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

JBL maintains established distribution channels and standard warranty coverage typical of major audio manufacturers. The company provides adequate customer support infrastructure with service centers in major markets. As a Harman International subsidiary, JBL benefits from corporate resources for parts availability and technical support. Reliability expectations align with industry average for budget-oriented powered subwoofers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Stage 200P follows conventional subwoofer design principles without occult audio claims or scientifically questionable approaches. However, the design prioritizes visual integration over performance optimization, resulting in modest specifications relative to price point. The choice of 10-inch driver over larger alternatives limits ultimate output capability. Design philosophy emphasizes aesthetic coordination with the Stage series rather than maximizing measured performance metrics or cost-effectiveness.

## Advice

The Stage 200P suits buyers prioritizing visual integration with JBL Stage 2 speakers over optimal cost-performance. The Klipsch R-120SW offers superior driver size and amplification at lower cost. For dedicated performance seekers, consider higher-performance options like the SVS SB-1000 Pro. The 200P's primary advantage lies in finish matching rather than superior acoustic performance or value proposition.
