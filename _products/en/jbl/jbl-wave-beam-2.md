## Overview

The JBL Wave Beam 2 are true wireless earbuds with 8 mm dynamic drivers, active noise cancelling (ANC), Ambient Aware/TalkThru transparency, multipoint connection, and Bluetooth 5.3. The earbuds carry IP54 dust/water resistance while the case is IPX2. Battery life is up to about 40 hours with ANC off (10h earbuds + 30h case) and up to about 32 hours with ANC on (8h + 24h). In Japan, the direct price is 54 USD, offering essential features at an entry price.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comprehensive third-party measurements are limited. As an entry TWS, deviation from flat within 20 Hz–20 kHz ±3 dB is expected. ANC is class-standard and helps reduce low-frequency noise. With IP54 passive isolation plus ANC, meaningful reduction of unwanted sound at the eardrum is expected, but transparent-level performance (±0.5 dB class) is not the design goal. Claims align with specifications without unscientific promises.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

It combines 8 mm dynamic drivers, ANC, multipoint, IP54, and app EQ—technologies becoming standard in this price band. There is no high-bitrate codec (aptX/LDAC) or advanced architecture, and technical uniqueness is small, but the implemented features map well to user value. Overall, industry-average achievement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Comparison basis is "current products with equivalent or better user-facing functions (ANC, multipoint, IP rating, app) at the cheapest market price." Against the 54 USD direct price in Japan, we could not confirm a clearly cheaper current alternative with equivalent or better functions from primary sources. Per policy, the CP score becomes 1.0 in this case.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a major brand, JBL provides established sales and warranty support. IP54 environmental tolerance, Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, and domestic authorized channels suggest adequate day-to-day practicality. With limited time on market and no long-term RMA data yet, we maintain a neutral score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Within a price-first segment, allocating resources to ANC, transparency, multipoint, and ingress protection—features that matter for perceived listening conditions—is rational. Without high-bitrate codecs or top-tier ANC, and without targeting transparent-level measurements, the approach is sensible but not ambitious; thus slightly above mid-level.

## Advice

If you need ANC, multipoint, and IP54 at an entry price, Wave Beam 2 is a strong pick. If you prioritize high-bitrate codecs, stronger ANC, wear detection, or wireless charging, consider stepping up to higher-tier models. When auditioning, check case handling, fit with your ear shape, and transparency behavior to ensure it matches your use cases.
