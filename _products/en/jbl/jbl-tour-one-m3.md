## Overview

The JBL Tour One M3, released in Japan on May 29, 2025, is JBL's flagship ANC headphones. Its most distinctive feature is the "Smart Case" (available with the Smart Tx model), where the charging case itself functions as a Bluetooth transmitter, enabling wireless playback from non-Bluetooth devices. It is packed with premium features, including hybrid noise cancelling with real-time compensation, Hi-Res audio support via LDAC, and spatial sound. While it boasts high-quality sound reproduction through its 40mm drivers, its audio profile requires some adjustment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Although the 40mm drivers claim a wide 10Hz-40kHz frequency response, measurements reveal a significant dip in the 3kHz-7kHz range. This band is crucial for human hearing, manifesting as clearly perceptible issues in "clarity, presence, and definition." The hybrid noise-cancelling with real-time compensation is a scientifically sound approach, achieving effective noise reduction. While the ANC performance provides a measurable improvement, the default frequency response issues result in a moderate rating for overall scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The "Smart Case," which turns the charging case into a touchscreen-equipped Bluetooth transmitter, is a truly innovative technology. It allows for wireless transmission from wired audio sources without a separate dongle. The product incorporates advanced industry technologies, including readiness for next-gen Bluetooth (LE Audio), spatial sound, and high-performance noise cancellation via a multi-microphone system. The 24-bit/96kHz Hi-Res support is also technically excellent. The only concern is the lack of basic frequency response optimization despite these advanced features, but the pure technology level is among the top in the industry.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

With a market price of 365 USD (for the Smart Tx model), its competitor with similar key features, the Sony WH-1000XM5, is available for around 280 USD. The calculation is `280 USD รท 365 USD = 0.766`. While the Sony model also offers high-performance ANC, LDAC, and spatial audio, JBL's Smart Case provides unique, hard-to-replace value for wireless playback from wired devices. Considering this unique added value, the price difference is justifiable, making the cost-performance favorable.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JBL is a veteran brand in the audio industry with an established warranty and support system. In addition to a standard one-year warranty, it offers repair services through a nationwide network. As the Smart Case is a complex, multifunctional system, its long-term reliability is somewhat unknown, but JBL's track record is at the industry average, and support from the established brand can be expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The development of ANC based on measurement data and real-time compensation is a scientifically rational approach. The support for wired devices via the Smart Case is also a practical solution that addresses real user needs. LDAC and Hi-Res audio support contribute to measurable improvements in sound quality. However, the default frequency response issue indicates a flaw in the design philosophy; the fact that "high-frequency intensity is recovered with an EQ preset" proves that the intended acoustic design relies on post-processing. While the technical innovation is commendable, the lack of basic acoustic tuning results in a moderate rationality rating.

## Advice

When considering the JBL Tour One M3, the deciding factor is whether the Smart Case functionality is essential for you. If you have a specific need to wirelessly connect to wired audio sources, such as in-flight entertainment or gym equipment, this product's uniqueness is highly valuable. However, if your top priority is pure sound quality, you must be prepared to use EQ adjustments to address the default frequency response characteristics. In the same price range, the Sony WH-1000XM5 offers a more balanced sound out of the box, but the JBL is a viable option if you are attracted to its innovative features. Its ANC performance is excellent, making it well-suited for noise cancellation-focused use.
