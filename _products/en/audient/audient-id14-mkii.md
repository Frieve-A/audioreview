## Overview

The Audient iD14 MkII is a 10-in/6-out USB-C audio interface featuring two Class-A microphone preamps derived from Audient's console heritage. This updated version offers improved dynamic range, enhanced connectivity, and full bus-powered operation compared to the original iD14. With professional-grade converters delivering 126dB dynamic range and comprehensive I/O including ADAT expansion, the iD14 MkII targets home studios and professionals requiring high-quality recording capabilities.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The iD14 MkII achieves transparent-class results on key outputs while approaching transparency on microphone inputs. Line outputs (DAC) specify 125.5dB A-weighted dynamic range, THD+N 0.0006% at -1dBFS, and frequency response within ±0.1dB from 10Hz to 40kHz. The ADC specifies 120dB A-weighted dynamic range, THD+N 0.001% at -1dBFS, and ±0.5dB from 10Hz to 40kHz. Microphone preamps deliver THD+N 0.00170% at 0dBu, SNR 101dB A-weighted, gain range 58dB, and frequency response ±0.5dB 10Hz–40kHz. Headphone outputs specify 125.5dB A-weighted dynamic range, THD+N 0.0009%, and ±0.25dB 10Hz–40kHz with up to 223mW at 30Ω and 100mW at 600Ω. These values meet or exceed the transparent thresholds for DAC/line/headphone paths, with mic preamp SNR close to the 105dB benchmark [1]. Independent reviews also report noise-free operation consistent with the specs [2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Audient’s discrete Class-A console-derived mic preamp topology and the measured converter performance indicate solid modern engineering. USB-C with full bus-powered operation and loopback support address current workflows, and ScrollControl adds useful DAW integration. While performance is excellent for the class, it does not set absolute state-of-the-art records in 2025.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Market price for the iD14 MkII is 399.99 USD [6]. No cheaper product was found that offers an optical ADAT input (10-in/6-out expansion capability) with equal-or-better measured performance and user-facing functions. Representative alternatives with ADAT input such as PreSonus Studio 1824c (524.99 USD) and Focusrite Scarlett 18i16 4th Gen (549.99 USD) are more expensive [4][5]. Accordingly, no cheaper equivalent exists; CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Audient provides standard industry warranty coverage with established support infrastructure. The all-metal construction ensures durability, and the company has a solid reputation in professional audio. Firmware updates are available for enhanced functionality, though update frequency is moderate compared to some competitors. The interface benefits from Audient's console heritage and established presence in professional audio markets, providing confidence in long-term support availability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audient's approach prioritizes measured audio performance with Class-A preamp topology that delivers scientifically verifiable improvements in noise floor and distortion characteristics. The focus on console-derived circuitry represents rational engineering targeting measurable performance parameters. USB-C implementation and bus-powered operation address modern connectivity needs efficiently. The inclusion of comprehensive I/O with ADAT expansion provides genuine utility for expanding systems. Design decisions consistently target measurable audio quality improvements rather than marketing-driven features.

## Advice

For users prioritizing absolute audio quality and Class-A preamp character, the iD14 MkII delivers excellent performance with measured specifications exceeding transparency thresholds. The interface excels in professional recording applications where the additional I/O and expansion capabilities justify the price premium. However, budget-conscious users should consider the MOTU M2, which offers comparable core functionality at significantly lower cost. The iD14 MkII makes most sense for users who specifically value Audient's console-heritage preamps and require the expanded I/O configuration.
