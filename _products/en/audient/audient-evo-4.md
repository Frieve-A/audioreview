## Overview

The Audient EVO 4 is a compact 2-input 2-output USB audio interface developed by Audient, a renowned British console manufacturer with a long history. The company has leveraged decades of experience in professional mixing consoles to pursue uncompromising sound quality even in consumer products. The EVO 4 houses high-quality AD converters and low-noise microphone preamplifiers in a palm-sized enclosure, supporting 24bit/96kHz for transparent recording. The proprietary SmartGain feature automates recording level optimization, making it a practical design suitable for users ranging from beginners to professionals.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The EVO 4's measured performance is extremely excellent for its price range. THD+N of 0.0015% significantly exceeds the transparent level (0.01% or below), and dynamic range of 113dB surpasses the transparent level (105dB or above). Frequency response achieves the transparent level at 10Hz-40kHz Â±0.5dB, while crosstalk of -105dBu greatly exceeds the standard (-70dB or below). The S/N ratio of 100dB falls slightly short of the transparent level (105dB) but remains at a practically acceptable level. CMRR is also good at 85dB or above, and overall measurement results well below the audible threshold demonstrate high scientific validity in terms of fidelity to master sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The EVO 4 incorporates high-quality AD converters and low-noise design microphone preamplifiers, achieving technical standards above industry average. The proprietary SmartGain feature shows technical ingenuity by improving practicality through automatic recording level optimization. The implementation of JFET instrument input is also appropriate. However, rather than revolutionary new technology, it represents a proper combination of existing excellent technologies and does not reach industry-leading standards. While the design capability to achieve high performance in a compact enclosure is commendable, technical breakthroughs are limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The EVO 4's market price is 154 USD. As a competing product with equivalent 2-input 2-output configuration, no cheaper alternative with equivalent or superior measured performance exists. The Behringer UMC202HD (71 USD) is less expensive but inferior in measured performance, so it is not a valid comparison. While compared to the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 4th Gen (180 USD), the EVO 4 is less expensive, providing excellent absolute cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Audient has a long track record as a professional audio equipment manufacturer, and product reliability is above industry average standards. The company provides standard warranty periods and support systems, with no particularly high number of failure reports from users. However, since the EVO 4 itself is from a relatively new product line, long-term reliability track record is limited. Firmware update support is also appropriately handled, though it cannot be considered industry-leading support infrastructure. Overall, it provides above-average peace of mind compared to industry standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The EVO 4's design philosophy represents an extremely rational approach focused on scientific sound quality improvement. The design aimed at achieving transparent-level measured performance realizes faithful recording rather than subjective sound coloration. The SmartGain feature represents a scientific approach to recording level optimization, contributing to improved practicality. Miniaturization of the enclosure is also a rational decision adapted to modern mobile recording environments. The development policy that concentrates resources on measurable performance improvements without relying on unscientific audio myths is highly commendable. This design philosophy realistically addresses the demand for balancing compact design with high performance.

## Advice

The EVO 4 achieves excellent measured performance and usability, with superior cost-performance. Since no cheaper alternative with equivalent or superior measured performance exists, it is a rational choice for users seeking a 2-input 2-output interface. The advantages lie in the usability of the SmartGain feature and refined design, making it suitable for users who prioritize pure recording performance. It is recommended for those who value brand prestige and operability, and for those seeking high performance on a budget, this product is highly advisable.
