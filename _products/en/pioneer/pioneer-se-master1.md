## Overview

The Pioneer SE-Master1 is Pioneer's first high-end headphone, announced in 2015 after six years of development. It is handcrafted in limited production of 1,000 units at Pioneer's Tohoku factory in Japan, with skilled craftsmen producing only two units per day. The headphone features a 50mm aluminum diaphragm with ceramic coating and claims a wide frequency response of 5Hz to 85,000Hz. It was released at a price of 1727 USD after tuning at Air Studios.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Measured data reveals significant deviations from ideal frequency response, including bass roll-off and approximately 10dB spike around 15kHz. While the 45Ω impedance and 94dB sensitivity specifications are standard, and ribbed diaphragm processing is implemented to reduce distortion, specific THD+N values are not disclosed. The open-back design provides virtually no isolation, making it susceptible to external ambient noise. The 85,000Hz reproduction capability far exceeds human audible range and cannot be considered a scientifically meaningful improvement. Compared to modern monitoring headphones, objective acoustic performance advantages are limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The ceramic coating technology on the 25μm thick aluminum diaphragm shows originality, and the handcrafted production process involving over 100 steps demonstrates technical capability. However, the diaphragm technology itself is an extension of existing approaches and cannot be considered innovative design. The 50mm diameter driver is industry standard, and no technical breakthroughs in measured performance are confirmed. While Air Studios tuning provides added value, it does not contribute to fundamental improvements in technical level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Against the 1727 USD price point, the Audio-Technica ATH-R70x (approximately 200 USD) delivers equivalent or superior basic acoustic performance, except for the challenging drive requirements due to its 470Ω high impedance. While the SE-Master1 offers easier drive capability with 45Ω design, even considering this convenience, cost-performance remains low. Calculation: 200 USD ÷ 1727 USD = 0.116. Additionally, the product is currently discontinued, making new units difficult to obtain, with used market prices ranging from approximately 933 to 1400 USD, raising questions about the original price setting's validity. Since the rarity value from handcrafted production does not directly correlate with acoustic performance improvement, the pure performance-to-price ratio receives extremely low evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

While quality control as a Japanese handcrafted product can be expected, difficulties in parts procurement and repair support are anticipated due to limited production. Pioneer's audio division faces uncertainties in long-term support structure following business changes after the Onkyo & Pioneer integration. The production pace of two units per day makes securing replacement units during repairs difficult, and given the specialized maintenance requirements of handcrafted products, there are more reliability and support challenges compared to conventional products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The pursuit of 85,000Hz reproduction capability far exceeds the audible range and lacks scientific foundation. Creating rarity value through handcrafted production does not directly correlate with sound quality improvement, rather becoming a cost-increasing factor. The creation of exclusivity through limited production is unrelated to the essential value of audio equipment - acoustic performance improvement. The adherence to traditional handcrafted methods without utilizing modern digital signal processing technology or cost reduction through mass production cannot be considered a rational design philosophy.

## Advice

For those considering purchase at the 1727 USD price point, we strongly recommend comparison with other manufacturers' products in the same price range. Products such as Sony MDR-Z1R (approximately 1433 USD), Sennheiser HD800S (approximately 1433 USD), and Focal Utopia demonstrate superiority in measured data. Additionally, products like Audio-Technica ATH-R70x (approximately 200 USD) are available at significantly lower prices while offering comparable basic acoustic performance. Unless attracted to the added value of handcrafted production and limited production, we cannot recommend this product from a cost-performance perspective. Before purchase, it is important to conduct listening tests and carefully determine whether there is a sound quality difference that justifies the price difference.
