## Overview

The VSX-S520 is an ultra-slim 5.1-channel AVR (about 2.75-inch tall). It offers 4 HDMI inputs/1 output (ARC), 4K/60p 4:4:4 pass-through with 1080p→4K upscaling, built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/Chromecast/AirPlay, and MCACC auto calibration. High-res playback includes FLAC/WAV/ALAC 192 kHz/24-bit and DSD 2.8/5.6 MHz [1]. Official firmware updates exist, with records including AirPlay 2 support and service stability fixes through 2021 [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Manufacturer specs cite **50 W/ch (4Ω, 1 kHz, 1.0% THD, 2 ch)** / **80 W/ch (4Ω, 1 kHz, 1.0% THD, 1 ch)** [1]. Absent full-band, low-distortion third-party measurements (20 Hz–20 kHz, low THD+N), audible transparency cannot be established. Still, this is a conventional AVR without pseudo-scientific claims. Net: **borderline problem level → 0.3**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Integrating streaming (Chromecast/AirPlay) and MCACC in a very slim chassis is sensible engineering [1]. However, no HDMI 2.1/8K or eARC, and room EQ is basic by current standards. Competent but not cutting-edge → **0.4**.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Denominator (this unit’s market price):** 499.95 USD (ABC Warehouse) [3].  
**Cheapest equal-or-better alternative:** **Denon AVR-S570BT** (5.2 ch, 70 W @ 8Ω, 20–20 kHz, 0.08% THD, HDMI 2.1/8K/eARC) **plus** **Chromecast with Google TV (4K)** to match built-in streaming. Prices: **399 USD** [4] + **49.99 USD** [5] = **448.99 USD**.  
**Equivalence note:** Same 5.x use case; S570BT exceeds video I/O and publishes stricter audio specs; adding Chromecast restores network streaming parity [4][5].  
**Computation:** 448.99 ÷ 499.95 = **0.898 → 0.9**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product page still hosts a **latest firmware** link, and documented updates (including AirPlay 2 and service fixes) run through **2019–2021** [1][2]. Warranty/RMA data aren’t published and long-term parts/service clarity is limited. Middle-of-the-road → **0.4**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design prioritizes **space efficiency** via Class-D amplification and standard digital processing. It avoids non-scientific add-ons; trade-offs are explainable by engineering constraints rather than myths. Skipping HDMI 2.1/eARC and advanced room EQ limits future-proofing, so overall **average rationality → 0.5**.

## Advice

If you **must have a very slim AVR**, 5.1 channels suffice, and you want built-in streaming, the VSX-S520 remains workable. If you plan for **8K/4K120**, **eARC**, or want better headroom and longevity, the **Denon AVR-S570BT + Chromecast 4K** bundle (total 448.99 USD) is stronger value today [4][5]. Also note the S520’s power figures are at **1 kHz / 1.0% THD**; set expectations accordingly [1].
