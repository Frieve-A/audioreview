## Overview

The Pioneer TS-WX400DA is a compact under-seat powered subwoofer built around a rectangular driver (approx. 9" × 5.5" effective cone, ~8" effective surface area) and a built-in Class-D amplifier rated at 100 W RMS (250 W max). The enclosure measures 300 × 100 × 200 mm (11.75" × 3.79" × 7.79") and includes a wired remote, variable low-pass crossover (50–125 Hz, 12 dB/oct), phase control, and three DSP bass modes (DEEP/NATURAL/DYNAMIC). Line-level and speaker-level inputs support easy integration. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent third-party measurements are scarce. Manufacturer specifications state 100 W RMS output and frequency response **20–100 Hz**, with regional spec sheets clarifying this is referenced at **−20 dB** in both DEEP and DYNAMIC modes. Sensitivity is listed as **72–73 dB (1 W/1 m)** on the U.S. spec tab, while a separate “Speaker Efficiency” note cites **100 dB in-car (2 V input)**—a different context than 1 W/1 m free-field. These are catalog values and should be treated accordingly; size and power imply modest deep-bass headroom typical of slim under-seat designs. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A conventional compact Class-D powered sub with basic onboard DSP (three presets) and a wired remote. Useful integration features (variable LPF, phase, line/speaker-level inputs) are present. There’s no app control or fully parametric EQ. The sealed metal enclosure emphasizes durability and fit in tight spaces. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

**Price basis:** **470 USD** (official U.S. Pioneer online store).  
**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator by rated capability:** **Rockville SS8P** under-seat powered sub at **99.95 USD** with **100 W RMS**, **20–150 Hz** spec, wired remote, and 2.8" height. Ratio: **99.95 ÷ 470 ≈ 0.213 → 0.2** (one-decimal scoring). [1][4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

In the U.S., the standard **limited warranty is 1 year (parts/labor)** when purchased from an authorized dealer, per Pioneer’s Car/Marine warranty. Long-term failure-rate data is not published; no firmware applies. [3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product sensibly targets severe space constraints with a compact, rugged package and simple DSP presets. However, absent advanced tuning and given current list pricing versus equally capable rivals by spec, it prioritizes convenience and brand coverage over outright performance value. [1][4]

## Advice

If you specifically need an under-seat format with straightforward integration and prefer a major brand/dealer network, the TS-WX400DA is clean and easy to install. If budget-to-output is your priority, **Rockville SS8P** offers similar rated capability at a much lower price. For more amplifier headroom in a compact form, consider **Kicker Hideaway HS8** (150 W RMS; 25–120 Hz) or **Alpine PWE-S8** (120 W RMS; 25–152 Hz). Always confirm fit/mounting for your vehicle.
