## Overview

The Yongse A-melody is a 4-core earphone cable featuring proprietary Air-shield technology, priced at 280 USD. The cable combines copper-silver alloy conductors (4% silver content) with pure silver conductors, utilizing what the manufacturer claims is a spiral wire guide structure that creates an air insulation layer for external noise blocking and signal path optimization. Available through crowdfunding with various connector options including 0.78mm 2Pin and MMCX terminations with 4.4mm or 2.5mm balanced plugs, the 120cm cable targets audiophiles seeking sound quality improvements through cable replacement.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

As a cable product, the A-melody falls under the category of products with no scientifically audible impact. At 280 USD, this constitutes a significant price premium over basic cables. The manufacturer claims audible sound quality improvements through Air-shield technology and signal path optimization, but provides no ABX blind test data, third-party measurements, or equivalent scientific evidence of audibility. The spiral wire guide structure and air insulation claims lack objective measurement verification. For high-priced products claiming audible sound quality improvement without scientific evidence, the evaluation criteria specify a Scientific Validity score of 0.0. No measurable electrical characteristics (resistance, capacitance, inductance) are provided that would demonstrate performance differences from standard cables.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The A-melody incorporates proprietary Air-shield technology with a spiral wire guide structure designed to create air insulation layers. This represents original design work with in-house development and manufacturing capabilities. The technology concept appears novel in the cable market, though effectiveness remains unproven. However, the implementation relies purely on analog/mechanical approaches without integration of modern digital technologies, software, or advanced materials science. The 4-core configuration with mixed conductor materials (copper-silver alloy and pure silver) follows conventional high-end cable design principles rather than innovative approaches. While the Air-shield concept demonstrates some technical creativity, the overall technology level remains limited by analog-only implementation and lack of scientific validation of the underlying principles.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

At 280 USD, the A-melody competes against numerous equivalent or superior cables at substantially lower prices. The FAAEAL 4 Core High Purity Copper Cable at 15.99 USD provides equivalent connector options (0.78mm 2Pin, MMCX with 3.5mm/4.4mm/2.5mm), similar length, and proven performance. Equipped with high purity copper conductors and same connector options, and equivalent functionality. CP = 15.99 USD ÷ 280 USD = 0.057, rounded to 0.1. Alternative options include the Yongse Galaxy 8 Core 5N-Pure Silver Cable at 69.99 USD, offering superior 8-core configuration and pure silver construction at significantly lower cost. The extreme price premium cannot be justified by any measurable performance advantages over budget alternatives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The A-melody offers standard 1-year manufacturer warranty with customer support available through dealer networks. Cable construction utilizes simple 4-core design with minimal moving parts, contributing to inherent reliability advantages. The manufacturer provides repair and replacement services for defects within the warranty period. However, the 1-year warranty period falls below the typical 2-year standard for audio equipment. Support infrastructure relies primarily on dealer-based assistance rather than direct manufacturer support systems. No special support features, extended warranty options, or enhanced repair services are provided. The simple cable construction reduces potential failure points, but warranty coverage and support duration remain at basic industry levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The design philosophy emphasizes subjective sound quality improvements through unproven Air-shield technology without scientific validation. Claims of audible effects through air insulation and spiral wire guide structures contradict established cable science, where properly designed cables within specification ranges produce no audible differences. The approach represents typical high-end cable marketing focused on unverifiable performance claims rather than measurable improvements. Cost allocation toward proprietary mechanical structures lacks justification when equivalent functionality is achievable through standard cable designs at substantially lower cost. The philosophy promotes audio-specific equipment pricing without scientific basis for audio applications requiring specialized cables beyond basic electrical specifications. Innovation claims lack empirical foundation, representing conservative analog approaches rather than advancement in cable technology or materials science.

## Advice

Potential purchasers should carefully consider the lack of scientific evidence supporting audible improvements from the A-melody's Air-shield technology and extreme cost-performance disadvantage. Standard 4-core cables with equivalent specifications are available at under 20 USD, providing identical functionality without premium pricing. For users requiring balanced connectivity and quality construction, established alternatives like the FAAEAL High Purity Copper Cable or Yongse Galaxy Pure Silver options deliver equivalent or superior specifications at fraction of the cost. The 280 USD price point cannot be justified through measurable performance advantages. Users seeking genuine audio improvements should prioritize upgrades to source components, amplifiers, or transducers where measurable differences exist, rather than cables where audible improvements remain scientifically unverified.
