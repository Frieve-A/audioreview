summary: "ZERO LINK–only network transport. Currently the least-expensive path into ZERO LINK, but no third-party measurements and a narrow ecosystem limit broader appeal."

## Overview

Sforzato’s DST-Lynx is a Japanese network transport that accepts LAN/USB and outputs **only** via the proprietary ZERO LINK interface co-defined by Sforzato and SOULNOTE [4]. Market price in Japan is **858,000円** tax-in (≈ **5,700 USD** by conversion) with catalog support up to **PCM 768 kHz/32-bit** and **DSD512** [1][5]. Recent software activity (e.g., TIDAL Max enablement for DST/DSP series) indicates ongoing support [3]. The product targets owners of ZERO LINK DACs rather than general USB/SPDIF systems.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are **no** independent third-party measurements (e.g., ABX, jitter at DAC output, SINAD) of DST-Lynx. Manufacturer/dealer materials claim bit-perfect transport with formats up to **PCM 768 kHz/32-bit** and **DSD512** [1][5]. ZERO LINK’s premise is to slave the transport to the DAC’s master clock to eliminate asynchronous stages [4], but absent controlled evidence of audible improvements over modern, transparent USB chains, we assign a provisional mid-score pending measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Beyond the distinctive clock-mastered **ZERO LINK** concept [4], the overall architecture (network input, digital format handling) is typical of streamer transports [5]. With limited ecosystem adoption, no peer-reviewed papers or patents cited, and no comparative measured advantages published, the technology score remains low.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Equivalence definition:** Because DST-Lynx offers **ZERO LINK output only**, valid comparators must also provide **ZERO LINK output**. As of this review, the only widely available alternative is the **SOULNOTE Z-3**, whose current Japan market price is **1,019,700円–1,049,400円**—**higher** than DST-Lynx at **858,000円** [6]. No cheaper single-box or minimal-bundle solution achieves ZERO LINK output.  
→ By policy, when no cheaper equivalent-or-better option exists, **CP = 1.0**.

*(Context for non-ZERO LINK systems: mainstream USB transports such as **Aurender N150** (3,500 USD; USB up to 384 kHz/DSD512 native) [7] and **LUMIN U2 Mini** (2,880 USD; supports DSD512/PCM768 via USB) [8] are much cheaper, but they **lack ZERO LINK** and thus are **not valid CP comparators** here.)*

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Sforzato is a small maker with limited global service footprint. Positively, the firm has shipped functional updates (e.g., TIDAL Max enablement) and maintains control software support for current models [3]. Long-term fleet reliability data and international service logistics remain sparse, so the score sits slightly below average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Centering a proprietary, DAC-dependent link narrows usability and demands matched DACs and cabling. Without third-party evidence of audible superiority over proven, transparent USB implementations, the direction appears misaligned with broad, measurable listener benefit. For most systems, equally transparent results are achievable with standard interfaces at far lower cost (see Advice).

## Advice

- **Own a ZERO LINK DAC?** If you need a **new** ZERO LINK transport at the **lowest current price**, DST-Lynx is that entry point in Japan [1][6].  
- **Do not own a ZERO LINK DAC?** You will generally achieve transparent playback more affordably and flexibly with transports like **Aurender N150** (USB; PCM up to 384 kHz, DSD512 native) [7] or **LUMIN U2 Mini** (USB; PCM up to 768 kHz, DSD512) [8].  
- **Focus on software/ecosystem** (control apps, library handling) and required I/O. Reserve budget for the DAC and speakers where measurable differences are larger.
