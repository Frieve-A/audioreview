## Overview

The Truthear Nova is a hybrid in-ear monitor with a 1DD+4BA array and 3-way crossover, released in 2023 at 149 USD. It targets users seeking a Harman-style balance with a conventional hybrid implementation. Official specs include sensitivity 123 dB/Vrms @1 kHz, THD≤1% @1 kHz (94 dB), effective FR 20 Hz–20 kHz (IEC60318-4, −3 dB), and impedance 14.8 Ω. Third-party FR measurements confirm a Harman-leaning response. [1][2][3][4][5]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent FR data places Nova close to Harman IE 2019 through the mids with modest upper-treble energy above 10 kHz depending on tips/rig, consistent with a neutral-with-bass-shelf presentation. Manufacturer specs show low distortion (THD≤1% @1 kHz, 94 dB) and high sensitivity (123 dB/Vrms), and effective FR 20–20 kHz (−3 dB). Impedance is 14.8 Ω, supporting easy drive from common sources. While not uniformly “transparent” across all headphone criteria, measured FR/THD place Nova near the transparency borderline for IEMs. [1][2][3][4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Nova uses a standard hybrid recipe—PU+LCP 10 mm DD plus 4 BAs with acoustic waveguides and RC crossover in a 3D-printed resin shell. Execution is competent but not notably novel versus peers; there is no evidence of proprietary acoustic breakthroughs or unusual integration beyond current best practice. [2][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better):** *Truthear x Crinacle ZERO:RED* at **54.99 USD**. Rationale: wired IEM with Harman-aligned tuning validated on B&K 5128, with low-distortion DD drivers—user-visible functions and measured FR adherence are equivalent for neutrality-focused use.  
**Calculation:** 54.99 ÷ 149 = **0.37** → rounded to **0.4**.  
Nova’s price is therefore meaningfully higher than a functionally equivalent Harman-style option. [1][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Warranty coverage is **1 year**, typical for this segment but below the 2-year baseline some brands provide. Truthear maintains online support/contact and retailer-backed warranty handling. Construction is simple (no active electronics), which helps, but the short formal warranty and limited long-term track record keep this at an average score. [6][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A measurement-first Harman implementation is scientifically rational, and the design avoids occult claims. However, the approach is conservative—largely refining known solutions rather than expanding measurable performance or price efficiency relative to cheaper Harman-tuned sets. [1][2][5]

## Advice

Nova suits listeners who want a neutral-ish, measurement-aligned IEM with a conventional hybrid build and comfortable sensitivity. If you value maximum price efficiency for a Harman sound, evaluate *Truthear x Crinacle ZERO:RED* first given its similar measured tonality at a substantially lower price; Nova makes sense if you prefer its fit, accessories, or specific tonality refinements and are comfortable with the premium. [1][5]
