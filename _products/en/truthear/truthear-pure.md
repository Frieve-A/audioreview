## Overview

The TRUTHEAR Pure is a hybrid IEM with a 1DD+3BA configuration, announced as the successor to the company's popular Hexa model [1]. Priced at 89.99 USD, it features a 10mm dynamic driver and three balanced armature drivers. With its DLP-3D printed medical-grade high-transparency resin housing and precisely designed crossover system, the product aims to solve phase characteristic issues that conventional multi-driver IEMs suffer from. It addresses issues identified in the Hexa through objective measurement data-based improvements, achieving more natural tonality and balanced sound quality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Limited comprehensive third-party measurement data restricts assessment confidence. THD estimated below 0.1% at 1kHz/94dB SPL approaches the excellent threshold (0.05%) for headphones/earphones but lacks verification from major test laboratories [2]. Frequency response shows effective range of 20Hz-20kHz with 3-4dB elevation in bass to midrange, within standard deviation tolerance (±3dB). Passive isolation measured at approximately 80% translates to 15-20dB blocking, between excellent (30dB+) and problematic (10dB-) thresholds. Phase characteristic optimization across the 4-driver configuration shows measurable improvements, though comprehensive SINAD and detailed distortion curves remain unavailable from ASR/RTINGS/Erin's Audio Corner sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Excellent technical implementation can be evaluated for the mid-level price range. The 10mm dynamic driver adopts a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) diaphragm, achieving accurate low-frequency reproduction. For integration with the three balanced armature drivers, it employs frequency crossovers, building a system where each driver plays an appropriate role. The DLP-3D printed housing manufacturing uses medical-grade resin, achieving precision molding through HeyGear technology [3]. Including the newly designed copper-silver plated coaxial cable, it represents technically sophisticated implementation for this price range, showing a technology level above industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

More affordable alternatives with equivalent functionality exist. Against the Pure (89.99 USD), the Truthear Gate (17 USD) demonstrates equivalent-or-better performance [4]. Gate shows THD performance described as "basically distortionless" by ASR (vs Pure's estimated <0.1%) and frequency response deviation "naturally very small" (vs Pure's 3-4dB elevation), demonstrating better measured performance. The calculation formula is CP = 17 USD / 89.99 USD = 0.2. This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Gate provides equivalent IEM functionality with 0.78mm 2-pin connector and passive isolation at approximately 19% of Pure's price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Below average reliability and support structure. The 1-year warranty period covers manufacturing defects only, shorter than industry standards [1]. DLP-3D printed housing achieves reasonable durability with medical-grade resin, though coating durability concerns exist on metal components. Regional support variations limit global coverage, with some authorized retailers not authorized for warranty claims outside specific regions. Repair services available through official program with 7-working-day processing, but discontinued model replacement policies and limited extended warranty options reduce overall support confidence.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

It adopts an extremely rational design approach. Design optimization based on scientific measurements is a typical example of empirical sound quality improvement [5]. In improvements from Hexa, the methodology of systematically improving each component using feedback and measurement data is highly commendable. As demonstrated by the collaboration track record with Crinacle, it adopts an objective tuning approach based on measurements and maintains a design philosophy that does not depend on subjective evaluation. It makes rational design decisions with measurable effects, such as phase characteristic optimization in multi-driver configurations and tuning based on Harman targets. The corporate attitude of completely excluding occult elements and conducting continuous improvements based on objective data is extremely rational.

## Advice

The TRUTHEAR Pure can be evaluated as a product that achieves actual sound quality improvements through scientifically-based design improvements. Particularly as Hexa's successor, the optimization of phase characteristics in multi-driver configurations and improvements in sound quality balance are noteworthy. However, from a cost-performance perspective, since the Truthear Gate provides equivalent measured performance at 17 USD, it is difficult to recommend for users who prioritize pure functionality-to-price ratio. Users who should choose Pure are limited to those who can find value in the sound quality sophistication and technical completeness of the 4-driver configuration and can tolerate the significant price premium. For first-time IEM purchasers, we recommend first confirming basic performance with Gate and considering upgrading to Pure when seeking higher-dimensional sound quality. While technical completeness is certainly high, the substantial cost increase over equivalent-performing alternatives limits its appeal.
