summary: "The Truthear Hexa is a Chinese IEM offering a 1DD+3BA hybrid configuration at USD 79.99. While its measured performance is solid, it faces serious price competitiveness issues, as competitors like the CCA C10 offer a 1DD+4BA configuration for around USD 25. Although praised for excellent isolation and a flat frequency response, its cost-performance ratio significantly lags behind alternatives."

## Overview

The Truthear Hexa is a hybrid IEM released in 2023, featuring a 1DD+3BA driver configuration. It combines a 10mm PU+LCP composite diaphragm dynamic driver with three balanced armature drivers, offered at USD 79.99. Reflecting the company's measurement-driven approach, the tuning is based on the Harman target curve.

The design incorporates 3D-printed PU+LCP composite diaphragm, N52 magnet system, and phase coherence technology, achieving a warm-neutral sound signature. RTINGS measurements confirm excellent isolation performance and flat frequency response characteristics.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Scientific validity based on measurement data is highly rated. Specifications of THD≤1%@1kHz (94dB), sensitivity 120dB/Vrms@1kHz, and impedance 20.5Ω±15%@1kHz are objectively good. RTINGS' 2025 measurements confirm excellent isolation performance (10dB physical isolation with foam tips) and flat frequency response. The measurement graphs are also included in Crinacle's database, showing good characteristics across the 20Hz-20kHz range. Phase coherence technology ensures phase alignment across all frequency bands.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Technical competence is solid but lacks uniqueness. The combination of 10mm PU+LCP composite diaphragm dynamic driver and three BA drivers is technically sound, with appropriate use of N52 magnets and dual-cavity internal magnetic circuits. The combination of 3D DLP-printed medical-grade resin shells and CNC-machined aluminum faceplates ensures quality standards. However, these technical elements are combinations of existing technologies, with no innovative breakthroughs evident.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Cost-performance is a significant issue. While the Truthear Hexa (USD 79.99) features a 1DD+3BA configuration, the CCA C10 achieves a 1DD+4BA setup with more drivers for around USD 25. Based purely on a comparison of driver count and price, the Hexa's cost-performance must be rated as extremely low. The CP equation is CP = USD 25 ÷ USD 79.99 ≒ 0.31. The CCA C10 delivers excellent sound in its price range, raising serious questions about the rationality of the Hexa's pricing. Other affordable options like the KZ ZSN Pro X (approx. USD 25, 1DD+1BA) also exist, completely eroding the Hexa's price advantage.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Regarding reliability, while general sound quality and fit receive positive reviews, some users have reported concerns about build quality. For instance, there are isolated issues mentioned regarding the faceplate finish and the durability of the cable connection points. Since Truthear is a relatively new company (established in 2022), the long-term support system and continuity of after-sales service are currently unknown variables.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Design philosophy is highly rational. Adherence to Harman target curve, measurement-based tuning, and acoustic design using phase coherence technology are all scientifically grounded. Technical approaches including 3D DLP-printed acoustic waveguide optimization, medical-grade resin use, and acoustic waveguide design with filtering functions are consistently rational. The design philosophy prioritizing objective measurement data over subjective "musicality" is also commendable.

## Advice

The Truthear Hexa is a technically excellent IEM but faces serious challenges in cost-performance. With products like the CCA C10 (approx. USD 25) offering more drivers at a lower price, the Hexa currently has no price advantage.

**Recommended for**:
- Those who are strongly attracted to the Truthear brand and design.
- Those with an USD 80 budget seeking flat sound quality compliant with the Harman target.
- Those who appreciate a sound design based on measurement data.

**Should consider alternatives**:
- Those prioritizing cost-performance (CCA C10 or KZ ZSN Pro X recommended).
- Those who emphasize long-term product reliability and support.

At its current pricing, products with potentially equivalent or superior performance are available for less than a third of the cost, making a purchase of the Hexa something that requires careful consideration. However, for those who find value in Truthear's tuning philosophy, it may still be an option.
