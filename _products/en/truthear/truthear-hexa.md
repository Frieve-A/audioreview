## Overview

The HEXA represents TRUTHEAR's first independent hybrid IEM following their collaborative models, combining 1DD+3BA drivers in a DLP 3D-printed housing. Released in 2022 at 89.99 USD, it targets the budget-conscious audiophile segment with measurement-based tuning aimed at Harman target compliance. The product showcases the company's transition from collaboration-dependent releases to in-house engineering capabilities within their first year of operation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The HEXA has been independently measured by multiple credible third-party sources including RTINGS, SoundGuys, and Crinacle. SoundGuys measurements demonstrate exceptional passive isolation of 44-54dB above 5kHz [2], far exceeding the 30dB excellent threshold for IEMs. Frequency response closely follows the Harman target curve with approximately ±3dB deviation, primarily from slightly elevated treble energy [2], placing adherence at standard level. RTINGS independently confirms flat frequency response characteristics and exceptionally low distortion [3]. Manufacturer THD specification of ≤1% at 1kHz (94dB) represents rated output level [1]; independent third-party measurements consistently confirm distortion performance well below problematic thresholds at typical listening levels [2][3]. Two of three key indicators (isolation, distortion) clear transparent level, while frequency response adherence remains at standard level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The HEXA demonstrates in-house design capabilities with cutting-edge DLP 3D printing manufacturing partnership through HeyGears, enabling complex acoustic waveguide structures impossible with traditional injection molding methods. This manufacturing technology represents advanced capabilities that competitors actively seek to access for their own products. The acoustic implementation includes proprietary waveguide design with RC filtering function for frequency division precision. However, the product fundamentally relies on established audio technologies including standard hybrid driver configurations, common PU+LCP diaphragm materials, and conventional balanced armature implementations from the 2010s era, limiting technological advancement beyond manufacturing innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

The HEXA is currently available at 89.99 USD [1]. The TRUTHEAR x Crinacle Zero:Red at 64.99 USD [6] provides equivalent-or-better measured performance. Equipped with equivalent connectivity (0.78mm 2-pin detachable cable, 3.5mm wired) and passive isolation capabilities, the Zero:Red demonstrates comparable frequency response adherence to the Harman target curve and comparable distortion performance (both with manufacturer THD <1% at 1kHz), confirmed by independent RTINGS measurements for both products with no significant performance disparity identified [3][4]. Both products provide equivalent passive noise isolation functionality with no active processing.

CP = 64.99 USD ÷ 89.99 USD = 0.72

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Global manufacturer support system provides centralized repair program with one-year warranty coverage from date of invoice, though some retailers extend coverage to two years. Known product issues include faceplate screw corrosion affecting metal components and cable quality concerns with reported microphonic behavior. Isolated reports document connection point durability problems and build quality variations in faceplate finish. However, the moderate design complexity with 4-driver hybrid configuration includes robust construction elements, and the company has established adequate support infrastructure with repair programs and customer service systems. The DLP 3D printing manufacturing process contributes to consistent build quality and precision assembly standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

TRUTHEAR demonstrates rational measurement-focused development approach with scientific target curve adherence using BK5128 HATS validation methodology and objective measurement prioritization over subjective preferences. Manufacturing costs directly contribute to acoustic performance improvements through specialized driver selection and DLP 3D printing precision rather than aesthetic enhancement or brand positioning. The subsequent Pure model release shows measurable frequency response improvements over HEXA, indicating progressive development methodology with performance-based iteration. The company's collaboration with measurement-focused reviewers demonstrates commitment to scientific validation over marketing-driven claims. Advanced manufacturing integration through DLP 3D printing represents innovative approach to achieving precision acoustic structures, though reliance on established acoustic technologies limits proprietary advancement.

## Advice

The HEXA serves buyers prioritizing exceptional passive isolation performance and scientifically-tuned frequency response in the sub-100 USD market segment. The measurement-focused tuning approach with Harman target adherence appeals specifically to users prioritizing objective audio reproduction over subjective tonal preferences. Build quality demonstrates adequate standards with DLP 3D printing precision, though potential purchasers should consider documented issues including screw corrosion and cable quality limitations. The cost-performance analysis indicates superior alternatives exist within the same manufacturer's product line, suggesting evaluation of the Zero:Red model for equivalent performance at reduced cost while maintaining similar acoustic characteristics and build quality standards.
