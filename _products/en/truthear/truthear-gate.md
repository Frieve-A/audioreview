summary: "The Truthear Gate is an ultra-budget IEM featuring a 10mm dynamic driver with a Carbon LCP/PU diaphragm. Official specs state THD≤1% @1kHz (94dB) and 122dB/Vrms sensitivity, with manufacturer-claimed nonlinear distortion <0.2% at 104dB SPL. Third-party 5128 measurements indicate competent tuning for the class. At USD 21.99, its closest cheaper equivalent is the Tangzu Wan’er SG (USD 19.80)."

## Overview

The Truthear Gate is a 2024 ultra-budget IEM positioned as a successor to the discontinued Hola. It uses a 10mm dynamic driver with a Carbon LCP dome + ultra-thin PU diaphragm in a PC+ABS shell and a 0.78mm recessed 2-pin cable. Truthear emphasizes a measurement-led tuning with a light V-shaped balance. Official specs list 28Ω impedance and 122dB/Vrms sensitivity, with THD≤1% @1kHz (94dB). Truthear also claims <0.2% nonlinear distortion at 104dB SPL. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Objective data supports solid, if not class-leading, fidelity. Manufacturer specs report THD≤1% @1kHz (94dB) and <0.2% nonlinear distortion at 104dB SPL (manufacturer claim) alongside an effective 20Hz–20kHz band (IEC60318-4, −3dB). [1] Third-party B&K 5128 measurements show Gate tracks contemporary DF/HRTF targets reasonably well for a single-DD budget set, with no obvious gross response errors noted in the review. [2] Absent independent distortion data, we provisionally weight THD claims conservatively; combined with generally competent FR behavior, a 0.7 (“transparent-borderline”) score is warranted. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The design—10mm single dynamic with Carbon-LCP/PU diaphragm, N52 magnet double-cavity motor, and molded PC+ABS enclosure—is a mature, industry-standard recipe without unique patents or novel architectures at this price. Execution appears careful but not innovative relative to peers. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Market price at review: **USD 21.99** (official store). [1]  
Cheapest equivalent-or-better option identified: **Tangzu Wan’er SG, USD 19.80** (Amazon US, current listing). It offers the same core user functions (single dynamic driver, detachable 0.78mm 2-pin cable) and comparable measured FR to widely used targets; thus judged equivalent from a user-facing performance perspective. [3][4]  
**CP calculation:** 19.80 ÷ 21.99 = **0.90** → rounds to **0.9**. [3][4][1]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Build uses a lightweight PC+ABS shell and a standard recessed 2-pin interface for easy cable replacement. Truthear provides product support pages; major authorized retailers list warranty coverage (e.g., two-year warranty via Shenzhenaudio for Truthear IEMs). Long-term failure statistics are still limited for this specific model, but infrastructure and parts availability appear adequate for the segment. [1][5]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Emphasis on objective tuning and published specs is rational. Independent 5128 FR data suggests Gate is aligned with modern targets for neutral listening with light bass lift. However, with numerous near-equivalent single-DD competitors at similar or lower prices, the design choices do not significantly advance audibility beyond established norms. [1][2][3]

## Advice

Gate delivers competent, measurement-aligned sound for a very low price, with a transparent housing and standard 2-pin convenience. It’s an easy recommendation if you prefer Truthear’s presentation and want a simple, reliable single-DD set.

**Consider also:**  
- **Tangzu Wan’er SG (USD 19.80)** — equal core functions and comparable FR at a slightly lower price. [3][4]  
- **Moondrop Chu II (often ~USD 19–23)** — another single-DD alternative with widely published FR data; choose based on preferred FR shape and fit. [6]
