summary: "Japanese high-end monaural power amplifier released in 1985. The design intent is distinctive for its time, but no public measurement data exists; against today’s measurement-disclosed landscape, superiority cannot be substantiated."

## Overview

The Linear Technology M-151 is a Japanese monaural power amplifier released in 1985. Designed as a single-channel derivation of the M-152 stereo amplifier, it was sold at a list price of 6040 USD (pair). Contemporary materials mention design choices such as storage-time tuning and the use of mercury contact muting relays to minimize audible artifacts. However, publicly verifiable measurement data (e.g., THD+N, SNR, output impedance, frequency response with levels) is not available, which limits scientific comparison.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

No primary, public measurement dataset (THD+N, SNR, output impedance, level-referenced bandwidth, etc.) was located. Per policy, the score starts at 0.5 when performance is unknown. Absent third-party measurements or official disclosure, no further adjustment is made.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Monoblock architecture and component selection aimed at minimizing noise/interference are rational in context. Today, compact high‑efficiency architectures and rigorously measured feedback designs are widely available; without disclosed measurements, technical advantage cannot be established. Mercury contact relays are also problematic under modern environmental and serviceability considerations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Concrete comparison (policy CP):
- Fosi Audio V3 Mono (Class D monoblock, 240W/4Ω, published specs: THD < 0.006%, SNR ≥ 123dB, XLR/RCA I/O): lowest prices confirmed around 164 USD each [1, 2].

Pairwise calculation and CP value:
- Comparator pair price = 164 × 2 = 328 USD
- Subject list price (pair) = 6040 USD
- CP (policy) = 328 ÷ 6040 ≈ 0.054 → score 0.1 (rounded to 0.1 increments)

With no disclosed measurements or support for the M‑151, similarly capable, measurement‑disclosed modern options at a tiny fraction of price undermine its practical value proposition.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Linear Technology (Japan) is defunct; official support cannot be expected. Age‑related component risks and sourcing difficulty are material, and specialized parts can be challenging to replace under modern regulations. Long‑term use presumes third‑party maintenance.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Within the constraints of its era, reducing interference via monaural implementation is sensible. Today’s norms emphasize measurement disclosure, environmental responsibility, and serviceability; limited disclosure is a significant drawback. Relative to modern transparency‑focused designs, rationality is constrained.

## Advice

Not recommended for practical, measurement‑driven use. Lack of disclosed performance and absence of manufacturer support make modern, measurement‑disclosed monoblocks/stereo amps with warranty the rational choice at far lower prices. Consider the M‑151 primarily for collection value or affinity with its historical design intent.
