summary: "Premium open-back planar magnetic headphones with superb build and comfort; measured performance is clean but not neutral, and cost-performance is very poor versus cheaper models that match or exceed measurement-based sound quality."

## Overview

The Meze Audio Empyrean is a flagship open-back planar magnetic headphone using a hybrid array driver developed with Rinaro. It launched at 2,999 USD with an aluminum chassis and leather headband. The original Empyrean is now discontinued and replaced by the Empyrean II, but it remains notable for luxurious build and a warm, relaxed tuning.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent lab data shows **low distortion** and **excellent bass extension**, but a **bass-heavy/treble-light balance** that falls short of transparency. Hi-Fi News measured *LF extension <20 Hz (–6 dB ref. 200 Hz) and THD <0.1% at 100 Hz/1 kHz for 90 dB SPL*, sensitivity **109.3 dB SPL @ 1 V**, and near-flat response below 1 kHz, while noting under-emphasis around 2–3 kHz and treble lightness [1]. RTINGS measurements corroborate the tonal tilt and list low-frequency extension at **~60 Hz** on their rig and elevated bass with under-emphasized upper treble [2].  
Manufacturer specifications for the original model list **frequency response 4–110,000 Hz**, **nominal SPL 100 dB (1 mW/1 kHz)**, and **THD <0.1%**, which align broadly with third-party measurements but do not contradict the observed treble roll-off [3][4]. Overall, distortion and extension are strong, but frequency-response neutrality (the main determinant of audible accuracy) is not at a transparent level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Empyrean’s Rinaro **Isodynamic Hybrid Array®** (large ovoid planar) and magnetically attached pads are thoughtful engineering, executed in a robust CNC-milled aluminum chassis. While refined and distinctive, these are evolutionary rather than disruptive advances in planar headphone design [3].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

We compare against the **cheapest product with equivalent or better user-facing functions and measured performance** (open-back wired over-ear for home listening; FR accuracy and THD as primary metrics). The **Sennheiser HD 560S** qualifies: it is open-back, measures very neutrally (**RMS deviation midrange 0.93 dB; treble RMS 2.33 dB**) with **outstanding THD (0.05% @ 94 dB; 0.21% @ 104 dB)**, and thus meets or exceeds Empyrean in measurement-based accuracy [5]. Current new-unit street price observed at **268 USD** [6].  
**CP = 268 ÷ 2,999 = 0.089 → 0.1**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Meze provides a **2-year manufacturer warranty** on top models including Empyrean-class products [7][8]. Build is extremely solid (metal chassis, serviceable design), and Meze emphasizes **modular, fully serviceable construction** for longevity [9]. No firmware/software applies. Long-term failure data is limited, but the physical design and after-sales framework are strong for a passive headphone.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design prioritizes comfort, materials, and a pleasing, warm sound over strict neutrality. That is rational for listeners who value long-session comfort and luxurious build, but it does not push toward transparent FR targets that maximize scientific fidelity. Subsequent Empyrean II tuning trends more neutral, suggesting incremental alignment with measurement-driven goals.

## Advice

Choose Empyrean if you want top-tier comfort and craftsmanship with a relaxed, warm presentation and you value materials/finish as much as measurable neutrality. If you prioritize **objective accuracy per measurements**, the **HD 560S** achieves similar (or better) results at a fraction of the price, and many mid-priced open-backs (e.g., HIFIMAN Edition XS) also exceed Empyrean’s neutrality.
