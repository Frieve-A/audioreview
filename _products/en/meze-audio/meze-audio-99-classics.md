## Overview

The Meze Audio 99 Classics represent Romanian manufacturer Meze Audio's approach to premium headphone design, combining traditional craftsmanship with modern acoustic engineering. Founded in 2011 by industrial designer Antonio Meze, the company emphasizes artisanal construction with each walnut wood earcup undergoing a 45-day hand-finishing process. The 99 Classics feature 40mm dynamic drivers with neodymium magnets in a closed-back design, targeting audiophiles seeking both aesthetic appeal and acoustic performance. At 309 USD, these headphones position themselves in the premium segment while maintaining relatively accessible pricing compared to high-end offerings.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third-party measurements from Stereophile reveal that the 99 Classics achieve excellent overall tonality, with measurements placing them "at or very near the top" when compared to other headphones approximating the Harman Target Response curve [1]. Frequency response extends from 15Hz to 25kHz with good linearity [1]. Measured sensitivity reaches 120.0-123.0 dB SPL, significantly exceeding manufacturer specifications and providing excellent efficiency [2]. Distortion performance demonstrates exceptional quality with very low THD above 150Hz throughout the mid-range and treble, with Stereophile noting they "rarely seen a dynamic drive headphone with such low distortion" in these frequencies [1]. Bass distortion rises below 100Hz but remains within acceptable levels for the price category. The measured impedance of 18.5-21 ohms closely matches manufacturer specifications. The combination of excellent frequency response matching professional targets and exceptionally low midrange/treble distortion places the 99 Classics at transparent performance levels despite minor bass distortion.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The 99 Classics employ conventional 40mm dynamic drivers with standard neodymium magnets and Mylar diaphragms, representing mature technology without significant innovation. Construction emphasizes traditional materials through CNC-carved walnut wood earcups and cast zinc alloy hardware with electroplated finishes. While the modular design enables serviceability with replaceable components, the underlying technology lacks modern digital integration or proprietary acoustic innovations. The extensive hand-finishing process demonstrates craftsmanship but does not contribute to technical advancement. Manufacturing approaches remain fundamentally analog and mechanical without incorporation of DSP, active components, or computational audio technologies that characterize contemporary high-performance headphones.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Audio-Technica ATH-M40x at 99 USD provides equivalent-or-better user-facing functionality with 40mm dynamic drivers, closed-back design, and professional studio monitoring specifications [3]. Equipped with neodymium magnets and frequency response of 15Hz-24kHz, the ATH-M40x delivers professional studio monitoring performance with measured sensitivity of 114.0 dB SPL and impedance of 38.5 ohms [4]. Both products provide equivalent closed-back isolation suitable for critical listening applications, with the ATH-M40x featuring similar driver technology and professional-grade construction. The Audio-Technica model offers detachable cables and maintains industry-standard monitoring accuracy used in professional studios worldwide. While the 99 Classics provide superior aesthetic appeal and enhanced serviceability through modular design, the fundamental acoustic performance and user-facing functionality remain equivalent, resulting in a moderate cost-performance ratio reflecting the premium material investments.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Meze Audio provides 1-year warranty for US customers and 2-year warranty for EU customers, below industry average for premium products [5]. However, the 99 Classics feature exceptional serviceability through modular construction assembled with nuts and bolts, enabling replacement of earcups, headband, cables, and drivers. The solid wood and metal construction provides inherent durability with no plastic components that typically degrade over time. Global support infrastructure operates from Romania with direct manufacturer backing for warranty claims. The fully serviceable design philosophy extends product lifespan significantly beyond typical consumer headphones, though limited warranty period reduces initial confidence compared to premium competitors offering extended coverage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Meze Audio's design philosophy emphasizes "Timeless, original, purposeful" aesthetics while maintaining strong commitment to comprehensive quality without compromise [6]. The company incorporates seven core values represented in their symbolic knot: "TIME, MINDFULNESS, BALANCE, MAGIC, HERITAGE, RESPECT, ART" demonstrating a holistic approach to product development [6]. The 45-day walnut finishing process and modular serviceability represent rational long-term thinking that extends product lifespan significantly beyond typical consumer electronics. The company's integral approach ensures that engineering, materials selection, craftsmanship precision, and reliability receive equal importance in the development process [6]. While heritage preservation and artistry constitute significant cost factors, the emphasis on serviceability and longevity demonstrates rational sustainability thinking. The combination of traditional craftsmanship with modern acoustic engineering creates products that balance cultural heritage preservation with functional performance, representing a comprehensive design philosophy that addresses both emotional and technical user needs.

## Advice

The 99 Classics suit buyers prioritizing aesthetic appeal, craftsmanship, and excellent measured acoustic performance in a premium package. The excellent frequency response matching professional targets and exceptionally low distortion justify consideration for users seeking both distinctive styling and transparent sound quality. Budget-conscious audiophiles should examine alternatives like the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x that deliver equivalent functional performance at significantly lower cost. The modular design benefits users planning long-term ownership with periodic component replacement. Consider these headphones for buyers who value both acoustic excellence and artisanal construction, understanding that the premium pricing reflects substantial investment in materials, craftsmanship, and serviceability rather than purely acoustic advancement.
