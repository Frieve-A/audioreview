## Overview

The Meze Audio Empyrean II is the second-generation flagship from Romanian manufacturer Meze Audio, developed with Ukrainian driver specialist Rinaro Isodynamics. It uses the refined MZ3 Isodynamic Hybrid Array driver with dual-shaped voice coils and an ovoid 102×73 mm diaphragm offering 4,650 mm² active area. The system is modular with two interchangeable earpads (Duo and Angled Alcantara) that alter tuning.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specs state total harmonic distortion (THD) **<0.05%** across the whole band, frequency response **8–110,000 Hz**, nominal impedance **32 Ω**, and sensitivity **90 dB SPL / mW (≈ 105 dB SPL @ 1 V, 1 kHz)** [1]. Independent B&K 5128 measurements (Headphones.com forum) show pad-dependent frequency-response behavior: **hybrid (leather/Alcantara)** pads add upper-bass thickness and show a ~6 kHz peak, while **suede/Alcantara** reduces the bass lift and yields a brighter presentation [3]. These data indicate low distortion and competent planar-magnetic behavior, but the FR is not fully “target-neutral,” hence **0.7**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The MZ3 Isodynamic Hybrid Array combines **switchback** and **spiral** voice coils on the same diaphragm to target ear-canal acoustics more effectively (e.g., placing the spiral coil over the canal to increase direct high-frequency energy) [2]. The 0.16 g diaphragm and 4,650 mm² active area, magnet array, and **Isomagnetic** pad coupling reflect mature engineering beyond typical planar designs. Strong innovation, but evolutionary rather than revolutionary, so **0.8**.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Current street price for Empyrean II: **3000 USD** [1,6].  
Cheapest **equal-or-better** alternative identified: **HiFiMAN HE1000SE** at **1699 USD** (direct store and authorized dealers) [5,7,15]. It is an open-back planar with comparable user-facing functions and independent FR datasets on IEC60318-4/GRAS rigs indicating **at least as linear** a response as Empyrean II; third-party reports also show **very low THD** typical of HIFIMAN’s egg-shaped planars [8,9].  
**Calculation:** 1699 USD ÷ 3000 USD = **0.57** → **0.6** (rounded to one decimal).

_Equivalence note:_ open-back planar magnetic; FR linearity equal-or-better (independent graphs), low distortion on both; no essential function deficit vs Empyrean II.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Meze provides a **2-year worldwide warranty** for Empyrean II [10]. The headphone ships with a **high-strength ABS** carry case, two pad sets, and a braided cable [11]. The magnetic pad system and dual mini-XLR connectors aid long-term serviceability. Build quality and parts support are strong; therefore **0.8**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The dual-coil array and pad system are rational, measurement-driven ideas. However, the **110 kHz** extension is non-audible, and pricing prioritizes luxury finishing as much as measurable transparency. Given alternatives with equal-or-better measured fidelity at a much lower price, we assign **0.6**.

## Advice

Empyrean II suits buyers valuing design, build, and pad-based tuning flexibility with very low distortion. If your priority is **maximum measured fidelity per dollar**, the HE1000SE delivers equivalent or better technical results for considerably less, and is the reference CP alternative to shortlist. If you prefer Meze’s ergonomics/industrial design and are comfortable with the premium, Empyrean II remains a refined, low-distortion listen.
