## Overview

The Meze Audio Alba is the Romanian company’s most accessible IEM at 159 USD. It uses a single 10.8 mm dynamic driver in a zinc-alloy + anodized-aluminum shell, ships with a 2-pin detachable cable, four sizes of silicone tips, a carry case, and a custom 3.5 mm-to-USB-C adapter with a built-in DAC/amp for modern device compatibility. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Independent lab data show strong objective performance. RTINGS measures **RMS deviation from target of 2.1 dB** with excellent bass/mid/treble target compliance and **outstanding harmonic distortion (0.04% @94 dB SPL, 0.09% @104 dB SPL)**; low-frequency extension reaches **20 Hz**. Their measurements also confirm near-identical response via the included USB-C dongle. [2] Sensitivity/impedance around **109 dB (1 Vrms) / 32 Ω** are documented in professional testing, supporting easy drivability. [4] Collectively these numbers indicate clean, near-transparent reproduction for an entry-level wired IEM.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Alba relies on a conventional single dynamic driver with undisclosed diaphragm/magnet details and a standard 0.78 mm 2-pin interface. The metal shell and basic venting are well-executed but not innovative relative to current state-of-the-art driver or acoustic tech. [4]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

We compare across classes by **functions + measured performance**. A not-worse alternative is **MOONDROP Kadenz**: includes a balanced **USB-C DAC cable (ECHO-B)** and 3.5 mm adapter in box [7][8], and specifies **THD ≤ 0.03% @1 kHz, 94 dB** with a similar single-DD architecture. Current official pricing is **219.99 USD**. [6][7]  
**CP ratio = 219.99 USD ÷ 159 USD = 1.383… ⇒ bracket 1.0.**  
Alba therefore offers top-tier cost-performance in today’s market.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Warranty:** Alba carries **2 years (EU)** and **1 year (non-EU)** coverage; accessories 6 months. [3] **Service time cap:** repairs/replacements must be completed within a **reasonable period not exceeding 15 calendar days**. [5] Construction (zinc alloy + anodized aluminum) and a simple single-driver layout with a detachable cable support durability. Overall above-average outlook balanced by the standard (not global 2-year) term.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Meze states a philosophy centered on **“creation of beauty”**—prioritizing form, feel, and emotional engagement alongside engineering. [6] This art-first stance is not a rejection of measurements (as results are solid) but it **does** place aesthetic/experiential aims on par with technical optimization, hence a mid-scale score.

## Advice

Alba is a superb entry point if you want **neutral-with-warmth tuning** plus metal build and instant USB-C compatibility in the box. If you value **DSP features and a bundled balanced USB-C DAC** and can spend more, the **MOONDROP Kadenz** is a strong not-worse alternative at a higher price. If you need stronger passive isolation, consider models with foam tips or deeper-insertion shells.
