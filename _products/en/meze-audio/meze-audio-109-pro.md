## Overview

The Meze Audio 109 PRO represents Meze's premium open-back headphone offering at 799 USD, featuring sophisticated materials engineering with 50mm dynamic drivers incorporating beryllium-coated polymer and carbon fiber composite construction. Launched as a demonstration of the company's commitment to emotional sound reproduction, the 109 PRO employs proprietary Dual Membrane Diaphragm technology and handcrafted walnut wood housing. The Romanian manufacturer positions this model as a flagship product combining aesthetic design with acoustic performance, targeting audiophiles seeking premium materials and craftsmanship in open-back headphone design.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Third-party measurements reveal deviations from transparent performance levels. SoundStage measurements show approximately 5% THD at 20Hz, while SoundGuys measured about 1% THD at 100Hz [1], both exceeding the 0.5% problematic threshold for headphones. These elevated distortion measurements occur at extreme low frequencies where headphone performance typically degrades. The manufacturer specification claims less than 0.1% THD at 1kHz [2], but independent measurements contradict these claims across critical frequency ranges. Passive isolation is described as "surprisingly low for a 50mm driver design" [1], though specific numerical values are not provided, preventing comparison against problematic thresholds. Frequency response shows mostly flat performance below 1kHz with typical 3kHz peak, remaining within reasonable deviation bounds. Impedance averages 43 ohms (measured) versus 40 ohm specification [1]. THD performance exceeds problematic thresholds, with discrepancy between claimed and measured values.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 109 PRO demonstrates advanced materials engineering through proprietary Dual Membrane Diaphragm technology combining beryllium-coated semicrystalline polymer applied via Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) with carbon fiber-reinforced cellulose composite construction [2]. The beryllium coating measures 22 microns in thickness, engineered to increase stiffness and durability while maintaining light weight for fast transient response. Complete in-house design includes angled driver mounting for natural sound delivery and spider-shaped acoustically transparent grille structure. Meze employs GRAS 45CA measurement equipment with High Resolution Ear Simulator for development testing [4]. However, the purely analog/mechanical approach lacks digital signal processing, advanced functional integration, or software-based enhancements common in contemporary audio products. The sophisticated materials science represents technology other manufacturers would potentially adopt, demonstrating significant know-how accumulation requiring years for competitors to replicate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The 109 PRO provides open-back listening functionality with detachable cable system and included 1/4-inch adapter at 799 USD. Sennheiser HD 560S offers equivalent open-back functionality with superior measured performance: significantly lower THD (described as "low for open-back dynamic drivers"), superior frequency response neutrality ("nearly flat from bottom to 3kHz"), wider frequency extension (6Hz-38kHz vs 5Hz-30kHz), at 170 USD market price [5]. The HD 560S demonstrates equivalent-or-better user-facing functions and measurably superior acoustic performance across key indicators. CP = 170 USD ÷ 799 USD = 0.213. Additional validation includes Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X at approximately 290 USD, offering neutral tuning with excellent THD performance and equivalent open-back functionality [6]. The substantial price premium for the 109 PRO cannot be justified by measured performance advantages over significantly cheaper alternatives providing superior acoustic specifications.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Meze Audio provides 2-year global warranty coverage with established support infrastructure including dedicated customer service and US repair center (Audio Exchange) [7]. The modular design allows complete disassembly and indefinite serviceability with quality materials including walnut wood, manganese steel, and zinc construction. Manufacturer covers shipping costs both ways for warranty repairs, demonstrating above-average support commitment. However, multiple early unit failures have been documented in Audio Science Review forum, including buzz development and channel failures requiring replacement units [8]. The robust construction design with serviceable components and comprehensive support infrastructure is offset by reported reliability issues in initial production units. Professional repair infrastructure with full warranty coverage on refurbished units provides additional confidence, but documented failure patterns indicate potential quality control concerns requiring monitoring.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Meze Audio employs measurement-based development using professional GRAS 45CA equipment and states obsession with sound quality through objective testing methodology [4]. The company demonstrates contemporary materials engineering with beryllium PVD coating and carbon fiber composite development, showing innovative approach to driver construction. However, significant cost allocation toward premium materials (walnut wood, beryllium coating, zinc construction) fails to produce demonstrably superior measured performance, as evidenced by problematic THD measurements despite premium materials investment. The design philosophy emphasizes natural timbre through neutral profile with subtle warmth while maintaining modularity for serviceability and longevity [9]. The approach lacks integration of digital signal processing, software enhancements, or advanced functional capabilities available in contemporary audio products. While measurement-focused development approach demonstrates scientific validity, the failure to achieve superior measured performance despite substantial premium materials investment raises questions about cost-effectiveness and resource allocation priorities.

## Advice

For potential purchasers seeking open-back headphones, the Meze Audio 109 PRO's 799 USD price cannot be justified by measured acoustic performance. The Sennheiser HD 560S at 170 USD provides superior measured THD performance, better frequency response neutrality, and equivalent functionality, offering over 4x better cost-performance. The Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X at approximately 290 USD similarly provides superior measured performance with neutral tuning. The 109 PRO's premium materials and craftsmanship represent aesthetic and build quality advantages rather than acoustic performance benefits. Consider these alternatives unless specific aesthetic preferences for handcrafted walnut wood housing and premium materials justify the substantial price premium over acoustically superior options. The documented early unit failures suggest waiting for production maturity if selecting this model. For buyers prioritizing measured acoustic performance over premium materials, alternative options provide significantly better value propositions.
