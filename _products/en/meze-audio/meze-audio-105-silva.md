## Overview

The Meze Audio 105 Silva is an open-back headphone featuring 50mm dynamic drivers with carbon fiber-reinforced cellulose composite dome and titanium coating applied through Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) process. Priced at 499 USD, the headphones incorporate walnut wood ear cups and include a USB-C adapter with integrated DAC/amplifier. The product represents Meze Audio's approach to combining premium materials with contemporary driver technology, targeting the mid-to-high-end personal audio market with impedance of 42Ω and sensitivity of 112 dB/mW.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Scientific Validity evaluation based on available manufacturer specifications shows intermediate performance levels. Manufacturer specifications include impedance (42Ω), sensitivity (112 dB/mW at 1 kHz), frequency range (5 Hz - 30 kHz), and THD <0.1% at 1kHz [1]. The THD specification of <0.1% falls between excellent (<0.05%) and problematic (0.5%) levels for headphones, representing adequate but not outstanding distortion performance. While comprehensive third-party measurements for S/N ratio, crosstalk, dynamic range, and frequency response deviation are not available from credible sources, the available manufacturer THD data provides audio-quality-relevant information for evaluation. Conservative evaluation moving score 0.1 toward 0.5 applied due to absence of third-party measurements, resulting in intermediate performance assessment based on manufacturer specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The 105 Silva demonstrates high technology level through advanced driver construction and material engineering. The carbon fiber-reinforced cellulose composite dome with titanium coating represents proprietary patent technology involving sophisticated Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) coating processes. In-house driver design incorporates multiple specialized materials including copper-zinc stabilizer and titanium coating, demonstrating contemporary material engineering approaches with carbon fiber reinforcement. The technical implementation shows significant accumulation of know-how in driver construction with advanced integration of materials science. Technology adoption focuses on cutting-edge material combinations that other manufacturers would find attractive to adopt, representing meaningful technical advancement in driver design and construction methods.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Cost-Performance evaluation identifies the Sennheiser HD6XX at 179 USD (current sale price, regular 219 USD) [2] as equivalent-or-better alternative with superior measured performance. Equipped with open-back design and comprehensive specifications, THD <0.05% and frequency response 10Hz-41kHz are equivalent-or-better compared to 105 Silva's THD <0.1% and 5Hz-30kHz range. The HD6XX demonstrates superior distortion performance meeting excellent standards (<0.05%) versus the 105 Silva's intermediate performance. Additional alternatives include HiFiMAN Sundara at 279 USD [3] with measured THD performance and extended frequency response 6-75kHz. Current market price for 105 Silva is 499 USD. CP = 179 USD ÷ 499 USD = 0.4

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Reliability and support evaluation shows above-average performance through modular design approach and established manufacturer backing. Construction features stated "fully serviceable with every chassis part easily disassembled," indicating robust design inherently resistant to degradation. Warranty coverage provides 2 years for EU customers and 1 year for non-EU customers, representing standard period coverage. Support infrastructure includes global warranty coverage with regional variations and standard email support through established channels. Meze Audio demonstrates high reliability track record as established manufacturer with significant experience in premium headphone development and production, contributing to confidence in long-term support availability and product reliability expectations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Design philosophy evaluation reveals mixed approach balancing advanced material engineering with premium positioning. The company demonstrates measurement focus for flagship products with published THD specifications below 0.05% for higher-end models, but lacks public measurement data for the 105 Silva itself. Significant portion of 499 USD pricing appears attributed to premium materials including walnut wood construction and premium cable components, which may not directly contribute to measured performance improvement relative to cost increase. USB-C adapter inclusion adds practical utility demonstrating appropriate functional integration. Advanced driver material engineering through titanium PVD coating and carbon fiber composite construction represents contemporary approach to driver development with meaningful innovation in material combinations and construction methods, showing positive innovation attitude toward technical advancement.

## Advice

The Meze Audio 105 Silva targets users seeking premium materials and high sensitivity open-back headphones, but faces significant cost-performance challenges. Potential purchasers should consider that superior measured performance is available at substantially lower prices, with the Sennheiser HD6XX at 179 USD (current sale price, regular 219 USD) offering THD <0.05% versus the 105 Silva's THD <0.1%. The HiFiMAN Sundara at 279 USD also provides equivalent-or-better measured performance with extended frequency response. Purchase justification requires prioritizing premium materials and aesthetics over measured performance value. Users focused on pure performance should consider lower-priced alternatives with superior measurement specifications. The included USB-C adapter provides practical value for portable device users, though this convenience does not overcome the significant cost-performance disadvantage relative to established alternatives.
