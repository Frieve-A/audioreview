## Overview

The AirPulse A200 is a two-way active bookshelf speaker designed by Phil Jones. It pairs a 5.5-inch aluminum-alloy mid-woofer with a horn-loaded ribbon tweeter (with phase correction) in 25 mm-thick MDF enclosures. A built-in amplifier handles multiple inputs including optical/coaxial digital, balanced/analog, and Bluetooth for an all-in-one setup [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specs list 46 Hz–20 kHz frequency response and ≥90 dB(A) S/N [1]. Independent, standardized anechoic measurements (e.g., on-axis ±dB windows and THD vs SPL sweeps) are limited in the public domain, so we keep a neutral 0.5 and will revise if robust third-party data emerges.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The combination of a horn-loaded ribbon tweeter for directivity control, an aluminum mid-woofer, thick MDF cabinetry with internal damping, and integrated multi-input amplification reflects above-average, sensible engineering for modern active speakers [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

US market price as of today is **1,199 USD** for the A200 [2]. The **cheapest equal-or-better alternative from a user perspective** is a minimal bundle that matches functions and measured performance:

- **JBL 305P MkII (pair)** – 318 USD [5]; studio monitor with extensive third-party measurements showing neutral response and controlled directivity [3][4].  
- **Fosi Audio Q4 DAC** (optical/coaxial→RCA, plus USB) – 69.99 USD [6].  
- **1Mii B06S Bluetooth receiver** (aptX family support) – 35.99 USD [7].

This bundle restores the A200’s digital inputs and Bluetooth while relying on a well-measured monitor platform.

**Calculation**: 423.98 USD ÷ 1,199 USD = 0.3536… → **0.4** (rounded to 1 decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Edifier’s global distribution/support footprint is established, but quantified reliability metrics and extended-warranty specifics are not broadly published. No category-critical firmware requirements apply. We rate average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The A200’s design emphasizes features with measurable value (directivity control via horn-loaded ribbon, solid cabinetry, integrated I/O) and avoids pseudo-technical claims. Price is on the high side, but the integration rationale is clear.

## Advice

Choose the A200 if you want an attractive, **single-box** active solution with **optical/coaxial digital and Bluetooth built-in** and like ribbon-tweeter dispersion traits. If you’re optimizing **performance per dollar**, a **305P MkII pair + small DAC + BT receiver** achieves equivalent functionality and strong, independently-verified performance for far less.
