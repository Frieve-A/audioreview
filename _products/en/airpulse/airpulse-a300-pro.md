## Overview

The Airpulse A300 Pro represents Phil Jones' latest iteration in active bookshelf speaker design, combining traditional acoustic engineering with modern digital processing. Features a 6.5-inch magnesium-aluminum woofer and 65mm horn-loaded ribbon tweeter, powered by dedicated Class D amplifiers delivering 120W+120W for woofers and 10W+10W for tweeters. Incorporates XMOS xCore200 processing, KleerNet wireless inter-speaker transmission, and comprehensive connectivity including Bluetooth 5.0 with AptX HD. Designed as the flagship model in Edifier's Airpulse range, targeting audiophiles seeking high-end active monitoring solutions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Frequency response quoted as 40Hz-40kHz with bass extension to approximately 40Hz according to manufacturer specifications. Signal-to-noise ratio of ≥90dB(A) positions between problematic (80dB) and transparent (105dB) levels for speakers according to established criteria. Power specifications confirmed as 120W+120W for woofers and 10W+10W for tweeters across manufacturer sources [2]. Sound on Sound reports conflicting 70W+70W power ratings using TAS5754 chips [1], but this appears to reference the original A300 model rather than the A300 Pro. Digital inputs support up to 192kHz sample rates through USB, optical, and coaxial connections. Conservative evaluation applied due to absence of comprehensive third-party THD, IMD, and crosstalk measurements essential for transparent performance verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Incorporates KleerNet proprietary wireless transmission technology operating on 5.2GHz and 5.8GHz spectrum with 22MHz bandwidth for lossless inter-speaker communication. Features XMOS xCore200 multi-core processor paired with Texas Instruments TLV320AIC3268 DSP chip for digital crossover and signal processing. Phil Jones in-house acoustic design demonstrates decades of accumulated know-how in transducer development. Horn-loaded ribbon tweeter implementation extends frequency response to 40kHz with enhanced transient response. Class D amplification implemented using Texas Instruments TPA3251 chips as confirmed by manufacturer specifications [2]. Earlier Sound on Sound report of TAS5754 chips with 768kHz PWM carrier frequency [1] refers to the original A300 model, not the A300 Pro variant. Advanced integration of digital processing, wireless transmission, and dedicated amplification represents contemporary but not cutting-edge technology implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

At 1999 USD current market price [5], comparison analysis reveals Fluance Ai61 at 300 USD provides equivalent user-facing functionality and measured performance [3]. Both products feature 6.5-inch drivers, 120W amplification, DSP processing, Bluetooth 5.0, multiple connectivity options (RCA, optical, USB), and subwoofer outputs. Driver type differences (ribbon vs silk dome tweeter) represent internal construction variations that do not change user-visible functions or measured performance according to established evaluation criteria. Wireless inter-speaker transmission provides convenience but does not constitute essential functionality for basic active speaker operation. CP = 300 USD ÷ 1999 USD = 0.15, rounded to 0.2. The A300 Pro's premium positioning reflects specialized features rather than fundamental performance advantages over lower-cost alternatives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Two-year warranty coverage in USA and Canada meets standard industry expectations. Robust construction features 25mm MDF cabinet walls with 36mm professional wave-absorbing material and magnesium alloy driver frames. Global support infrastructure through Edifier manufacturing and distribution network provides reasonable service accessibility. Customer service reports indicate mixed experiences with one documented case of inadequate response to mechanical failure [4]. DIN connector choice for power connection noted as questionable design decision for power transmission applications. Phil Jones design heritage and Edifier manufacturing track record provide reasonable reliability expectations, though specific failure rate data unavailable.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Phil Jones background in audio measurement and transducer development demonstrates scientific approach to acoustic design. Investment in measurable improvements including dedicated amplification, DSP-based crossover, and high-quality driver materials. Active design philosophy eliminates external amplification requirements while providing optimized driver-amplifier matching. Wireless inter-speaker transmission addresses practical installation concerns without compromising signal quality. Cost allocation toward functional improvements including ribbon tweeter technology and wireless transmission justifies premium positioning. Contemporary technology adoption through XMOS processing and Class D amplification demonstrates progressive engineering approach rather than adherence to outdated methodologies.

## Advice

Recommended for users specifically requiring wireless inter-speaker transmission, as this feature provides installation convenience unavailable in lower-cost alternatives. Buyers prioritizing cost-effectiveness should consider Fluance Ai61 or similar options offering equivalent active functionality at substantially lower cost. The A300 Pro's premium positioning reflects specialized wireless transmission technology rather than fundamental performance advantages. Consider placement requirements as ribbon tweeter directivity may limit optimal listening positions.
