## Overview

AdPower Sonic is an audio equipment sheet said to apply static electricity removal technology from the automotive AdPower series. Marketed for sound quality improvement by attaching it to speaker ports and baffle surfaces, it is a thin sheet (from 16×32×0.5mm to 36×98×0.5mm) sold at 47 USD for the M size and 67 USD for the L size. The product claims audio improvement through static electricity removal, but no scientific verification data or measurement results are provided.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

No scientifically valid measurement data is provided regarding this product's sound improvement effects. While the manufacturer claims an improvement in IACC (Interaural Cross-Correlation), this is not recognized as an objective indicator of sound quality and does not demonstrate actual improvement in the audible range. The claim of sound quality improvement through static electricity removal has not been verified by ABX or blind tests, making a placebo effect highly probable. No improvement data exists for metrics emphasized in our measurement standards, such as frequency response, THD, or SNR.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

AdPower Sonic's technology is extremely simple, involving the attachment of a sheet-like material with claimed static electricity removal effects to audio equipment. No patented technology or unique design elements have been confirmed, and it essentially remains within the category of an adhesive sheet. A scientific analysis of the impact of static electricity on audio signals and a technical explanation of the specific removal mechanism are insufficient. No true technological innovation or elements contributing to the industry are apparent.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The AdPower Sonic M size price of 47 USD is remarkably expensive compared to alternative products with similar static electricity removal functions. A comparable product for this purpose is TRUSCO's "Static Electricity Removal Tape SDT255" (25mm width × 5m, actual market price 11 USD), which has a proven track record in industrial applications. The cost-performance is rated at 0.2 based on the calculation: 11 USD ÷ 47 USD = 0.234... However, it is important to note that neither product has been scientifically proven to provide clear sound quality improvements through static electricity removal.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As the product is a physical, sheet-like device, the risk of failure is considered low. The manufacturer continues to sell the product, confirming the company's operational status. However, detailed information regarding the verification of its effects and the support system is lacking, resulting in an evaluation at the industry average level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy of improving sound quality by removing static electricity is an irrational approach that lacks a scientific basis. In modern audio equipment design, the influence of static electricity on audible sound quality is already addressed through proper circuit design and shielding. It does not contribute to achieving the transparency levels of our measurement standards; rather, it has a strong element of impeding consumers' rational judgment with pseudoscientific claims. To achieve genuine sound quality improvement, investing in scientifically proven methods is the rational choice.

## Advice

Purchasing AdPower Sonic is not recommended. If static electricity mitigation is the goal, it is more rational to consider an industrial product like TRUSCO's "Static Electricity Removal Tape," which is far more affordable. However, it is essential to understand that the sound quality improvement effects of any such product are not scientifically verified. For those seeking to enhance audio quality, the most reliable choices are equipment selection based on measurement data, proper setup, and investment in room acoustic treatments with scientifically proven effects. Expensive accessories that claim pseudoscientific benefits should be avoided.
