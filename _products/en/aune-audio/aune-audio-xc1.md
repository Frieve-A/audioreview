## Overview

The Aune XC1 is an external 10 MHz OCXO clock with four isolated, simultaneous outputs (two sine, two square). Key published specs include output power >7 dBm (50 Ω), rise time <2.75 ns, factory frequency accuracy <1 ppm, typical “audio stability” <10 ppt, and warm-up indicators (approx. 5 minutes basic / 60 minutes full) [1][2]. Street price is 299 USD [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While OCXO technology offers excellent frequency stability and the XC1 publishes sensible numeric specs [1][2], multiple technical evaluations find that **using an external master clock rarely improves — and can sometimes worsen — the performance of a single digital device compared to its internal clock** [4][5]. A broader engineering review likewise concludes an outboard master clock is **not** an effective route to sound-quality gains in typical single-device setups [6]. Therefore, audible efficacy remains limited despite sound engineering.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The XC1’s implementation is practical: simultaneous sine/square outputs, >7 dBm (50 Ω) drive, clear warm-up indication, and tidy OCXO integration [1][2]. Distributor materials also note extensive use of Panasonic ECPU capacitors (“88%” usage across PCBA) [2][7]. Overall execution is solid, if not groundbreaking.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Comparator (equivalent-or-better):** Gustard C16 (10 MHz OCXO, multiple BNC outputs, low-phase-noise positioning), 659 USD [8]. Above this, Mutec’s REF10 is 3,599 USD and REF10 NANO is 1,999 USD [9]; Cybershaft’s OCXO models start around 2,230 USD [10].  
**XC1 price:** 299 USD [3].  
**Assessment:** Among **finished** 10 MHz OCXO clocks with multi-output capability, no cheaper equivalent was found as of 2025-08-15. CP is therefore maxed at 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

A 1-year warranty is indicated [2]. The design is straightforward and should be robust, but long-term field reliability data are scarce. Support footprint is smaller than that of large EU makers, so we score it average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product is rational for **multi-device sync** use cases, yet for single-device playback the audible case is weak per published tests and expert commentary [4][5][6].

## Advice

- For synchronizing multiple digital components, the XC1’s four isolated outputs at 299 USD make it a cost-effective tool.  
- For **sound-quality upgrades in a single-device chain**, prioritize proven improvements (room acoustics, speaker placement, transparent electronics) over external clocking [4][6].
