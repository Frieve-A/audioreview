## Overview

The JCally JM20 Max is a portable DAC/amp dongle from the JCally brand operated by Dongguan JieShi Acoustic Technology (established 2015), China. It adopts a dual-chip configuration with a CS43131 DAC chip and an SGM8262 amp chip, providing USB-C to 3.5mm conversion functionality. The company employs 268 production staff and is known for budget-oriented Hi-Fi audio equipment and OEM services. This product claims support for 32bit/384kHz PCM and DSD256, featuring adaptive output corresponding to a wide impedance range of 16-600Ω.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance is excellent, achieving THD+N <0.001% and SNR >120dB. For THD+N, it demonstrates performance significantly exceeding the transparent level (0.01% or below), and the S/N ratio also greatly clears the transparent level (105dB or above). Frequency response covers 20Hz-20kHz, though detailed deviation data is not publicly available. The combination of the CS43131 DAC chip and SGM8262 amp supports a wide impedance range of 16-600Ω, capable of driving high-impedance headphones. These measured values are at a level that brings auditorily meaningful improvements, and its scientific validity can be highly evaluated.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The dual-chip configuration of the CS43131 and SGM8262 is a standard approach in the industry, but represents an appropriate technical choice. The CS43131 was originally highly rated as a high-end DAC chip and currently achieves an excellent price-performance ratio in the mid-range segment. The combination with the SGM8262 amp ensures sufficient output power. Support for 32bit/384kHz PCM and DSD256 is reasonable for current technical standards but is not particularly innovative technology. In terms of design originality and patent technology, it is standard, and the technology level is evaluated as slightly above the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The JCally JM20 Max has a market price of approximately 53 USD. As a comparison target with equivalent functionality, the FiiO KA11 (30 USD) equipped with a single CS43131 chip can be cited. The FiiO KA11 also supports 32bit/384kHz PCM and DSD256, and its output power of 200mW@32Ω surpasses this unit's 140mW@32Ω. The cost-performance calculation is: 30 USD ÷ 53 USD = 0.56, which rounds to 0.6. While it features a dual-chip configuration, there is no performance advantage to justify the price difference. Due to the existence of a cheaper and more powerful alternative, its cost-performance receives an average evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The manufacturing company, Dongguan JieShi Acoustic Technology, was established in 2015 and is a medium-sized company with 268 production staff. The warranty period is 3 months, which is below the industry average, and detailed information about after-sales support systems is limited. As an emerging Chinese manufacturer, it has built certain achievements, but public information regarding long-term reliability data and failure rates is lacking. There is also no clear information about repair systems or firmware update support. It is evaluated at an industry-average level for reliability and support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The product concept of a USB-C to 3.5mm conversion DAC dongle is a rational solution for modern smartphones and notebook PCs that have eliminated 3.5mm jacks. The choice of the CS43131 DAC chip is an appropriate decision considering the balance of price and performance, with a scientific basis for audio quality improvement. The wide impedance support of 16-600Ω realizes versatility that can handle various headphones and earphones. With plug-and-play support, convenience is also high, and there is a necessity for its existence as a dedicated device. The direction contributing to achieving the transparent level in measurement result standards is rational, and the design philosophy is scientific and practical.

## Advice

The JCally JM20 Max is an excellent product in terms of measurement performance but requires careful consideration from a cost-performance perspective. While it achieves excellent figures of THD+N <0.001% and SNR >120dB, the existence of the FiiO KA11 for 30 USD makes its 53 USD price setting feel overpriced. It's important to note that despite its dual-chip configuration, its output power is lower than that of the FiiO KA11. If budget is a priority, the FiiO KA11 would be a more rational choice. On the other hand, if you find appeal in the texture or design of JCally products, it could be an option. The short 3-month warranty period is also a consideration. We recommend thoroughly examining other options in the same price range before purchase.
