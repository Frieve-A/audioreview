## Overview

The JCally JM6 Pro is a USB-C to 3.5 mm DAC dongle that pairs a Conexant CX31993 USB audio codec with a Maxim MAX97220 headphone amplifier in a metal shell. It weighs about 6 g, measures ~110 mm, supports PCM up to 32-bit/384 kHz, and passes headset microphones (CTIA) through for calls. These are manufacturer-published specs. [1][2]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate transparency-class performance: signal-to-noise ratio 124 dB, THD+N −95 dB (≈0.0018 %), and crosstalk −110 dB, which are consistent with audibly transparent playback in typical use. Independent third-party bench measurements specific to JM6 Pro have not yet been located; until such data appears, these values should be treated as provisional manufacturer specs. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The architecture—USB codec (CX31993) feeding a dedicated headphone driver (MAX97220)—is a competent, common solution for dongles. Execution details like the aluminum housing and braided cable are solid but conventional. No unique topology, patents, or notable new techniques are evident from public materials. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Current market price is 17 USD for JM6 Pro. [1] The cheapest equivalent-or-better option is Apple’s USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter at 9 USD, which provides the same user-facing function and has repeatedly measured very low output impedance (~0.5–0.9 Ω) and low distortion consistent with transparency. Therefore **CP = 9 USD ÷ 17 USD = 0.53 → 0.5** (rounded to one decimal). [3][4][5]

*Equivalence note:* Apple’s adapter offers the same USB-C to 3.5 mm analog output and transparent measured behavior (low output impedance and low distortion), so it qualifies as “equivalent-or-better” from a user perspective. [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Warranty coverage varies by retailer: JCally’s regional distributor lists **4 months** for audio adapters, some stores state **3 months**, while other large retailers (e.g., HiFiGo) advertise **1 year** for dongles. There is no centralized global warranty statement. The product itself requires no firmware, reducing potential software failure modes, but long-term reliability data is sparse. [6][7][8]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Focusing on a proven codec-plus-amp chain to hit transparent-class specs at a very low price is a rational, measurement-oriented approach. The design avoids extravagance and targets objective performance; however, it does not advance the technical state of the art beyond established dongle designs. [1]

## Advice

If you want a simple, inexpensive wired output for IEMs and easy-to-drive headphones, JM6 Pro should perform audibly transparent based on the published numbers. If you need more voltage/current for insensitive planars or high-impedance headphones, step up to a higher-power dongle or a dedicated portable amp. If the lowest possible spend is the priority and a fixed-cable form factor is acceptable, Apple’s USB-C adapter remains the baseline bargain. [3][4][5]
