## Overview

The JCally JM6 Pro is a USB-C to 3.5mm DAC dongle featuring dual DAC implementation with Conexant CX31993 and Maxim MAX97220 chips. Weighing 6g and measuring 110mm, this portable audio adapter targets users seeking improved audio quality from smartphones and computers. The device supports PCM up to 32-bit/384kHz and provides microphone passthrough functionality for headset compatibility.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The JM6 Pro achieves transparent-level performance based on manufacturer specifications. Signal-to-noise ratio of 124dB exceeds the 105dB threshold for transparent operation [1]. THD+N of -95dB (0.0018%) falls well within the transparent range below 0.01% [1]. Crosstalk suppression of -110dB significantly exceeds the -70dB transparent threshold [1]. These specifications indicate the device should operate without audible degradation for typical listening scenarios. However, independent third-party measurements are not yet available to verify these manufacturer claims.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The dual-DAC configuration combining CX31993 and MAX97220 represents competent but conventional engineering. The CX31993 provides the primary DAC function while MAX97220 handles amplification duties. This approach demonstrates understanding of signal chain optimization but lacks notable innovation. The 5N OFC silver-plated cable construction and aluminum housing show attention to implementation details. However, the technology remains within established industry practices without advancing the state of portable DAC design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

At 14 USD current market price, the JM6 Pro competes with the Apple USB-C to 3.5mm adapter at 9 USD. Equipped with dual DAC implementation and manufacturer-specified 124dB SNR, the comparison yields CP = 9 USD ÷ 14 USD = 0.6. The Apple adapter demonstrates excellent measured performance with 0.9Ω output impedance and transparent audio quality [2], providing equivalent functionality for basic listening applications despite simpler single-chip design.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

JCally provides standard 3-month warranty coverage typical of budget Chinese audio manufacturers. The company maintains presence through established retailers like HiFiGo with after-sales service. However, long-term reliability data remains limited given the relatively new market position. The simple design with no firmware requirements reduces potential failure points, though build quality consistency across production batches is unverified.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The JM6 Pro pursues a rational approach to portable DAC design by focusing on measured performance rather than marketing claims. The dual-DAC implementation addresses power and noise considerations systematically. Supporting high-resolution PCM formats aligns with technical requirements, though practical benefits remain limited for typical content. The emphasis on objective specifications over subjective marketing demonstrates scientifically-oriented development philosophy, contributing to transparent audio reproduction goals.

## Advice

For users seeking cost-effective improvement over smartphone built-in audio or basic dongles, the JM6 Pro offers measurable benefits at minimal cost. The device suits sensitive earphones and moderate-impedance headphones below 160Ω. Consider this option when transparent audio reproduction is prioritized over brand prestige or premium build materials. Users requiring extensive power output for high-impedance headphones should consider dedicated headphone amplifiers instead.
