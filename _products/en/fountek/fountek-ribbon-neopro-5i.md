## Overview

The Fountek Ribbon NeoPro 5i is a large ribbon tweeter manufactured by China's Fountek Electronics. It features a 145mm×15mm×0.015mm reinforced sandwich diaphragm (effective area 2175mm²) and achieves ultra-wideband reproduction from 850Hz-40kHz through a powerful 1.0 Tesla neodymium magnetic circuit and sealed rear chamber. Key specifications include 7Ω impedance matching via built-in transformer, high 102dB/2.83V@1m sensitivity, and 60W rated power handling. This professional-grade ribbon tweeter is highly regarded in the DIY audio community.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Third-party measurements show the NeoPro 5i achieves ±2dB from 1.5kHz-8.5kHz and ±3.5dB from 1.5kHz-40kHz frequency response, with a minor peak around 12kHz [1]. Primary resonance occurs at 250Hz with secondary resonances at 670Hz, and minimum impedance is 5.31Ω at 2.71kHz. Compression at 110dB/1m output is extremely low at 0.3dB, achieving exceptionally low distortion levels when used with crossovers above 1400Hz. The lightweight 88mg diaphragm design delivers excellent transient characteristics, approaching transparent performance levels (±0.5dB, THD below 0.01%).

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 3rd generation ribbon technology employs a 145mm×15mm×0.015mm thin-film aluminum diaphragm that achieves improved efficiency and extended bandwidth compared to predecessors. Features include a 1.0 Tesla neodymium magnetic circuit, sealed rear chamber design, dual aluminum heat sinks, and built-in transformer system providing 7Ω impedance matching. The lightweight 88mg diaphragm optimizes resonance damping with 0.02Ω DCR low-resistance characteristics. While demonstrating high technical competence through proprietary design, it falls short of industry-leading innovation levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The NeoPro 5i's street price is 371.86 EUR at SoundImports as of 2025-08-10 [2]. As a comparator with equal-or-better capabilities, Fountek's larger NeoPro 10i is 854.05 EUR and exceeds 5i in diaphragm area and power handling; no cheaper product with strictly equal-or-better functional and measured performance was found. CP calculation example: 854.05 EUR ÷ 371.86 EUR = 2.30 → MIN(1.0, 2.30) = 1.0. Thus among equal-or-better options, 5i is effectively the lowest price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Fountek Electronics has over 20 years of experience as a specialized speaker driver manufacturer since 2003. The company states RoHS-compliant quality control and holds multiple patents. The NeoPro 5i's robust, professional design suggests durability; however, distribution and after-sales support vary by region and retailer.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design employs scientifically-grounded approaches targeting measurable improvements: extended bandwidth through large diaphragm, improved transients via weight reduction, and high efficiency through strong magnetic circuits. The sealed rear chamber and heat sink design for thermal management, plus built-in transformer for practical impedance matching, represent rational design decisions. Low distortion characteristics above 1400Hz and minimal compression at 110dB output demonstrate appropriate design optimization toward transparent performance levels. Technical rationality merits high evaluation.

## Advice

The Fountek Ribbon NeoPro 5i suits DIY builders seeking large ribbon tweeter acoustic characteristics and system builders requiring professional-grade high-power handling. Its excellent transient response and ultra-wideband reproduction enable detailed high-frequency reproduction. However, compared to equivalent-performance AMT tweeters, it carries a price premium with limited availability channels. Budget-conscious users should consider alternatives, while those prioritizing acoustic characteristics should allow adequate evaluation time.
