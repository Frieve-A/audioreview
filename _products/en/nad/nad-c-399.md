## Overview

The NAD C-399 HybridDigital DAC Amplifier represents NAD's integration of high-end technologies into their Classic Series, featuring Hypex nCore amplification previously exclusive to their Masters Series. This integrated amplifier delivers 180W per channel continuous power with 250W instantaneous capability, incorporating a 32-bit/384kHz ESS Sabre ES9028 DAC, dual MDC2 modular expansion ports, MM phono stage, dedicated headphone amplifier, and Bluetooth aptX HD connectivity. Priced at 1999 USD, the C-399 combines proven amplification technology with comprehensive digital and analog connectivity in a modular platform designed for future expansion.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The C-399 demonstrates exceptional measured performance across most audio quality criteria. Third-party measurements from SoundStage Network confirm frequency response of ±0.02dB from 20Hz to 20kHz, significantly exceeding the transparent level benchmark of ±0.5dB [1]. Harmonic distortion performance is outstanding at <0.002% THD+N at typical listening levels, well below the 0.01% transparent threshold. The digital section achieves 116.5dB dynamic range at 24/96, substantially exceeding the 105dB transparent level.

Power output measurements of 198W into 8 ohms and 235W into 4 ohms exceed NAD's conservative 180W specification. The damping factor of 1442 significantly surpasses the 100+ transparent level requirement. Crosstalk measurements show -89.9dB (left channel) exceeding the -70dB transparent threshold, though the right channel at -68.0dB approaches but doesn't quite reach this level.

The primary limitation is speaker output signal-to-noise ratio at 94.6dB A-weighted, which falls between the problematic (80dB) and transparent (105dB) benchmarks, though the dedicated headphone output achieves 109dB. Overall performance places the C-399 well above transparent thresholds for most critical specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The C-399 incorporates several advanced technologies, with the Hypex nCore amplification representing cutting-edge Class D implementation previously limited to NAD's premium Masters Series. The ESS Sabre ES9028 DAC represents current high-performance digital conversion technology, though input capability is limited to 24-bit/192kHz despite the chip's 32-bit/384kHz potential. NAD's proprietary MDC2 (Modular Design Construction) platform demonstrates innovation in expandability, enabling two-way communication between modules and host unit for future upgrades.

While core amplification and DAC technologies are licensed rather than developed in-house, NAD's integration expertise and the modular platform architecture show technical sophistication. The combination of proven technologies with proprietary expansion capabilities reflects appropriate contemporary technology adoption without unnecessary complexity. The MDC2 system provides genuine competitive differentiation, as other manufacturers in this category typically offer fixed functionality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At the current market price of 1999 USD, the C-399 represents exceptional value as no competing products with equivalent or better user-facing functions and measured performance are available at lower cost. The Cambridge Audio EVO 150 at 3000 USD provides the closest equivalent functionality with 150W continuous power, MM phono stage, ESS Sabre ES9018K2M DAC implementation, and comprehensive digital connectivity including streaming capabilities. Equipped with similar digital input options, phono capability, and frequency response and distortion performance are equivalent-or-better.

The C-399 is the world's cheapest product with equivalent functionality and measured performance, resulting in a cost-performance score of 1.0. While the EVO 150 offers integrated streaming functionality, the C-399's higher continuous power output (180W vs 150W), dual MDC2 modular expansion capability, and significantly lower price point establish it as the most cost-effective option for users requiring high-power integrated amplifier-DAC functionality with phono capability.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

NAD provides comprehensive support infrastructure through established global dealer networks and direct technical support channels. The company's 50+ year track record in audio equipment manufacturing demonstrates long-term stability and accumulated expertise in customer service. Support staff are available Monday through Friday during business hours, with comprehensive online resources including knowledge base and FAQ sections.

The C-399's solid-state design using proven Hypex nCore technology and established ESS DAC implementation should provide reliable long-term operation. The modular MDC2 system design allows for future expansion without complete unit replacement, extending useful product life. Construction appears robust with proper thermal management for the Class D amplification. Standard warranty coverage applies through authorized dealers, with labor and materials covered for defects, though shipping costs for warranty service are customer responsibility.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

NAD's design philosophy demonstrates exceptional scientific rationality with clear emphasis on measurable performance improvements and cost-effective engineering. The company's stated focus on "true-to-source sound" aligns with objective fidelity goals rather than subjective preferences. Their approach of including essential functionality while avoiding unnecessary complexity directly contributes to the C-399's competitive pricing and reliable operation.

The integration of proven technologies (Hypex nCore amplification, ESS Sabre DAC) with proprietary innovation (MDC2 modular platform) represents rational technology adoption. Rather than developing proprietary amplification or DAC technologies that might compromise performance or increase costs, NAD selected best-in-class components and focused innovation on practical user benefits through modularity. The philosophy of delaying product releases until achieving measurable performance targets demonstrates commitment to objective improvement over marketing schedules.

The modular platform concept addresses real user needs for upgradeability without forced obsolescence, representing forward-thinking design philosophy that balances current performance with future expansion capability.

## Advice

The NAD C-399 is highly recommended as the most cost-effective option providing the combination of high power output, modular expansion capability, and premium build quality. At 1999 USD, the C-399 offers excellent measured performance and proven technologies at exceptional value, with no equivalent alternatives available at lower cost. The unique MDC2 expansion system provides future-proofing for users planning system upgrades or requiring specific streaming/room correction modules.

The comprehensive connectivity including MM phono stage, multiple digital inputs, and dedicated headphone amplifier eliminates need for additional components in most systems. Users seeking equivalent audio performance will find significantly higher costs in alternatives like the Cambridge Audio EVO 150 at 3000 USD, making the C-399 the clear value leader in high-power integrated amplifier-DACs. The combination of 180W continuous power and modular platform makes this ideal for users with demanding speakers and plans for system expansion.
