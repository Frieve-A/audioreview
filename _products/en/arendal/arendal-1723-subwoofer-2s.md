## Overview

The Arendal 1723 Subwoofer 2S is a sealed subwoofer developed by Norwegian company Arendal Sound. It features dual 13.8-inch custom long-stroke drivers in a force-canceling configuration that neutralizes internal vibrations through advanced engineering. The unit incorporates a 1200W RMS Avalanche 1200 IQ amplifier with DSP control for precise adjustments. The HDF cabinet construction features internal bracing to effectively suppress resonance. Developed as part of the THX series, it is designed to handle both home theater and music listening applications. The robust 91-pound construction ensures stable performance even at high output levels.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Arendal 1723 Subwoofer 2S demonstrates excellent measured performance. It maintains THD below 1% at rated levels above 40Hz, and never exceeds 10% even at high output levels, achieving extremely clean output. The frequency response covers 17-200Hz (±3dB) range in EQ1 setting, providing excellent low-frequency reproduction capability for a sealed subwoofer. The force-canceling design reduces distortion by half compared to conventional designs, with no audible distortion even at maximum output in the mid-bass region. Time-domain performance is also excellent, with group delay well-controlled even below 40Hz. However, in the ultra-low frequency range below 25Hz, distortion tends to increase due to the physical constraints of sealed design.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The product employs numerous advanced technologies. The 13.8-inch custom long-stroke drivers feature aluminum shorting rings and vented pole pieces, combined with high-efficiency suspension to achieve deep bass reproduction with minimal distortion. The dual-driver force-canceling configuration is an innovative design that neutralizes physical reaction forces and halves distortion rates. The 1200W RMS Avalanche 1200 IQ amplifier combines fully discrete MOSFET output stages with advanced DSP control, enabling precise adjustments via smartphone app. The CNC-machined HDF cabinet with internal bracing effectively suppresses resonance, implementing technology that directly contributes to improved measured performance.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The 1723 Subwoofer 2S is priced at 2399 USD, but equivalent sealed subwoofer performance can be achieved with the SVS SB-2000 Pro at 799 USD. The SVS SB-2000 Pro features a 12-inch driver with 550W RMS amplifier and 19-240Hz (±3dB) frequency response, providing practical bass reproduction capability with comparable THD and output levels in measured tests. Calculation: 799 USD ÷ 2399 USD = 0.33. While the Arendal product offers added value through dual-driver configuration and high-power amplifier, the performance difference is not significant enough to justify the substantial price difference from a pure bass reproduction capability perspective. The distortion improvement from force-canceling design is technically meaningful, but offers limited advantage from a cost-performance standpoint.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Arendal Sound provides a 10-year warranty, exceeding industry standards and demonstrating confidence in their product. Norwegian technical standards and quality control provide reasonable reliability expectations. The direct-sales model enables consistent management from manufacturing to shipping and support, eliminating quality degradation risks from intermediaries. Global shipping and return policies reduce post-purchase risks. The DSP amplifier receives continuous firmware updates, enabling functional improvements for long-term use. However, as a relatively new company established in 2015, long-term track record is limited. Domestic repair and support structure in Japan is also constrained by the direct-sales model limitations compared to traditional dealer support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy of the Arendal 1723 Subwoofer 2S is highly rational. The force-canceling dual-driver design has physically proven distortion reduction effects, confirmed through measurements. The sealed design approach prioritizing accuracy over maximum output is a scientifically sound choice that prioritizes sound quality. DSP control precision adjustment functionality enables optimization according to room acoustic characteristics, directly contributing to improved measured performance. The adoption of 13.8-inch large drivers provides physical advantages for high-volume reproduction with low distortion. Development as part of the THX series ensures compliance with objective standards. The approach of eliminating unscientific claims and occult elements while focusing on measurement data-based performance improvement is extremely rational.

## Advice

The Arendal 1723 Subwoofer 2S is a suitable choice for users who prioritize technical completeness and measured performance. The distortion improvement from force-canceling design and excellent time-domain performance provide value for audiophiles who prioritize sound quality. The mid-bass reproduction quality is particularly high, excelling in textural expression of bass in music listening. However, from a price-to-performance ratio perspective, alternatives like the SVS SB-2000 Pro and Rythmik F25 exist at lower prices with equivalent practical performance. The 2399 USD price should be considered as an investment in technical added value. Limited audition opportunities due to the direct-sales model should also be considered. While purchase risk is reduced through the 10-year warranty and return policy, long-term support should be evaluated understanding the company's emerging status. This product is recommended for users seeking force-canceling technology and precise sound quality adjustment with sufficient budget.
