## Overview

The Campfire Audio IO is a dual balanced-armature in-ear monitor positioned as an entry point to Campfire’s premium lineup. Priced at 299 USD, it features the company’s T.A.E.C. (Tuned Acoustic Expansion Chamber) acoustic system and hand assembly in Portland, Oregon [2]. The IO uses an oversized woofer BA plus a tweeter in an anodized aluminum shell with beryllium-copper MMCX connectors [2]. As of this review date, IO appears in Campfire’s Product History rather than the current shop lineup [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Third-party measurements and reviews describe a sharp peak around 1–2 kHz followed by a significant recession through the upper mids, which undermines timbral accuracy for vocals and many instruments [3]. Manufacturer-published specs are: frequency response 5–22 kHz, 26 Ω impedance, and 109 dB SPL/mW sensitivity; these indicate adequate headroom but do not resolve the midrange balance issues identified in measurements [2]. Overall, the IO’s tuning diverges from widely accepted neutral targets, lowering its scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Campfire’s T.A.E.C. is a rational acoustic approach to BA treble implementation, avoiding traditional dampers by using a tuned chamber [5]. Construction quality is high—hand assembly in Portland, aluminum shells, and beryllium-copper MMCX jacks [2]. However, the dual-BA architecture is conventional by today’s standards, and competing designs achieve better measured fidelity at similar or lower prices.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

At 299 USD, the IO faces strong competition from models that meet or exceed its measured fidelity at much lower prices. For example, the Truthear HEXA (hybrid 1DD+3BA) is widely available at 89.99 USD and is recognized for measurement-aligned tuning (high sensitivity ~120 dB/Vrms, 20.5 Ω) and strong objective performance for the price [6][7].  
Simple CP calculation (policy display requirement): **79.99 USD ÷ 299 USD = 0.27 → 0.3**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Campfire offers a 2-year manufacturer warranty for earphones/cables and a 14-day return window (like-new condition required) [9][10]. The IO’s metal build and MMCX hardware are robust [2]. Lack of public failure-rate data prevents a higher score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The engineering choices (T.A.E.C., quality machining, robust connectors) are sensible. However, the intentional midrange tuning that deviates from neutral targets prioritizes a distinctive signature over measured fidelity. That trade-off limits the score despite solid build execution.

## Advice

Audition before purchase. If you value premium build and a distinctive, mid-skewed signature, the IO may appeal. If you prioritize measurement-aligned accuracy and value, alternatives like the Truthear HEXA deliver objectively superior fidelity at a fraction of the price [6][7].
