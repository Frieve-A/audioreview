## Overview

The Campfire Audio Fathom is a six balanced-armature in-ear monitor (dual super-tweeters, dual mids, dual woofers) in a three-way scheme the brand markets as “Phase Harmony Engineering.” The aluminum shells use black bright-dip anodizing with rainbow PVD fasteners; the box includes two **Time Stream** cables (3.5 mm and 4.4 mm), tips, and case. The current official US price is 799 USD. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Third-party IEC-711 frequency-response traces show upper-mid/treble departures beyond ±3 dB relative to neutral targets, so transparency criteria are not met. Independent distortion data remain limited. Manufacturer/retailer specs list **SPL 94 dB @ 1 kHz: 6.75 mVrms**, **impedance 11.7 Ω**, and **THD <1%** (not a transparent figure by headphone standards). With scarce third-party THD/IMD and the observed FR behavior, we start from the 0.5 baseline and adjust to **0.4**. [2][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design applies established Knowles/Sonion BA receivers with physical/acoustic damping under the **Phase Harmony** concept. Machined aluminum construction and dual included cables are well executed, yet no new transducer principle or verifiable breakthrough topology is introduced beyond careful implementation of known methods. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (functions & measurements from a user perspective):**  
- **Moondrop CHU II** (passive wired IEM, detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin). Independent lab measurements show neutral-leaning FR and low distortion; price **19 USD**. [4]  
- **Minimum add-on to match Fathom’s balanced cable in-box function:** **TRN T2 Pro** 4.4 mm balanced 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, **16.80 USD**. [6]  
- Fathom current market price: **799 USD**. [1]

**Simple division (required display):**  
(19 USD + 16.80 USD) ÷ 799 USD = 0.0448... → **0.0** after rounding to one decimal.  

Result: there exists a **much cheaper** path with **no worse** user-facing functions and measured performance, so CP is **0.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Campfire provides a **two-year** manufacturer warranty. Metal shells and hardware are robust, but BA receivers are sensitive to moisture/shock. As a passive design, firmware risks do not apply. Warranty length and retailer support are acceptable yet unexceptional, so we set **0.3**. [3]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The tuning aims for a neutral-warm presentation and uses multi-BA band segmentation; however, measured FR remains outside transparent thresholds and independent distortion evidence is limited. Given that **equal-or-better** measured results are available at a small fraction of the price, the design choices do not yield superior audible transparency per cost. [1][2][4]

## Advice

If you want an all-BA monitor with neutral-leaning tuning and strong value, prioritize **DUNU SA6 MK2** (579.99 USD) first; it offers similar user-facing functions with reputable results at a lower price. If topology flexibility is acceptable, **Moondrop Blessing 3** (319.99 USD) is another competent option with abundant measurement coverage. [5][7]
