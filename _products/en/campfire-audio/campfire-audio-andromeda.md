summary: "Five-BA IEM (including dual-diaphragm treble BAs) with excellent build and accessories, but priced far above measurement-proven alternatives like Etymotic ER2SE"

## Overview

The current Andromeda “Emerald Sea” uses five balanced armatures (with dual-diaphragm BAs in the highs), a precision-machined aluminum shell, MMCX connectors, and includes three cables (2.5/3.5/4.4 mm). Official US price is **1,399 USD**. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For the Emerald Sea revision, the **manufacturer specs** list **impedance 6.375 Ω (@1 kHz), sensitivity 94 dB (@1 kHz = 11.84 mVrms), and THD < 0.5%**. Independent, numbers-first third-party datasets (FR/THD ranges) remain limited as of this writing, so the **overall measurement picture is not fully established**. A reputable review notes **minimal output-impedance sensitivity** for Emerald Sea (flat impedance behavior), addressing a known issue on some prior Andromeda versions, but without standardized lab graphs. Provisional score: **0.5**, to be updated if robust third-party measurements emerge. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Dual-diaphragm BAs, TAEC, and a re-engineered shell reflect **incremental** refinements of established tech. In the absence of public third-party proof of **significant** FR/THD gains versus peers, we keep this at **0.5**. [1]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

- **Review target price (US)**: **1,399 USD**. [1]  
- **Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (single)**: **Etymotic ER2SE — 149.99 USD** (representative regular price).  
  - Functions: passive wired IEM with detachable MMCX cable — **equivalent**.  
  - Performance: **flat, measurement-driven FR** (B&K 5128) and **35–42 dB passive isolation (manufacturer)** — **equal or better** in user-relevant fidelity/isolation metrics. [3][4]

**Simple division**:  
**149.99 USD ÷ 1,399 USD = 0.107** → round to one decimal **0.1**.  

Short-term sale prices are excluded; we use representative regular pricing. [3]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Campfire states a **2-year manufacturer warranty** and maintains service information publicly. Passive design (no firmware). MMCX wear is a general caution. Overall **average** for the segment (0.6). [5]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The multi-BA + acoustic-chamber approach is **directionally rational** for controlling FR. However, without publicly confirmed third-party **measurement advantages** commensurate with price, we cannot award higher credit. Score **0.5**.

## Advice

- If you value **finish, included cables, and the Andromeda aesthetic/package**, Emerald Sea will appeal.  
- If you prioritize **measurement-led fidelity and isolation per dollar**, **Etymotic ER2SE (149.99 USD)** is a compelling alternative. [3][4]  
- Reports indicate **low output-impedance sensitivity** for Emerald Sea; typical low-Z dongles should be fine. [2]
