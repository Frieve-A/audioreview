## Overview

The BT-T100 is a Bluetooth 4.2 (Class 1) desktop transmitter that adds wireless audio to TVs and hi-fi gear. It supports aptX Low Latency/aptX/SBC, offers both optical (PCM 44.1/48 kHz) and 3.5 mm analog inputs, and can stream to **two** headphones at once—**note: aptX LL is disabled in dual-connection mode**. It stores up to **eight** pairing profiles. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

- Specified frequency response: **20 Hz–20 kHz**; Bluetooth profile: **A2DP**; RF output power: **10 mW (max)**. [1]  
- aptX LL targets **~40 ms** end-to-end latency when both ends support it. [2]  
- With two headphones connected, aptX LL is **not** used and perfect A/V sync is **not guaranteed**. [1]  
- No independent THD/SNR datasets found; this section relies on the manufacturer spec sheet and codec documentation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

A competent, conservative implementation: mature BT 4.2 platform, straightforward I/O and memory features, and no cutting-edge codec/BT stack beyond aptX LL.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Typical street price is about **80 USD** (example: an Amazon Renewed listing shows **77.77 USD**). [3]  
As the **cheapest equal-or-better** comparator, the **1Mii B03** provides aptX LL, dual-link (two headphones), and both optical/analog I/O—while using a newer BT stack—at **49.99 USD**. [4]  
Calculation (USD): **49.99 ÷ 80 = 0.6249… → 0.6**.  
Equivalence note: B03 matches the BT-T100’s user-visible functions (aptX LL, two-headphone streaming, optical+analog inputs) and meets/exceeds its platform specs. [4]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Backed by Sennheiser’s support network and a mature BT stack. Build is practical; firmware needs are minimal for this device type.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Focusing on low-latency TV use and broad input compatibility is rational. Innovation is limited, so value hinges on pricing versus functionally equivalent rivals.

## Advice

If you prioritize stable, low-latency TV listening and prefer a simple, powered desktop unit, the BT-T100 is a safe pick. If price is the priority, **1Mii B03 (49.99 USD)** offers the same core experience for less while adding a newer BT generation. [4]
