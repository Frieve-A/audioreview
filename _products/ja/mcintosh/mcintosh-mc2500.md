## Overview

The McIntosh MC2500 is a vintage solid-state stereo power amplifier manufactured from 1980 to 1990, delivering 500 watts per channel into 8 ohms or 1000 watts in mono configuration. Weighing 129 pounds and featuring McIntosh’s autoformer output coupling, it targets professional and high-end consumer applications. Dual rear-mounted fans handle thermal management, reflecting McIntosh’s traditional analog approach of the 1980s[1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer documentation specifies **THD 0.02%** (20Hz–20kHz at rated power), **frequency response 20Hz–20kHz (+0/−0.25dB)**, **damping factor >30**, and **noise & hum 95 dB below rated output**[4]. FR is tight, but THD and damping factor fall short of what today’s best designs achieve. Comprehensive third-party bench tests are limited; this assessment is therefore provisional and based primarily on manufacturer specs[1][4].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A classic Class AB design with autoformer coupling and linear PSU. Compared with modern Class D and advanced feedback implementations, efficiency and objective performance are modest, and there are few contemporary convenience features (e.g., triggers, network control)[1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Current used market pricing for the MC2500 is about **3,500 USD**[2]. The **cheapest equivalent-or-better** option we can identify is a **pair of Buckeye Amps Hypex NC2k monoblocks** at **1,225 USD each** (total **2,450 USD**). Using two monoblocks restores stereo functionality. The NC2k offers vastly higher output headroom (1600W/8Ω per mono) and superior objective performance (e.g., **THD 0.002% at 1250W/4Ω, 20Hz–20kHz**, **S/N 133 dB**), i.e., **equal-or-better** vs MC2500’s published specs[3][4].  
Calculation: **2,450 USD ÷ 3,500 USD = 0.70** → 0.7. For context, other NC2K-based monoblocks cost more (VTV **1,429 USD** each; Apollon **2,995€** each)[5][6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a discontinued product, factory support and parts availability are limited. Robust build can aid longevity, but decades of thermal cycling and electrolytic aging are common risks. Used units typically lack manufacturer warranty; repairs often require specialized expertise and can be costly[1][2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The emphasis on heavy chassis and autoformer coupling reflects a traditional philosophy rather than measurement-driven optimization. Considering the size/cost vs. measurable benefits (THD, S/N, load control), the approach is less rational today than modern, efficient designs delivering superior metrics at lower prices[1][4].

## Advice

Buy for collectible value, brand matching, or proven high-power pro use. If you need **≥500W/8Ω** per channel with better measured performance, a **dual NC2k monoblock setup** is a more rational purchase at a lower total price[3][5][6]. If such extreme power isn’t required, cheaper modern Class D (e.g., NCx500) offers excellent measurements but **does not meet** MC2500’s 8Ω continuous output; hence it’s not used as the CP baseline here[4].
