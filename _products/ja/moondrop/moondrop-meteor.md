## Overview

The Moondrop Meteor is the company's flagship tribrid IEM released in late 2024. It features a 7-driver configuration consisting of 1 dynamic driver, 2 balanced armatures, and 4 microplanar drivers, along with a distinctive faceplate that incorporates actual meteorite fragments. The design incorporates XTM composite technology for a dedicated crossover design and acoustic metamaterial filters for sound tuning. Priced at 510 USD, the Meteor is positioned as Moondrop's premium IEM tuned according to their VDSF Target Response curve.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The measured specifications of 18.5Ω impedance, 120dB/Vrms sensitivity, and a 9Hz-35kHz frequency response demonstrate generally good performance. The 120dB sensitivity meets the excellent level standard of 100dB or higher, and the low impedance design ensures good drivability with portable devices. However, the specified Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of ≤0.6% reaches the problematic level of 0.5% or higher for IEMs according to product category guidelines. While other specifications are good, this level of distortion is a notable drawback for a high-fidelity product.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 7-driver tribrid configuration and XTM composite technology crossover design demonstrate technical uniqueness. The use of 4 microplanar drivers for high-frequency reproduction and the acoustic metamaterial filters for suppressing peaks around 4.7kHz and 7.2kHz represent rational design approaches. The utilization of actual meteorite as a vibration damper is also an interesting engineering solution. However, considering the final measured performance, particularly the THD, it is questionable whether this complex technological investment directly translates to audibly meaningful improvements. While the technology level exceeds industry average standards, it cannot be considered a top-tier proprietary design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

At a price of 510 USD, a product like the Truthear ZERO:RED (approximately 55 USD) offers superior measured performance. The ZERO:RED demonstrates significantly lower THD across the entire frequency spectrum, providing superior fidelity from a user's perspective. The cost-performance calculation yields 55 USD ÷ 510 USD = 0.107, indicating that superior performance can be obtained at approximately 1/9th the price. Since decorative elements such as meteorite embedding are not included in functionality and performance evaluation, the pure performance-to-price ratio results in an extremely low rating.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Moondrop, as an established Chinese audio manufacturer, provides a 1-year product warranty and maintains a global sales network and support system. The cable comes with a 3-month warranty. No particular failure risks have been reported for their IEM products, and the standard 0.78mm 2-pin connection system ensures easy availability of replacement cables. However, the complex 7-driver configuration may potentially carry higher long-term failure risks compared to simpler designs. The support system can be evaluated as industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The tuning approach based on the VDSF Target Response curve and the design philosophy aimed at improving measurable acoustic characteristics are rational. The acoustic metamaterial filters for addressing specific frequency issues and the dedicated frequency band allocation for each driver are based on scientific principles. The attention to phase alignment through XTM composite technology also represents appropriate directional thinking. However, questions remain whether the complex 7-driver configuration was truly necessary, especially when it results in less-than-ideal THD performance. The possibility that superior measured performance could be achieved with simpler, more optimized configurations suggests some aspects of the technological investment may be over-engineered.

## Advice

The Moondrop Meteor is a product with technical interest and unique design, but it cannot be recommended from a cost-performance perspective. The acoustic performance obtained for 510 USD is surpassed by products like the Truthear ZERO:RED at around 55 USD. It would only be a viable option for those who find value in the meteorite embedding and complex driver configuration and have sufficient budget flexibility. For purchasers prioritizing pure sound quality, we strongly recommend considering products with superior measured performance, which are available at a fraction of the price. Unless you place special value on the Moondrop brand or the aesthetic design, it is not a rational choice.
