summary: "An American pioneer that has been innovating planar magnetic speakers in Minnesota for 55 years since its founding in 1969. The Magneplanar technology developed by founder Jim Winey in his basement realizes the openness and spatial reproduction that cannot be achieved with box speakers. Recent introduction of Quasi-ribbon technology has achieved even lower distortion rates. However, when compared purely by acoustic measurement performance, they are approximately 10 times more expensive than conventional speakers with equivalent performance, making cost-performance limited."

## Overview

Founded in 1969 based on the Magneplanar technology developed by Jim Winey in his basement, this American speaker manufacturer specializes in planar magnetic speakers. As a synonymous name for planar magnetic (planar magnetic) speakers, they have continued manufacturing in White Bear Lake, Minnesota for 55 years. The unique structure that drives a diaphragm made of thin Mylar film with aluminum foil attached within a magnetic field realizes openness and spatial reproduction impossible with conventional box speakers. Since 2010, they have introduced "Quasi-ribbon" technology that uses wide aluminum tape instead of conventional wire, achieving significant improvement in distortion rates.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Magnepan's bipolar design has measurable distinct acoustic characteristics. The characteristic of nearly zero phase change with a 4-ohm load provides an easy-to-drive load for amplifiers. Line source-like acoustic radiation suppresses reflections from floors and ceilings, minimizing the impact on the listening environment. The introduction of Quasi-ribbon technology has achieved measurably clear distortion improvement compared to conventional wire drive, realizing low distortion rates of THD+N below 0.1%. The forward and backward acoustic radiation from the bipolar design is clearly confirmed in measurements, and the resulting soundstage expansion is objectively measurable.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Since its founding in 1969, they have led the industry through continuous improvement of planar magnetic technology. The Quasi-ribbon technology introduced in 2010 uses 3mm wide aluminum tape with a thickness of 0.0012 inches, achieving significant performance improvement from conventional wire drive. The latest True-ribbon tweeter is made of pure aluminum and controlled by push-pull magnet arrangement. It has excellent electrical characteristics with a 4-ohm load and nearly zero phase change, achieving 86dB/W/m efficiency. All products are manufactured at their own factory in Minnesota, maintaining 55 years of technology accumulation and quality control systems.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

For products with measurement performance equivalent to the LRS+ (USD 1,200), the ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 (USD 147) with equivalent performance (THD+N below 0.1%, 86dB/W/m) can be cited. CP = USD 147 รท USD 1,200 = 0.12. For speakers with measurement performance equivalent to the MG 1.7i (USD 3,500), the KEF Q350 (USD 400) exists. CP = USD 400 รท USD 3,500 = 0.11. For products with frequency characteristics and distortion rates at the MG 2.7i (USD 6,500) level, the KEF R3 (USD 1,200) can be cited. CP = USD 1,200 รท USD 6,500 = 0.18. While the bipolar radiation characteristics unique to planar magnetic types have uniqueness, they are significantly more expensive in terms of pure acoustic measurement performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 55-year manufacturing record in Minnesota is evidence of reliability, but there are also challenges specific to planar magnetic types. There is potential for aging deterioration of Mylar film and performance degradation due to aging changes in magnets. Additionally, advanced techniques are required for installation and setup, with proper amplifier selection and consideration of room acoustic characteristics being essential. Detailed information about warranty periods and after-sales service is limited compared to conventional box speaker manufacturers. For repair support and parts supply, it may be difficult for general speaker repair services to handle due to the specialized diaphragm and magnet structure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The basic design of planar magnetic type is acoustically rational, fundamentally solving the problems of box resonance and standing waves in box speakers. The forward and backward acoustic radiation from the bipolar design is a rational approach to reduce the impact of the listening environment. However, due to physical limitations in the low frequency range, large size is required for full-range reproduction, creating constraints in general listening environments. There is also a design constraint that relatively low efficiency of 86dB/W/m requires high-power amplifiers. The introduction of Quasi-ribbon technology and True-ribbon tweeters can be evaluated as technically rational improvements.

## Advice

Magnepan speakers are optimal for users seeking soundstage expansion and openness that cannot be experienced with conventional box speakers. However, installation requires careful consideration, and proper amplifier selection is also important.

- **Audio beginners**: We recommend starting with the LRS+ (USD 1,200). Though compact, you can experience the characteristics of Magnepan's sound and clearly feel the difference from conventional speakers.
- **Intermediate and above**: Models MG 1.7i (USD 3,500) and above allow you to enjoy the more authentic appeal of planar magnetic types. An amplifier with sufficient driving power (minimum 100W or more) is required.
- **Large listening room owners**: The MG 2.7i (USD 6,500) and 2.7X (USD 7,333) provide a grand soundstage that cannot be experienced elsewhere.

It is important to always audition before purchase and confirm the compatibility of installation environment and amplifier. If you understand the acoustic characteristics specific to planar magnetic types and use them in an appropriate environment, they will provide a musical experience that cannot be obtained elsewhere.
