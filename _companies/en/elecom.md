summary: "A Japanese peripheral manufacturer founded in 1986, holding the top domestic market share for mice and keyboards. In the audio field, they primarily develop computer speakers and entry-class earphones, but with limited measurement performance and technological innovation. While they have launched products including LDAC-compatible wireless earphones, their competitive advantage is low compared to similar price range products, and they tend to lack technical depth compared to audio-specialized manufacturers."

## Overview

Elecom Co., Ltd. is a Japanese peripheral manufacturer founded in Osaka in 1986. Initially starting with computer desks and other office furniture, they introduced an elliptical mouse in 1988 that became the world standard design. Currently, they hold the number one market share in Japan for mice, keyboards, and speakers as a major corporation.

In the audio field, they handle computer speakers, headphones, and earphones. In 2025, they announced fully wireless earphones with LDAC support and active noise canceling functionality, following current market trends. In terms of design, they have won the Good Design Award more than 150 times and the iF Design Award 66 times from 1993 to 2019, earning high recognition for their appearance quality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The measurement performance of Elecom's audio products shows limited products reaching transparency levels. Reference Audio Analyzer measurements of the EHP-BS100 show THD+N at approximately 0.5% at 1kHz, remaining at average levels for headphones. Frequency response also shows variations of approximately ±5dB across 20Hz-20kHz, far from flat reproduction.

For the LDAC-compatible wireless earphones announced in 2025, while claiming hi-res support, verification through actual measurement data is insufficient, and scientifically-based sound quality improvement effects cannot be confirmed. Regarding the active noise canceling function, specific dB values for reduction effects are not published, making objective evaluation compared to industry standards difficult.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Elecom's technology level is below industry average. Most audio products use combinations of off-the-shelf driver units and DAC chips, with virtually no proprietary developed technologies visible. Even LDAC-compatible products only implement existing standards developed by Sony, with no confirmation of proprietary acoustic technologies or algorithm development.

The "Giant Size" speaker series adopts housing six times the size of normal earphones, but this is volume increase through physical enlargement and is evaluated as having low technological innovation. Passive radiator-equipped models are also within the scope of existing technology applications and cannot be considered leading-edge technologies in the industry.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

For enterprise review, we selected three representative products: wireless earphones (LDAC+ANC), Giant Size speaker, and entry-class headphones, as they cover main audio categories. Comparing Elecom's latest wireless earphones (around 67 USD) with the SoundPEATS Capsule3 Pro (47 USD) which has equivalent LDAC support and ANC functionality, CP = 47 USD ÷ 67 USD = 0.7. Comparing the Giant Size speaker SP-EL001CGD (27 USD) with the equivalent output Edifier R1280T (100 USD), since the Elecom product is cheaper with comparable performance, CP = 1.0. For entry-class headphones (around 33 USD), the equivalent performance Superlux HD668B (27 USD) exists, giving CP = 27 USD ÷ 33 USD = 0.8. The average CP of these products is (0.7 + 1.0 + 0.8) / 3 ≈ 0.83, rounded to 0.8. Overall evaluation shows moderate competitive advantage against competitors, though sound quality differentiation remains challenging.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As an established Japanese manufacturer, Elecom has built a stable support system. Since its founding in 1986, they have continuously expanded business and currently grown into a global company with overseas bases in Korea, Philippines, America, Netherlands, Germany, and China.

Product warranty is industry-standard one year, with prompt domestic repair and replacement response. Firmware update support is provided, but frequency and functional improvement content is limited compared to competitors. For long-term product support, they have a track record as a peripheral manufacturer, providing more confidence than audio-specialized manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Elecom's design philosophy is a practical approach emphasizing utility and price. In the audio field, they prioritize consumer-oriented ease of use and affordable pricing over advanced technical challenges. LDAC support and ANC functionality adoption are rational decisions responding to market trends.

However, their scientific approach to sound quality improvement is insufficient, with tendencies toward marketing-focused feature additions rather than measurable performance improvements. They adopt V-shaped acoustic characteristics and other tuning that appeals to general audiences, but may not be suitable for users seeking faithful music reproduction. While product development leveraging computer peripheral manufacturer expertise is commendable, the depth of audio specialization is limited.

## Advice

Elecom products are suitable for users who prioritize convenience and cost over audio quality. They provide sufficient performance particularly for desktop PC audio systems and entry-level wireless music experiences.

- **For PC Users**: The Giant Size speaker series is optimal for convenient sound quality improvement in desktop environments and is an excellent choice in the same price range.
- **Wireless Beginners**: LDAC-compatible earphones serve as introductory hi-res wireless devices that can satisfy users without excessive expectations.
- **Design-Conscious Users**: True to their Good Design Award winning track record, appearance quality is high and attractive to users who care about aesthetics.

However, for serious music listening or applications emphasizing sound quality, superior competing products exist in the same price range, so considering products from audio-specialized manufacturers is recommended.
