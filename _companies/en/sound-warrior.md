summary: "Japanese headphone brand making conventional dynamic-driver models with decent build. Technical innovation is limited, and lack of independent measurements constrains scientific assessment. Cost-performance is roughly average when compared with the cheapest measured studio alternatives."

## Overview

Sound Warrior is a Japanese audio brand of Shiroshita Industrial Co., Ltd., whose roots date to 1923 as a raw silk factory and which shifted to OEM/ODM audio in the 1960s. The brand makes closed-back wired headphones such as the SW-HP10/SW-HP20 series, emphasizing Japan assembly and practical designs. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, lab-grade measurements for Sound Warrior’s current headphones are sparse. Manufacturer specifications for the SW-HP20 list 40 Ω impedance, 10 Hz–35 kHz bandwidth, and 101 dB/1 mW sensitivity, but do not publish THD, crosstalk, or controlled frequency-response deviation data. We therefore treat scientific assessment as provisional pending third-party results. For context when judging CP equivalence, a popular comparator (Audio-Technica ATH-M40x) shows weighted harmonic distortion of 0.300 @ 90 dB SPL and overall passive isolation of −11.21 dB in independent tests, illustrating the data depth available on peers. [2][3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Sound Warrior relies on conventional 40 mm dynamic drivers in closed-back, wired designs. The SW-HP20 uses a nylon-resin housing and includes detachable cables, but there is no evidence of proprietary acoustical innovations, DSP, or ANC. The implementation is serviceable yet standard for the segment. [2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Price basis (EN uses USD):** SW-HP20 current market price converted to **113 USD** based on a stable Japan retail of **17,490円 (tax-in)**. Comparator: **Sennheiser HD 280 Pro (2016)** at **99.95 USD** from a major US retailer. **Equivalence note:** both are closed-back, wired, over-ear dynamic headphones; the HD 280 Pro has published low distortion (WHD 0.273 @ 90 dB) and typical passive isolation (overall −12.36 dB), meeting equal-or-better measured performance on key axes vs. the SW-HP20’s unverified metrics. **CP = 99.95 USD ÷ 113 USD = 0.885 → 0.9.** [2][3][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Shiroshita Industrial has long-running domestic manufacturing and OEM/ODM experience in Japan, which generally supports consistent build quality. As a smaller brand, global service footprint and parts availability may be narrower than large multinationals; no firmware considerations apply to these passive headphones. [1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The brand emphasizes straightforward, measurable design choices (closed-back dynamic drivers, detachable cables) and avoids pseudoscientific claims. However, the approach does not explicitly target transparent-level performance (e.g., documented FR linearity/THD/Isolation improvements), so rationality is solid but not leading.

## Advice

If you specifically want Japanese-assembled, no-nonsense wired closed-backs, Sound Warrior is a credible option. Given the absence of third-party data for current models, value shoppers should weigh alternatives with published measurements and strong availability, such as the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro (99.95 USD) or Audio-Technica ATH-M40x (109 USD). These deliver equivalent functions and documented performance at the same or lower price points. [3][4][5]
