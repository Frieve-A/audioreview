## Overview

Zonotone is a Japanese audio cable specialist manufacturer established in 2007 by Toshihiko Maezono. Based in Nerima, Tokyo, the company is operated by Maezono Sound Lab Co., Ltd. The company features ultra-high purity 7NCu (99.99999% purity) and other high-purity conductor materials, along with proprietary structural technology called DMHC (Duo or Discrete Multicore Helical Conductor). They offer product lines including speaker cables, interconnects, and digital cables. With multiple series including Shupreme, Grandio, Royal Spirit, and Granster, the company is said to have gained support from audiophiles in the Japanese domestic market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

From the perspective of scientific validity in audio cables, Zonotone's products are questionable. The impact on sound quality from the company's emphasized 99.99999% purity 7NCu conductor and various high-purity materials is extremely limited when considering audible thresholds. As long as cables use appropriate gauge and basic conductor materials (such as OFC) with resistance, inductance, and capacitance values within specification ranges, the auditory improvement effects from ultra-high purity materials have not been scientifically proven. The company's product technical specifications lack published objective measurement data such as frequency response, THD, and S/N ratio, with many explanations relying on subjective expressions like "clear highs" and "rich midrange". While the appropriate 14AWG gauge size is commendable, the sound quality improvement effects from material purity enhancement are judged to be at levels that cannot be confirmed through measurement.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Zonotone's technology level is evaluated as approximately industry average. Certain technical innovations are recognized, including the DMHC structure, conductor design combining multiple high-purity materials, and adoption of beryllium copper connectors. The adoption of Furukawa Electric's PCUHD (Pure Copper Ultra High Drawability) and Proterial's (formerly Hitachi Metals) HiFC high-performance pure copper wire can be evaluated as technical choices in material procurement. However, it remains unclear how much these technologies contribute to final measured performance. There are few technologies considered innovative in the cable field, with product development centered on combinations of existing technologies. Conductor structure and shielding technology remain at industry standard implementation levels, with no confirmed technical superiority worth noting.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Zonotone's cost-performance is extremely poor. Against the 6NSP-Granster 5500α pricing of 5,420 JPY per meter, Canare 4S11 with equivalent electrical characteristics is available for around 500 JPY. Since Zonotone's claimed sound quality improvement effects from ultra-high purity materials are not scientifically proven, users can achieve equivalent function and performance at less than one-tenth the price. Even general speaker cables using 14AWG OFC conductors can ensure sufficient performance in resistance, inductance, and capacitance, so no added value commensurate with the high pricing is recognized.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a company established in 2007 with 18 years of track record, certain continuity can be confirmed. With headquarters in Japan and products continuously sold through major domestic sales channels, basic business stability is recognized. However, specific information regarding warranty periods, repair systems, and technical support is scarce on their official website, and a support system comparable to major manufacturers cannot be expected due to its nature as a small, specialized manufacturer. Global support systems are limited, with business development primarily focused on the Japanese market.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Zonotone's design philosophy is based on a "Pure & Power & Reality" concept, which indicates a direction where "material purity takes priority over everything". This ideology prioritizes a specific belief over scientific and engineering rationality and is rated as highly unlikely to lead to measurable sound quality improvements. The excessive focus on ultra-high purity materials is an inefficient approach where effects commensurate with the cost cannot be expected. Product descriptions rely more on subjective sound quality expressions than objective performance evaluation, leading to the conclusion that the rationality of its design approach is exceptionally low. While basic specifications like the selection of an appropriate gauge size are sound, it is difficult to evaluate the overall philosophy as rational.

## Advice

While Zonotone products may be an option for users seeking the brand value of high-quality Japanese-made cables or who sympathize with its design philosophy, they cannot be recommended for purchasers prioritizing scientifically-viewed sound quality improvement or cost-performance. For those considering the company's 6NSP-Granster 5500α, industrial-grade cables like Canare 4S11 or Belden provide equivalent electrical performance at less than one-tenth the price. In cable selection, appropriate gauge selection according to length, connection reliability, and physical durability are important, and the rationality of investing high costs in material purity improvement is judged to be low. We strongly recommend directing limited budgets toward more effective audio equipment improvements, such as speakers or amplifiers.
