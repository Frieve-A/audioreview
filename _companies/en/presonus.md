## Overview

PreSonus is an American audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1995 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Since November 2021, it has operated as a subsidiary of Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC). The company handles a wide range of music production equipment including audio interfaces, monitor speakers, digital mixers, and Studio One DAW software, targeting a broad spectrum from professionals to home studio users. They have gained recognition particularly through their StudioLive series digital mixers and Eris series studio monitors.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While PreSonus products maintain basic audio quality, their measured performance remains at industry standard levels without reaching transparency thresholds. The flagship AudioBox USB 96 achieves frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (±3dB), THD+N under 0.008%, and SNR above 95dB, but falls short of transparent levels. The higher-end Quantum features an AK5574 ADC (theoretical THD+N -112dB) yet actual measured performance is -86dB (0.005%), showing significant degradation and indicating design implementation issues. Regarding Eris monitor speakers, the specialized measurement site Erin's Audio Corner has identified their "studio quality" claims as false, with confirmed severe frequency response irregularities showing 7-10dB mid-range dips.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Technically, PreSonus maintains industry average standards but shows limited uniqueness or advancement. Their audio interfaces utilize off-the-shelf chips from AKM (AK5574, AK4413) and Texas Instruments (PCM4202) with appropriate design but fail to fully exploit the theoretical performance of these chips. Studio One DAW software, despite a modest 3.8% market share, demonstrates certain technical progress by pioneering implementation of Splice integration and stem separation features in the 2024 version 7. However, overall product development centers on combining existing technologies, with no innovative technologies directly contributing to sound quality improvement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Cost-performance evaluation shows mixed results. The flagship AudioBox USB 96 (99 USD) offers functional advantages compared to the Focusrite Scarlett Solo (approximately 120 USD). The AudioBox provides two inputs versus Scarlett Solo's single input, plus MIDI I/O functionality, making it among the most affordable with equivalent features. However, upper-tier Quantum ES 4 (349 USD) level performance can be adequately substituted by MOTU M4 (220 USD), with 220 USD ÷ 349 USD = 0.63, indicating a moderately competitive position. Studio One DAW at approximately 169 USD is affordable and functionally provides equivalent features to more expensive DAWs (Pro Tools, Logic Pro, etc.), achieving excellent cost-performance for software.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Reliability and support systems face serious challenges. While warranty period follows industry standard of one year, customer reviews report severe issues including "no parts availability, circuit diagrams withheld," "support quality degradation after FMIC acquisition," and "communication inadequacies." Particularly problematic is the ULT series speakers situation where 6-year warranty is advertised while replacement parts inventory is unavailable. Conversely, cases of prompt repair response exist, indicating significant variability in support quality. Post-FMIC acquisition support system restructuring remains insufficient, creating high post-purchase risks.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Design philosophy is highly rational. The strategy of providing integrated product lines (hardware + software) covering the entire music production workflow directly enhances user convenience. Modern approaches include active utilization of digital technology in the StudioLive series, cost reduction through software integration, and emphasis on simplicity via USB connectivity. Cloud integration (Splice) and AI technology utilization in Studio One DAW represent contemporary directions. The existence rationale as dedicated hardware is justified through music production-specific functions difficult to achieve with general-purpose equipment. Despite implementation challenges, basic design principles are scientifically grounded with thorough elimination of occult elements.

## Advice

PreSonus excels in integration as a music production ecosystem and presents an attractive choice particularly for cost-performance-conscious users. Most recommendable is the Studio One DAW software, which despite modest market share offers excellent function-to-price ratio and pioneers innovative feature implementation. AudioBox USB 96 with dual inputs and MIDI I/O at 99 USD provides functional advantages over competitors, making it suitable for beginners to intermediate users. However, individual product technical refinement and support quality present challenges. The Eris speakers are strongly discouraged due to serious frequency response issues. Before purchase, it's crucial to verify current support system status and understand problem resolution systems within warranty periods. Overall, this represents a good choice for users prioritizing budget and integrated environments, but users prioritizing ultimate sound quality should conduct comparative evaluations with other manufacturers.
