## Overview

REQST Inc. (株式会社レクスト) was established in 2003, evolving from Resonance Chip Company founded in 1998, based in Hayama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. The company describes itself as "a development team pursuing better sound," with the name representing "Re: Reproduced Quality + ST: Supreme Quality" [1]. The company develops audio cables (power/line/digital), vibration dampening accessories including resonance chips, DA converters, speakers, and speaker stands [1]. Their new line cable Z-LNC01FE-el (general release August 27, 2025) is priced at 132 USD for 1m pair and 149 USD for 1.5m pair (approximately 137.95-155.37 USD range including tax) [2]. The company claims professional adoption in Grammy award productions and million-seller music works over 25 years of operation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The Z-LNC01FE-el RCA cable is priced at 132 USD for 1m pair and 149 USD for 1.5m pair (approximately 137.95-155.37 USD range including tax), positioning it as a high-priced audio cable claiming sound quality improvements [2]. The product page includes a specifications section listing product name, cable material, color, cable outer diameter, plug, country of origin, and price, but resistance/capacitance values or acoustic measurement data are not (at least publicly) provided on official product pages [2]. For the company's Resonance Chip Pierre (Pichip), an external measurement report by Southern Acoustics Corporation has been published, confirming vibration damping of headphone housing inherent sounds [3], but acoustic measurement data for the Z-LNC01FE-el cable itself is not provided. The company makes subjective claims about "superior sound quality" and professional studio adoption but provides no ABX blind test evidence or scientific validation for the Z-LNC01FE-el. For high-priced products that claim audible sound quality improvement without ABX blind test or equivalent evidence of audibility, Scientific Validity is set to 0.0. For the Z-LNC01FE-el, no objective measurement data exists (at least publicly on official product pages) to support claims of performance superiority over standard cables.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

REQST demonstrates established technical expertise through their 25+ year operating history, published audio books through Rittor Music, and operation of SACD-certified production studios until 2010 [1]. The company has developed in-house resonance chip technology since 1998, including collaborations such as the "Resonance Chip Pierre" launched in 2020. The technology level remains at industry standard without significant innovation beyond traditional vibration damping concepts.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The Z-LNC01FE-el is priced at 132 USD for 1m pair and 149 USD for 1.5m pair (approximately 137.95-155.37 USD range including tax) [2]. For basic analog audio transmission with equivalent functionality, standard RCA cables such as Amazon Basics RCA cable (approximately 10 USD) serve as comparison targets [6]. Equipped with standard connectivity functions, these provide equivalent-or-better functionality for basic analog audio transmission. While precise comparison is difficult due to unpublished resistance/capacitance values for the Z-LNC01FE-el, alternatives exist that provide equivalent-or-better performance for basic RCA cable functions. Using the lowest-priced 1m pair as the basis, CP = 10 USD ÷ 137.95 USD = 0.0725, which rounds to 0.1 to the first decimal place.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

REQST demonstrates strong reliability credentials through their 25+ year operating history since 1998, establishing credible longevity in the audio industry [1]. Simple cable construction provides inherent durability advantages due to fewer failure-prone components. The company offers responsive customer service with response within 2 business days during business hours (weekdays 10:00 AM–6:00 PM JST) [4]. Their established track record includes operation of professional studios and publication of educational materials, indicating sustained business competence. Special warranty services (including Pichip Special Warranty Service) are available for select products, demonstrating commitment to customer support [6].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

REQST's design philosophy for cables (Z-LNC01FE-el) emphasizes "superior sound quality" and professional adoption claims without providing scientific measurement data or controlled testing evidence [2]. The company charges premium prices for basic audio cables without demonstrating objective performance advantages over standard alternatives. Claims of audible effects lack scientific validation, contradicting established understanding of cable performance in typical audio applications. The approach represents cost investment in areas not proven to affect measured performance.

## Advice

REQST products may appeal to users seeking premium audio accessories with established brand heritage and professional associations. However, potential purchasers should understand that no scientific measurement data supports claims of superior performance over standard cables. For users prioritizing objective performance per dollar, equivalent functionality is available at significantly lower cost through standard RCA cables from mainstream manufacturers. The company's 25+ year track record provides confidence in build quality and customer support, though this does not validate acoustic performance claims.
