## Overview

Coral Audio Corporation was a Japanese loudspeaker manufacturer active through the 1970s–80s. The company specialized in drivers and speaker systems; a verified example is the BX-1001, a 10-inch 3-way, bass-reflex, bookshelf-sized (“standmount”) speaker with horn tweeter and wood-veneer cabinet. A 1971 brochure confirms published specifications and features for this model, including a 3-step tone selector and lattice-work grille [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Public, modern third-party measurement data for Coral systems are not available, so the score reflects uncertainty. For the BX-1001, Coral’s brochure states **35–25,000 Hz** frequency response and **102 dB/W** sensitivity, with a 10″ woofer, 4″ midrange, and horn tweeter (crossover at 2 kHz and 7 kHz) [1]. These are ambitious, period-typical claims, but they are not validated by contemporary standardized measurements. For context, a modern budget bookshelf like Polk’s Monitor **XT15** has published specs of **48–40,000 Hz** and **86 dB** sensitivity and also has independent Klippel NFS data available from a third party [2][3]. Given the absence of verified third-party data for Coral, we cannot assess linearity, directivity, distortion, or compression to current transparent standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Coral’s offerings embodied competent, conventional loudspeaker technology of their era: paper-cone woofers, a horn tweeter for efficiency, passive crossovers, plywood/MDF cabinetry, and user tone switches. The BX-1001 brochure illustrates these approaches (e.g., lattice grille, horn tweeter, 3-step tone selector) [1]. These choices prioritized sensitivity and practicality over the measurement-driven optimization common today.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Typical used-market pricing for BX-1001 pairs falls roughly **70–250 USD**, with numerous recent sold examples near the middle of that range [4]. As a measured modern baseline, the **Polk Monitor XT15** lists at **179 USD/pair** on the official site [3] and has independent measurement data [2]. Using a representative used price of **150 USD/pair** for the BX-1001 yields a cost-performance ratio of **150 ÷ 179 = 0.84**; at a lower observed price of **93 USD/pair** the ratio is **0.52**. Given this spread, vintage Coral can offer reasonable value where a buyer accepts restoration risk and unknown performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Coral is defunct; there is no manufacturer warranty, official parts, or support. Ownership entails restoration and third-party servicing, with potential parts scarcity. While passive speaker construction can be robust, the absence of support infrastructure drives the score to the minimum.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design emphasis favored high efficiency (e.g., horn tweeter) and user-adjustable voicing (tone selector), consistent with 1970s practices. Without modern, transparent measurements to guide revisions, the approach appears conventional rather than measurement-optimized.

## Advice

Coral speakers (e.g., BX-1001) are appealing to vintage enthusiasts seeking period aesthetics and high sensitivity at accessible used prices. Buyers prioritizing **measured** performance, predictable QC, and warranty should consider modern, measured alternatives such as the Polk Monitor XT15, which provides current engineering, published specs, and third-party data [2][3]. Vintage Coral suits collectors and hobbyists willing to restore and experiment more than users seeking verified accuracy and support.
