summary: "A German giant at the forefront of audio technology for over 75 years. Building on its absolute trust in the professional market, it has recently further strengthened its consumer business through collaboration with hearing aid giant Sonova. From traditional high-quality headphones to hearable devices that clarify conversations, its domain continues to expand. The price is by no means cheap, but for long-term use, its value is irreplaceable."

## Overview

A veteran German audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1945. Centered on microphones and headphones, it has garnered immense support from professional studios to general audiophiles worldwide. Open-back headphones like the HD 600 and HD 800 series, in particular, have reigned as reference-grade equipment for many years.

A major turning point came in 2021 when the consumer business (headphones, soundbars, etc.) was licensed to Sonova Holding AG, a leading company in the hearing aid industry. This has led to the fusion of Sennheiser's traditional audio technology with Sonova's advanced hearing technology, resulting in innovative products like the `Conversation Clear Plus`.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Sennheiser has traditionally emphasized objective performance based on measurement data, not just subjective "good sound." The `Conversation Clear Plus` hearable device, born from the collaboration with Sonova, symbolizes this stance. It solves the clear objective of improving speech intelligibility in noisy environments through a scientific approach, using beamforming microphones and speech enhancement algorithms, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated by independent studies. Furthermore, the flagship HD 800 S addressed the high-frequency peak pointed out in its predecessor, the HD 800, by absorbing and flattening it with a proprietary "absorber technology" applying the principle of Helmholtz resonance, achieving a more natural and easy-to-listen-to sound. This is worthy of high praise for the company's scientific development approach that does not end audio as a matter of mere perception.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Sennheiser maintains an industry-leading level of technology. The transducer design and manufacturing technology cultivated over many years is the backbone supporting the performance and reliability of a wide range of products, from high-end models like the HD 800 S to the workhorse HD 25 used in professional settings. Recently, the company has shown a vigorous appetite for development, releasing the `HD 490 PRO` with a completely new driver for music producers, refusing to rest on its existing technology. In consumer wireless headphones like the `Momentum 4 Wireless`, which incorporates Sonova's technology, it achieves both top-class sound quality and an astonishing 60-hour battery life, making its technology portfolio surpass that of other specialized audio manufacturers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Drop HD6XX (USD 199) has equivalent measurement performance to the HD 650 (USD 275), so CP = USD 199 รท USD 275 = 0.72. Audeze LCD-X (USD 1,199) has equivalent THD+N performance to the HD 800S (USD 1,380), so CP = USD 1,199 รท USD 1,380 = 0.87. Sony MDR-7506 (USD 89) has equivalent measurement performance to the HD 25 (USD 125), so CP = USD 89 รท USD 125 = 0.71.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The fact that their equipment has been used in professional settings for many years speaks volumes about its high reliability. The HD 25, a landmark in DJ headphones, is even called a "tank" for its overwhelming durability and design that allows users to easily replace parts themselves. For many models, consumables like earpads and cables are supplied for a long time, and the support system that enables the long-term use of a single product is a model for the industry.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company's product design is extremely rational, thoroughly eliminating unscientific elements (so-called "occult" audio). The purpose of each product is clear: professional monitor headphones for uncolored, accurate sound reproduction; consumer high-end models for reproducing a vast soundstage; and hearable devices for improving convenience in specific situations. To achieve these goals, optimal designs based on acoustic engineering are employed, resulting in a minimalist, functional beauty.

## Advice

Sennheiser products are not for users looking for "cheap and good." However, for users who want to "buy something truly good, even if it's expensive, and use it for a long time," it is the most reliable choice.

- **For Audio Beginners to Intermediates**: First, consider the HD 600 series (especially the HD 660S2). By using the sound of this series as a standard, you can learn one of the benchmarks for "good sound" in the audio world. If you want easy wireless, the `Momentum 4 Wireless` will be a satisfying choice in terms of both sound quality and functionality.
- **For Music Producers & Professionals**: Depending on the application, the HD 25, HD 600, and HD 490 PRO are standard choices. The fact that many of your peers use them guarantees their performance.
- **For Those Who Have Difficulty in Noisy Conversations**: The `Conversation Clear Plus` can be the optimal solution if you want to improve listening clarity but are hesitant about hearing aids.

Whichever product you choose, purchasing a Sennheiser product is an investment in its outstanding audio technology and German craftsmanship.
