## Overview

Nmode is the primary brand of Lyric Corp., a Japanese audio equipment manufacturer founded in May 2008 and based in Fukuoka, Japan [1]. The company specializes in audio amplifiers and Digital-to-Analog Converters utilizing proprietary 1-bit audio technology. Founded by Tsuneo Nunomura, who previously worked on Sharp Corporation's 1-bit audio project team from 1999, Nmode represents a continuation of legitimate 1-bit audio development heritage [1]. The company's representative product, the X-PM7 MK2 1-bit integrated amplifier, is priced at 2,208 USD [2]. Nmode positions itself as creating "feeling reproduction machines" focused on recreating emotional musical experiences, particularly inspired by vinyl record listening [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Available manufacturer specifications for the X-PM7 MK2 demonstrate excellent harmonic distortion performance at 0.005% (1kHz, 1W output), significantly exceeding the transparent threshold of 0.01% [2]. Frequency response extends exceptionally wide from 5Hz to 90kHz, far beyond the standard 20Hz-20kHz range [2]. However, critical measurements including S/N ratio, dynamic range, and crosstalk are unavailable from manufacturer specifications, preventing comprehensive performance evaluation. The company's 1-bit audio technology operates at sampling rates up to 24.576 MHz with claimed time resolution advantages [2]. Per evaluation framework guidelines, conservative scoring applied due to reliance on manufacturer specifications rather than independent third-party measurements, with 0.1 adjustment toward baseline applied.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Nmode demonstrates solid technical competency through legitimate 1-bit audio heritage derived from Sharp Corporation's pioneering development work [1]. The company employs proprietary patent technology and maintains in-house design capabilities with specialized expertise accumulated since 1999 [1]. Their approach incorporates custom thin-film polymer capacitors, large R-core transformers, and redesigned amplification circuits optimized for 1-bit signal processing [2]. However, 1-bit audio represents a niche technological approach with limited industry adoption compared to mainstream amplifier technologies. While technically sophisticated, the technology lacks broad market desirability and primarily serves specialized applications rather than advancing toward industry-standard solutions.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The X-PM7 MK2 priced at 2,208 USD represents the world's cheapest integrated amplifier with equivalent user-facing functionality. Key features requiring functional equivalence include 2x XLR inputs for professional balanced connections and external clock input (BNC connector) supporting multiple sampling frequencies (5.6448, 6.144, 11.2896, 12.288, 22.5792, 24.576 MHz) for high-precision timing synchronization [2]. Investigation of current market reveals no cheaper alternatives providing this combination of XLR inputs and external clock functionality. While products like NAD C 316BEE V2 (499 USD) and Yamaha A-S501 (599.95 USD) offer higher power output, they lack essential professional features (XLR inputs and external clock capability) that define the X-PM7 MK2's target application. The absence of cheaper alternatives with equivalent professional functionality establishes CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Nmode provides standard manufacturer support through their dedicated Fukuoka service center with established repair infrastructure and business hours 10:00-18:00 weekdays [6]. The company has operated since 2008 with reasonable operational history but limited global support presence. Support infrastructure remains primarily Japan-focused with limited international service capabilities. Standard warranty coverage is provided with included accessories (manual, warranty card, power cord, remote control) [2]. No specific reliability data or failure rate information is publicly available. Construction quality appears standard for audio amplifiers without particular reliability advantages or concerns identified.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Nmode's design philosophy combines legitimate technical foundation in 1-bit audio with subjective emphasis on "feeling reproduction" and emotional musical experience [3]. While the 1-bit technology has technical merit derived from established Sharp Corporation development, the company emphasizes unmeasurable subjective qualities without ABX blind test evidence of audible superiority. Claims of superior "time resolution 450 times that of CD" and "multi-bit smoothness" lack scientific verification of audible benefits [2]. The significant cost premium relative to measurable performance improvements indicates limited cost-effectiveness. The approach represents conservative analog-focused methodology rather than integration of cutting-edge digital technologies. Design philosophy prioritizes subjective audio mythology over measurement-verified improvements, resulting in expensive products without demonstrable audible advantages over lower-cost alternatives.

## Advice

For potential purchasers seeking high-fidelity amplification with professional features, Nmode represents the most cost-effective option for the specific combination of XLR inputs and external clock synchronization capabilities. The X-PM7 MK2's 2,208 USD price point provides unique functionality unavailable in cheaper alternatives. Buyers specifically interested in 1-bit audio technology and professional connectivity may appreciate Nmode's specialized approach, though should carefully consider whether subjective claims beyond measured performance provide additional value. The company's Japan-focused support structure may limit service accessibility for international customers. For users not requiring XLR inputs or external clock functionality, alternatives like NAD, Yamaha, or Topping amplifiers provide excellent measured performance at significantly lower costs with higher power output.
