## Overview

Primare is a Swedish audio company based in southern Sweden with nearly forty years of hi-fi design history. The brand emphasizes Scandinavian principles such as balance and simplicity and a modular product architecture that allows DAC/streaming upgrades. Lineups include integrated amplifiers, DACs, and streaming components using UFPD (Ultra Fast Power Device) Class-D amplification and the Prisma network platform [1][2][8][9].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent lab data exist for Primare’s I35 series. Hi-Fi News measured the I35’s **continuous power at 190W/8Ω and 395W/4Ω**, dynamic output up to **510W/2Ω**, a **frequency response within −0.02 to −0.18dB (20Hz–20kHz)**, and an **A-weighted S/N of ~79.8dB (0dBW)**; load-invariance of the UFPD2 stage was also documented [3]. For a mainstream comparator used in CP below, Cambridge Audio’s Evo 150 earned bench praise for **low noise/distortion and load-invariant behavior** on Audioholics’ DeLorean bench test [6]. Where only catalog specs are available (e.g., supported formats, platform features), these are treated as provisional manufacturer claims and clearly cited [2][5].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Primare’s UFPD2 Class-D implementation is contemporary and aims for load-invariant response; the company’s modular concept (analog-only base with optional DAC and Prisma network modules) is sensible system design [2][3]. However, competitors adopt similarly advanced modules (e.g., Hypex Ncore in Evo 150) with equal or better measured transparency, so the overall technical sophistication is solid but not cutting-edge for 2025 [5][6].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (functions + measurements):** Cambridge Audio **Evo 150**—integrated streamer-amp with **150W/8Ω**, MM phono, HDMI ARC, and modern streaming platform; third-party bench shows excellent noise/distortion and load behavior [5][6].  
**Review target price (I35 Prisma DM36):** **5,999 USD** (authorized US retailer) [4].  
**Comparator price:** **3,299 USD** (official US store) [5].

**Calculation:** 3,299 USD ÷ 5,999 USD = **0.55** → rounded to **0.5**.  
**Equivalence note:** Evo 150 provides built-in DAC/streaming, 150W/8Ω power, and bench-verified low noise/distortion; these meet or exceed user-facing functions and core measured transparency of the I35 Prisma DM36 package [3][5][6].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Primare has multi-year continuity and offers standard warranty coverage via authorized dealers; Prisma receives ongoing firmware/OTA updates (release notes through 2025), suggesting active platform support [7][8]. As a smaller manufacturer, service network breadth is inherently narrower than mass brands, and proprietary modules may raise repair costs [2][7][8].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing transparent Class-D amplification and modular upgrades aligns with measurement-first fidelity goals. Prisma integrates common streaming transports and multi-room features in a unified control app. The approach is rational, but price positioning versus equally transparent alternatives reduces overall consumer value rationale [2][3][5][6][8].

## Advice

Primare’s integrateds are cleanly engineered, aesthetically refined, and measurably competent. If you value the brand’s industrial design and modularity, I35 Prisma DM36 is a capable hub. However, if your priority is **transparent performance per dollar**, products like **Evo 150** deliver equivalent functions and bench-validated transparency at materially lower price; reallocating savings to speakers or room treatment will usually yield greater audible benefit [3][5][6][8].
