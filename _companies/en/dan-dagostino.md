## Overview

Dan D'Agostino Master Audio Systems is an American high-end audio manufacturer founded in 2009 by Dan D'Agostino, the former founder of Krell. Based in Cave Creek, Arizona, the company specializes in handcrafted amplifiers, preamplifiers, and integrated amplifiers. The company's products are known for extremely high pricing, with the Relentless preamplifier selling for 149,500 USD. With the founder's technical reputation and track record at Krell, the brand has gained high recognition among audio enthusiasts.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Verification of measurement data from the company's flagship Progression integrated amplifier shows intermediate level performance. It achieves a THD+N value of 0.015% (at 200W/8Ω) and S/N ratio of 95dB (unweighted). The frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz±0.01dB is excellent, but THD and S/N do not reach transparent levels. The achievement of 0.02% open-loop distortion despite using a non-feedback design is commendable, but compared to modern Class D amplifiers, there are areas where THD performance and S/N ratio are inferior, resulting in moderate fidelity in the audible range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The company realizes classic high-end amplifier design techniques at a certain level, including discrete component full-balanced circuits and direct-coupled design. Technical capability is recognized in physical design aspects such as using 28 high-speed, high-output transistors and optimizing heat conduction to copper heat sinks. The achievement of open-loop bandwidth exceeding 75kHz despite non-feedback design is commendable. However, utilization of modern Class D technology or digital signal processing is not observed, and the technical approach is conservative. By contemporary standards, it must be evaluated as average technical level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Products with equal or superior performance to the Progression integrated amplifier (20,950 USD) include the combination of SMSL DL200 DAC/preamplifier (199 USD) and VTV Amplifier Purifi 1ET400A Stereo power amplifier (449 USD). This combination totals 648 USD and achieves THD<0.00008%, S/N ratio>129dB+>130dB, output 227W/8Ω, significantly surpassing Dan D'Agostino products. Calculation: 648 USD ÷ 20,950 USD = 0.031, resulting in extremely low cost-performance. The company's products have approximately 32x pricing relative to technical quality, which cannot be considered rational pricing.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While quality control is presumably thorough due to handcrafted production in the United States, there are constraints due to being a small-scale manufacturer. Warranty periods and specific failure rate data are not publicly available, making objective evaluation of reliability difficult. Clear information about support systems in Japan is also not available. While presumably having standard warranty and support systems for high-end products, it must be evaluated as below industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The company adopts classic approaches favored by some audio enthusiasts, such as non-feedback design and discrete construction, but there are significant questions about scientific rationality. Despite the existence of modern Class D technology and digital signal processing that can achieve equal or superior measurement performance at lower cost, they persist with high-cost classical methods. Particularly considering price-to-performance ratio, the rationality of design philosophy must be considered extremely low. The sonic superiority of non-feedback design is not confirmed in measurements, making cost increase justification difficult.

## Advice

While Dan D'Agostino Master Audio Systems products demonstrate intermediate level measurement performance, they cannot be recommended from a cost-performance perspective. Equal or superior performance to the company's Progression integrated amplifier can be achieved with SMSL's DL200 + VTV Purifi combination at approximately one-32nd the price. For those seeking sound quality improvement, numerous more rational choices exist. While different for those who value brand prestige or ownership satisfaction as crafted objects, for audio enthusiasts purely pursuing sound quality, we recommend modern products with balanced measurement performance and pricing. Sound quality improvement effects commensurate with high investment cannot be expected.
