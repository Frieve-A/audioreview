## Overview

Arendal Sound is a Norwegian speaker manufacturer established in 2015. The company specializes in the design and manufacturing of high-performance speakers, with the 1723 series achieving THX Ultra certification. By adopting a direct-to-consumer model, they eliminate intermediaries and maintain full control over all processes from manufacturing to customer support. Their main products are the 1723 series and the latest flagship 1528 series, aimed at reproducing cinema-level acoustic performance in home environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Arendal Sound's products demonstrate excellent measured performance. The 1723 subwoofers maintain 1-2% THD down to below 20Hz, achieving extremely clean output in the audible range. The new 1528 series shows distortion levels reduced by half compared to the already excellent 1723 series, with technical progress confirmed through measurements. THX Ultra certification for the 1723 series scientifically guarantees reproduction capability at reference levels in rooms up to 3000 cubic feet. Frequency response is properly controlled through anechoic chamber measurements, ensuring linearity of power response.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company employs advanced material technology and design methods. The 1528 series uses 28mm lithium-magnesium tweeters and carbon-graphene midrange drivers, with 8-inch aluminum cones featuring prism pattern ribs for rigidity enhancement. WaveGuide technology optimizes acoustic dispersion, while HDF cabinets suppress resonance - all acoustically meaningful technical implementations. The 1528 series evolved from 2-way to 3-way design with more sophisticated crossover design and dedicated midrange drivers, achieving significant measured performance improvements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 1723 Monitor THX is priced at 2499 USD per pair, but when comparing acoustic performance, the KEF LS50 Meta (1599 USD per pair) provides equivalent or superior performance in terms of frequency response flatness and lower distortion. Calculation: 1599 USD รท 2499 USD = 0.64. While the pricing is reasonable considering the high power handling, more affordable alternatives exist for users prioritizing sound quality alone. The flagship 1528 Tower 8 at 9500 USD per pair positions itself in the high-price segment where many competing products exist, limiting cost-performance advantages.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The company offers a 10-year warranty exceeding industry standards, demonstrating confidence in their products. The direct-to-consumer model enables integrated management from manufacturing to shipping and after-sales service, eliminating quality degradation risks from intermediaries. Free shipping and returns are provided in Europe and the US with established customer support systems. However, as a relatively new company established in 2015, long-term reliability has limited established track record. While Norway's status as a technologically advanced nation suggests certain quality standards, the experience gap compared to industry veterans cannot be denied.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Arendal Sound's design philosophy is extremely rational. Adherence to objective THX certification standards for the 1723 series, performance improvements based on measurement data, and scientifically justified material selection all contribute to measurable sound quality improvements. Price optimization through direct sales, frequency response optimization via anechoic measurements, and continuous distortion improvements demonstrate a rational approach that eliminates unscientific claims prevalent in the audio industry. The adoption of 3-way design in the 1528 series is based on clear objectives of measured performance improvement, with technological progress materialized as concrete performance gains. An engineering-focused rather than marketing-focused corporate stance is consistently reflected across all products.

## Advice

Arendal Sound is an optimal choice for users who prioritize scientific approach and measured performance. Particularly for home theater applications emphasizing THX standard reproduction, the 1723 series offers unparalleled value. However, for pure music listening, more affordable alternatives with equivalent acoustic performance exist, such as KEF LS50 Meta or Revel M106. The 1528 series represents the pinnacle of latest technology but requires careful cost-benefit consideration due to significantly higher pricing. Limited audition opportunities due to the direct-sales model should also be considered. While purchase risks are mitigated by 10-year warranty and return policies, users who value traditional audio dealer support may find this unsuitable. This manufacturer is strongly recommended for users seeking scientifically-based sound quality improvements and prioritizing THX standard movie reproduction.
