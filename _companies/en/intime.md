## Overview

Intime Acoustic is a Japanese audio brand owned by **O2aid Co., Ltd. (O2aid)**, founded in 2016 in Takasaki, Japan. The brand was established by **Yoshiyuki Watanabe** and leverages long-standing expertise in piezoelectric materials to deliver high-quality sound at accessible prices. Manufacturing is based in China with final quality control performed in Japan.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications list 20–40kHz ranges for SORA models and up to 50kHz for Miyabi, with 22Ω impedance and around 100–106dB sensitivity[1][3][6]. However, independent datasets for THD, SNR, IMD, and crosstalk remain limited. Third-party frequency-response data exist for selected models (e.g., Crinacle, Banbeu)[4][8], but coverage is incomplete. Following the unknown-measurement rule, we assign a provisional **0.5**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Intime’s proprietary **VST (Vertical Support Tweeter)** integrates a ceramic super-tweeter with a 10mm dynamic driver in a coaxial, hybrid architecture. Iterative generations (e.g., VST2) and the use of licensed **HDSS** technology from TBI Audio Systems to manage internal acoustics reflect meaningful engineering effort.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The SORA-2 retails at **USD 79**[6]. Without restricting by topology, we select the **cheapest non-inferior** comparator by **features and measured performance**: **7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2**, which includes a detachable 0.78mm 2-pin cable and shows strong frequency-response linearity with low distortion in independent testing. Its official price is **USD 24.99**[5], and Audio Science Review provides detailed measurements corroborating its objective performance[9]. Frequency-response data for Intime SORA/SORA-2 are available for cross-checking[4][8].  
**CP = 24.99 ÷ 79 = 0.316 → 0.3 (rounded).**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a relatively young, small operation, warranty handling is generally **via the retailer with a warranty card and proof of purchase**[7]. Distribution relies on regional dealers (e.g., LP Gear in the US; AccessoryJack in Hong Kong), and a centralized worldwide support scheme is limited. Production in China with final QC in Japan is a thoughtful setup; earlier brass-housing runs (e.g., initial Miyabi) raised long-term discoloration concerns, with later models moving to **titanium housings**, indicating ongoing quality iteration.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design direction coherently targets extended treble and clean staging via VST and simple coaxial layouts, with HDSS mitigating internal acoustic issues. Still, the shortage of comprehensive third-party measurements tempers the score.

## Advice

Intime suits listeners curious about hybrid ceramic tweeters and proprietary implementations. Before purchase, confirm local warranty handling (retailer) and compare price/performance against strong alternatives (e.g., hybrid or single-DD models) within your budget.
