## Overview

Established in 1984 in Oregon, USA, Audio Precision is the leading company in audio measurement equipment. The company's audio analyzers serve as the de facto standard in research and development (R&D) and manufacturing quality control (QC) for all audio products worldwide—from smartphones, headphones, amplifiers, and DACs to professional audio equipment.

Audio Precision (AP) contributes to the technical advancement and quality improvement of the entire audio industry by providing high-precision measurement solutions for evaluating product performance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Audio Precision's very existence embodies and supports the concept of "scientific validity" in the audio industry. Other manufacturers can present their products' frequency response, distortion rates (THD+N), and S/N ratios as "objective data" only because AP's analyzers provide a reliable measurement standard.

Flagship models like the APx555 B Series boast remarkable precision with residual THD+N noise below -120dB, challenging the measurement limits of even today's highest-performance audio equipment. This establishes the foundation for the entire industry to practice the fundamental scientific principle of product development based on reproducible and verifiable data rather than subjective impressions.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

AP's technology level stands at the pinnacle of the measurement equipment industry. Audio measurement presents unique challenges requiring extremely high precision across a wide bandwidth from 20Hz to beyond 20kHz (actually exceeding 1MHz), handling signals from microvolt-level to hundreds of volts across a dynamic range exceeding 170dB.

AP's analyzers meet these demands by condensing low-noise analog circuit technology, high-precision A/D and D/A converters, and sophisticated digital signal processing technology (FPGA) into a single chassis. Furthermore, models like the APx17B integrate multiple functions—analyzer, power amplifier, headphone amplifier, and microphone preamplifier—providing simple yet highly reliable one-box solutions for complex measurement systems. Software commonality across all models enables seamless data integration from R&D to manufacturing lines, maintaining the highest technology level as a complete system.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The APx500 series costs over 6,700 USD (1 million yen) for entry models, with flagship APx555 B reaching several million yen—extremely high in absolute terms. However, this price represents more than mere hardware costs. This is an "investment" in ensuring world-standard precision for audio product performance, streamlining development processes, and guaranteeing final product quality and market credibility.

While expensive compared to competitors, considering the overwhelming performance, reliability, and universal data value from industry-standard status, the cost-performance is sufficiently high for professional audio development environments.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The fact that virtually all major audio manufacturers, IT companies (smartphone manufacturers), and third-party evaluation institutions (including review sites) worldwide have adopted AP measurement equipment eloquently demonstrates its reliability. Once installed, equipment operates stably for extended periods, with regular calibration services guaranteeing precision. This unwavering reliability enables AP measurement data to function as a "common language" transcending national and corporate boundaries.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

All design decisions are unified under the single purpose of "measuring audio performance as accurately and efficiently as possible." Hardware features modular design allowing flexible combination of required functions (analog, digital, Bluetooth, HDMI, etc.). APx500 software supports complete test automation through sequence mode, ensuring reproducible results regardless of operator.

There is no room for subjective audio theories or unscientific elements—everything is designed based on rational metrics of measurement accuracy, reliability, and efficiency.

## Advice

Audio Precision products are not for general consumer purchase. These are professional tools for those who "create" and "evaluate" audio products.

- **Audio Product Developers**: AP analyzers are essential investments for objectively evaluating product performance, benchmarking against competitors, and achieving design goals. From R&D to manufacturing quality control, AP forms the foundation ensuring your product quality.
- **Audio Product Reviewers**: Providing objective performance measurement data alongside subjective impressions dramatically enhances review credibility and persuasiveness. Software-based solutions like APx500 Flex offer relatively accessible entry into industry-standard measurement.

Audio Precision defines the very "language" we use to discuss audio product performance. Without their existence, an objective and healthy audio market could not exist.
