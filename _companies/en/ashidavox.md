## Overview

ashidavox is the brand name of Ashida Ongaku Corporation, a Japanese audio equipment manufacturer established in 1942 with over 80 years of history. The company specializes in professional audio equipment used in harsh environments such as construction sites and broadcasting stations, including professional headsets, earphones for security and disaster prevention services, and acoustic signal speakers for visually impaired individuals. In recent years, they have also engaged in ODM/OEM production for domestic audio manufacturers, featuring robust designs that emphasize domestic production. While they offer consumer products like the ST-90-07 headphones, their product lineup is limited.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

When examining the published specifications of their flagship ST-90-07 headphones (5-40,000Hz, 108dB/mW, 40Ω), the 5Hz ultra-low frequency and 40kHz ultra-high frequency far exceed human audible range, making these scientifically meaningless measurements. Crucially important measurement data that determines sound quality, such as THD (Total Harmonic Distortion), SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and crosstalk, are not disclosed at all, making objective sound quality evaluation impossible. The 108dB/mW sensitivity is within standard range, and the 40mm dynamic driver configuration is also conventional. While professional equipment shows durability-focused design, scientifically-based sound quality improvement effects cannot be confirmed.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Technically, they employ a standard combination of 40mm dynamic drivers and OFC (Oxygen-Free Copper) cables, which is common in the industry. While OFC cables are effective as a basic quality improvement measure, they cannot be considered particularly advanced technology. Professional equipment shows some technological accumulation based on 80 years of experience in robust design, but no acoustic engineering innovations or proprietary technology development can be confirmed. Recent ODM/OEM production achievements demonstrate manufacturing capabilities, but commitment to proprietary advanced technology development is limited. Overall, the technology level remains at industry average standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The ST-90-07 headphones are sold for 9,020 yen, and we compared them with equivalent specification competitors. For products with 40mm dynamic drivers, impedance around 40Ω, and sensitivity over 100dB, we found the Superlux HD681 (3,000 yen) as the cheapest equivalent. Calculation: 3,000 yen ÷ 9,020 yen = 0.33, resulting in a score of 0.3. Equivalent products with similar functionality and measurement performance are available at lower prices, reducing cost-performance. Professional equipment is specialized for highly specific applications and includes products with functions difficult to substitute with generic alternatives, but consumer products show lower value in this regard.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

With business continuity since establishment in 1942 for over 80 years, corporate reliability can be rated highly. In the professional audio equipment market, they have long supplied products used in harsh environments such as construction sites, broadcasting stations, and security services, earning strong trust for durability. Their commitment to domestic production suggests an established quality control system. However, information about consumer product support systems is limited, and compared to major manufacturers, the adequacy of repair systems and after-sales services remains unclear. Due to their business focus on professional equipment, consumer support systems may still be developing.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While their basic policy of specializing in professional audio equipment is rational, there are concerns about the design philosophy for consumer products. The ST-90-07's 5-40,000Hz specification display presents values far exceeding human audible range, which can only be described as marketing-oriented specification display without scientific basis. For genuine sound quality improvement, performance enhancement within the audible range and disclosure of important indicators like THD and SNR are necessary. While professional equipment shows practical, solid design, consumer products exhibit design philosophy dependent on mythical elements for some audio enthusiasts (ultra-wide bandwidth display, OFC cable emphasis, etc.). The impression is that marketing approaches are prioritized over scientific approaches.

## Advice

ashidavox is a reliable audio equipment manufacturer with 80 years of history, and it's important to clarify your intended use when considering a purchase. For professional applications, the company's extensive experience and durability-focused design will be valuable, making it an appropriate choice. For general music listening headphones, the ST-90-07 at 9,020 yen is more expensive than equivalent products like the Superlux HD681 (3,000 yen), resulting in lower cost-performance. While there is added value from domestic production quality and the brand's historical value, those seeking better value should compare with cheaper alternatives that offer similar specifications. However, for those seeking scientific sound quality improvement, the insufficient disclosure of measurement data remains a challenge. By comparing with products from other companies that provide transparent data disclosure, more appropriate choices become possible.
