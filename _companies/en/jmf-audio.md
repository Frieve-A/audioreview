## Overview

JMF Audio, established in France in 1985 by Jean-Marie Fusilier, specializes in precision power amplifiers with over 35 years of manufacturing experience. Currently operated by founder's sons Laurent and Arnaud, both university-trained electrical and mechanical engineers, the company produces three main power amplifier models: the stereo HQS 6002, HQS 7001 monoblocks, and reference HQS 9001 monoblocks. All models feature dual-mono architecture with Class A/B linear amplification, targeting the ultra-high-end market segment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JMF Audio amplifiers demonstrate consistently transparent measured performance across all key parameters. The HQS 6002 achieves 0.01% THD+N at 250W/4Ω with 110dB SNR, while the flagship HQS 9001 reaches 0.005% THD+N with >110dB SNR and -125dB noise floor [1]. Frequency response measurements show ±0.1dB deviation from 3Hz-20kHz, significantly exceeding transparent level requirements. Third-party Stereophile measurements of the HQS 7001 confirm 114dB SNR performance [2]. All models consistently achieve or exceed transparent thresholds for THD, SNR, and frequency linearity without any measurements falling into problematic territory.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

JMF Audio employs solid traditional Class A/B linear amplifier design with proprietary elements including RPS power supply concept using custom French-manufactured toroidal transformers and capacitors, plus MTP high damping factor implementation [3]. Construction features selected high-frequency precision transistors, matched differential pairs, and completely handcrafted assembly with hand-soldering. However, the technology remains fundamentally mature analog approaches without integration of modern digital technologies, advanced Class D efficiency improvements, or cutting-edge functional integration that would be difficult for competitors to replicate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

JMF Audio exhibits extremely poor cost-performance across all models. The HQS 6002 (current market price 45,000 USD) [8] provides dual-mono stereo power amplifier functions equivalent to the NAD Masters M23 V2 at 4,999 USD [4]. The NAD M23 V2 offers comparable power output (200W/8Ω, 380W/4Ω vs 220W/8Ω, 400W/4Ω) with Purifi Eigentakt technology delivering immeasurably low harmonic and intermodulation distortion at all frequencies and output levels. Both provide balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA inputs, dual-mono architecture, high current capability for demanding loads, professional-grade stereo amplification, and full-range power delivery without DSP limitations, making the NAD equivalent-or-better in essential user-facing functions. CP = 4,999 USD ÷ 45,000 USD = 0.111. The Benchmark AHB2 at 3,499 USD provides clearly superior measured performance with 0.00013% THD at full power, 132dB dynamic range, and -131dB 3rd harmonic distortion [7], demonstrating that equivalent or superior measured performance is available at significantly lower pricing.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JMF Audio provides up to 5-year international limited warranty coverage, exceeding typical industry standards of 2-3 years [5]. The simple analog linear architecture offers inherent robustness with fewer failure-prone components compared to complex digital designs. Each unit undergoes 100-hour minimum burn-in period with eight-point manual calibration before shipment. The company's 35+ year operational history and established dealer-based support network through authorized retailers provides reasonable confidence in long-term parts availability and service continuity.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

JMF Audio's design philosophy demonstrates significant irrationality from scientific perspective. The company explicitly states that "only a few parameters are measurable with traditional methods" while emphasizing subjective listening validation over measurement science [6]. Their approach involves "a subtle convergence of scientific rigor, evaluations by listening and craftsman's work of art" but prioritizes unmeasurable "musicality and expression" over objective measurement approaches [6]. The majority of product pricing appears unrelated to measurable performance improvements, with boutique handcrafted construction and exotic materials adding substantial cost without clear performance correlation. The conservative analog-only approach avoids modern Class D efficiency advances and digital integration technologies that offer superior measured performance. Claims of unmeasurable effects without ABX testing validation contradict scientific audio principles.

## Advice

JMF Audio amplifiers deliver excellent measured performance that meets or exceeds transparency requirements for high-fidelity reproduction. However, the extreme pricing premium cannot be justified purely on performance grounds, as numerous alternatives provide equivalent or superior measured specifications at significantly lower cost. Potential purchasers seeking maximum measured performance per dollar should consider modern Class D alternatives or established competitors like Benchmark, NAD Masters, or Purifi-based designs. JMF Audio may appeal to buyers prioritizing French boutique construction and traditional analog approaches over cost-effectiveness, but such considerations fall outside objective performance evaluation.
