## Overview

FX-Audio (Feixiang) is an audio manufacturer based in Shenzhen, China, with the official corporate name Shenzhen Feixiang Digital Technology Co., Ltd. Established in 2011, the company develops and manufactures digital amplifiers, DACs, and headphone amplifiers, and is particularly known for its DAC-X6 series. Primarily targeting the low-cost desktop audio equipment market, the company has been providing products for entry-level audio enthusiasts for over a decade, gaining a certain level of support from budget-conscious users.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The official specifications for FX-Audio's flagship product, the DAC-X6 MKII, are an SNR of 112dB (headphone output), THD of 0.006%, and a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (Â±0.5dB). According to the measurement standards table, the SNR, frequency response, and THD all meet the criteria for transparency. However, in actual measurements by the third-party organization Audio Science Review, the SINAD value of the similar DAC-X7 model was only 97dB, which is below the 105dB considered transparent. This result is more than 15dB inferior to competing products like the Topping DX3 Pro+. Although the nominal specs are high, the measured performance tends to fall short, leading to an evaluation of its overall scientific validity as being at the industry average.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

FX-Audio employs standard designs that combine off-the-shelf DAC chips from companies like ESS Technology (ES9018, ES9038Q2M) and AKM (AK4493) with general-purpose op-amps from manufacturers like Texas Instruments (TPA6120A2, OPA2134). Its proprietary technology development is limited. The circuit design remains basic, with no evidence of patented technologies or advanced research publications. The technical specifications and measurement performance of its products do not show any outstanding advantages over competitors in the same price range, indicating a reliance on combining existing technologies. Therefore, the technology level is rated as below the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

FX-Audio's flagship product, the DAC-X6 MKII (approx. 8,599 JPY), features an XMOS USB controller and ensures a certain level of performance for its price. A market survey reveals that there are currently no products available at a lower price that have equivalent or superior functionality (USB/Optical/Coaxial inputs, headphone output) and performance (especially featuring an XMOS USB interface). While cheaper products exist, they use lower-grade USB controllers and are thus inferior in performance, making them unsuitable for comparison. Therefore, it is considered the most affordable option within its specific performance class, earning a perfect cost-performance score of 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As an emerging manufacturer from China, FX-Audio has limited objective data on long-term reliability. The product warranty is one year, which is standard for the industry, but information on domestic support systems and repair services is insufficient. While user reviews occasionally mention reports of initial defects or failures within a relatively short period, reports of major flaws in basic functionality are few. Firmware updates are provided for some models, but the long-term continuity of support remains uncertain. Due to its limited track record, its reliability is rated at the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

FX-Audio demonstrates a rational approach by presenting measurable performance indicators like SNR and THD in its product specifications and refraining from using unscientific claims or occult elements in its marketing. The strategy of integrating DAC and headphone amplifier functions at a low price to provide essential features for entry-level users in a single unit is reasonable. However, its new models do not show significant improvements in measurement performance, suggesting that its commitment to technological advancement is insufficient. While it meets the functions expected of a general audio product, it lacks innovative elements, resulting in an average rating.

## Advice

FX-Audio is a worthwhile option for entry-level users looking to improve the audio quality of their PC or gaming console under strict budget constraints. The DAC-X6 MKII, in particular, offers excellent cost-performance within its class, providing DAC and headphone amplifier functions with an XMOS chipset for under 10,000 JPY, making it a reasonable initial purchase. If you are currently using the built-in DAC of your PC or TV, introducing this product will likely provide a clearly perceptible improvement in sound quality.

However, if you are aiming for higher fidelity and long-term use, it is advisable to consider investing more initially in established products with significantly superior measured performance, such as the Topping DX3 Pro+. While these products cost several times more, they offer clear advantages in measurement performance, reliability, and support.
