## Overview

Founded by Joseph Grado in Brooklyn in 1953, Grado Labs continues as a family business now in its third generation. Since its founding, the company has insisted on handcrafted manufacturing by skilled artisans without relying on mass production.

All of the company's headphones feature open-back design, characterized by unique sound quality that richly expresses musical emotion. Upper models like the SR325e and PS2000e in particular achieve both acoustic characteristics and aesthetics through wooden housings and precision metalwork. They are still manufactured in the original factory, and their craftsmanship spirit has become a rare presence in the modern audio industry.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The scientific validity of Grado products is closely related to the company's sound philosophy. The natural soundstage reproduction through open-back design is an objectively measurable characteristic, and many users experience its effects.

However, the company's sound tuning doesn't necessarily aim for flat frequency response, with unique sound crafting that emphasizes musical emotion. In this respect, they take a different approach from pure faithful reproduction, and the evaluation of scientific validity is limited. However, emotional satisfaction in music listening is high, which can also be evaluated as a form of validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Grado's technology level is at a very high standard in a unique domain different from mass production manufacturers. They have accumulated numerous technologies that should be called craftsmanship, such as precision processing techniques for wood and metal, and manual adjustment techniques for driver units.

The processing technology for wooden housings used in upper models in particular is sophisticated, achieving both acoustic characteristics and aesthetics with originality that cannot be imitated by other companies. The technology of artisans manually adjusting individual differences in driver units also demonstrates a high technology level impossible with mass production.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A Chinese-made open-back headphone with equivalent measurement performance to the SR80e (USD 125) is sold for USD 62, so CP = USD 62 รท USD 125 = 0.5. A budget product with equivalent THD+N and frequency response to the SR225e (USD 195) exists for USD 97, so CP = USD 97 รท USD 195 = 0.5. A product with similar measurement performance to the PS2000e (USD 1,725) is sold for USD 860, so CP = USD 860 รท USD 1,725 = 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Grado products have very strict quality control due to their handmade manufacturing. Despite being a small family-run manufacturer, they provide long-term parts supply and service, and their sense of responsibility can be highly valued.

However, as a small manufacturer, there are limitations to their support system compared to major manufacturers. Particularly in the Japanese market, support is centered through official distributors, which may present challenges in terms of speed and convenience. Nevertheless, product durability is high, with quality that withstands long-term use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Grado's design philosophy is based on the clear goal of "richly expressing musical emotion," and their approach to achieving this is very rational. Natural soundstage reproduction through open-back design and designs that utilize the acoustic characteristics of wood and metal show careful consideration throughout for enhancing emotional satisfaction in music listening.

Additionally, maintaining their unchanged manufacturing methods since founding to preserve consistent quality and sound can be considered a rational management decision. Their stance of not relying on mass production differs from modern efficiency but embodies the company's philosophy of prioritizing quality and originality.
