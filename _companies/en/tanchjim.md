## Overview

Tanchjim is a Chinese audio brand established in 2015, specializing in the development of Hi-Fi in-ear monitors (IEMs). The company employs a specialized team of acoustical engineers and focuses on product development centered around their proprietary DMT (Dual Magnetic Technology) driver technology. They gained industry attention with their flagship Oxygen model and continue to expand their product lineup centered around the same series. The company name, formed from the initials of Technology, Art, Nature, Change, Judge, Interest, and Merge, reflects their corporate philosophy of fusing technology and art.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The measurement performance of Tanchjim products is at a moderate level. The Origin (260 USD) achieves THD<0.056%@1kHz distortion, but falls short of the transparent level of 0.01%, remaining at moderate performance. In objective measurements by Audio Science Review (ASR), the One was rated "very good to excellent" for target curve compliance, but overall it does not reach industry-leading standards. While there are no major issues with frequency response, multiple indicators fail to achieve transparent level clearance, leaving room for improvement.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Tanchjim's technology level is high within the industry. The 5th generation DMT5 driver achieves high magnetic flux density and low distortion through its dual-magnetic double-cavity structure, establishing unique technological advantages. They employ scientifically-based design methods including cavity design using FEA (Finite Element Analysis) simulation and in-house development of target response curves based on HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function). Acoustical engineering expertise is reflected in their products through optimized composite material diaphragms and controlled airflow structures. Rather than simple OEM products, they develop a product lineup with technological originality through in-house development.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Tanchjim's cost-performance varies by product but is excellent overall. For the Origin (260 USD), a more affordable alternative with equivalent functionality and measurement performance exists in the Simgot EA1000 (220 USD), resulting in 220 USD รท 260 USD = 0.85, showing good cost-performance. The entry-level One DSP (27.99 USD) has no equivalent performance products available, making it one of the world's most affordable options in this price range. The mid-range 4U (69 USD) also features advantageous pricing compared to competing products, achieving excellent cost-performance across the brand.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Tanchjim's reliability and support are at industry average levels but have room for improvement. They provide 1-year warranty on the main product and 3-month warranty on cables, but multiple user reviews report issues with cable quality. Criticisms such as "cables are ghetto" and "cable feels cheap and thin" are seen across multiple products, creating demand for cable replacements due to breakage. Additionally, the Oxygen has fit issues known as its "infamous achilles heel," representing challenges stemming from physical design. While support systems are established through authorized distributors like Linsoul and HiFiGo, specific reliability data such as RMA rates are not publicly disclosed.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Tanchjim's design philosophy adopts a rational approach based on scientific evidence. They emphasize a scientific approach independent of subjectivity and emotion, including in-house development of target response curves based on HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function), cavity optimization through FEA simulation, and tuning based on objective measurements. Under the clear direction of "scientific HiFi in-ear earphones," they aim to achieve ultra-low distortion and natural tonality, continuing technology development that contributes to achieving transparent levels in measurement standards tables. Multiple tuning nozzles and adjustable filter systems for customization also represent their rational design philosophy of scientifically addressing diverse user needs.

## Advice

Tanchjim is suitable for users seeking high-quality earphones based on scientific measurements. The Origin and One series in particular achieve excellent measurement performance and rational pricing, making them strongly recommended for users who prioritize objective sound quality improvement. However, due to issues with cable quality and fit of some products, consideration of aftermarket cable replacement at purchase is recommended. As they cover a wide price range from entry-level to high-end, selection according to budget is possible, with the technically sophisticated Origin and cost-performance excellent One DSP being particularly noteworthy.
