## Overview

Jabra is a Danish audio equipment manufacturer under the GN Group, founded as a telegraph company in 1869. With over 150 years of history, the company has deep ties to Japan, including involvement in laying telegraph cables connecting Japan to the Eurasian continent. In 2000, it acquired US-based JABRA Corporation, a mobile phone hands-free equipment manufacturer, and unified the brand to "Jabra" in 2009. While leading the headset market for an extended period, the company announced its exit from the consumer earphone and headphone business in 2024, with plans to dispose of inventory by the end of 2024.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Elite 10 and Elite 8 Active measurement results cover the 20Hz-20kHz frequency response range and demonstrate industry-average performance levels. Elite 8 Active measurements show maximum 91.6dB sound output capability, with bass 24.1% lower than average and mids 9% higher than average. However, published data for specific THD and SNR values is limited, and achievement of transparency levels (THD below 0.01%, SNR above 105dB) cannot be confirmed. While active noise cancellation is implemented, objective performance data from measurements is insufficient.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Elite 10 incorporates 10mm drivers while the Elite 8 Active uses 6mm drivers, and implements the world's first LE Audio-compatible smart case, demonstrating certain technical uniqueness. Dolby Audio-compatible spatial audio technology and ShakeGrip coating technology for anti-slip functionality represent practical technical innovations. IP57-IP68 water and dust resistance performance is properly implemented. However, basic acoustic performance remains at industry standard levels and lacks innovation compared to cutting-edge digital technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Elite 10 Gen 2 is priced at 190 USD and the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 at 170 USD. Compared to the equivalent measured performance Soundcore Liberty 4 NC (73 USD, 20Hz-20kHz support, active noise cancellation equipped), Elite 10 CP = 73 USD รท 190 USD = 0.39, Elite 8 Active CP = 73 USD รท 170 USD = 0.43. Despite equivalent functionality, the pricing is approximately 3 times higher, making it inferior from a pure performance-to-price perspective.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The quality control system based on the GN Group's 150-year history is well-established, providing a 2-year product warranty. GN Audio Japan has been established domestically with a comprehensive support system. However, the business exit decision in 2024 creates uncertainty regarding future long-term support and successor product development. While support continues during the current inventory disposal period, concerns remain about long-term sustainability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design approach emphasizing practicality, such as the LE Audio-compatible smart case with dual USB-C/3.5mm support and ShakeGrip coating technology specialized for workout use, can be considered rational. Active noise cancellation and Dolby Audio compatibility are appropriately implemented as standard features. However, the business exit decision reveals fundamental limitations in design philosophy that could not respond to intensified competition. Insufficient response to cost reduction through cutting-edge digital technology utilization made sustainable business model construction difficult.

## Advice

When considering Jabra product purchases, sufficient consideration must be given to the risk of future support termination due to business exit. While products currently being disposed of may offer temporary price advantages, they cannot be recommended from long-term usage and repair support perspectives. Selecting products from brands with continued development would be rational from long-term satisfaction and cost-performance viewpoints. Particularly given the current situation where equivalent functionality products like the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC are available at approximately one-third the price, clear reasons for choosing Jabra products are limited.
