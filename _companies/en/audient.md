## Overview

Audient is a British audio equipment manufacturer established in 1998 in Hampshire, England. The company entered the industry with the ASP8024 large-format analog console and has expanded to offer audio interfaces, microphone preamps, and monitor controllers based on pro studio mixing console technology. All products feature Class-A microphone preamps, and the company is known for its measurement-focused design philosophy aimed at achieving transparent audio quality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The flagship iD24 achieves excellent measured performance with THD+N 0.0015%, S/N ratio 100dB A-weighted, dynamic range 126.5dB, and frequency response ±0.5dB (10Hz-40kHz). These specifications meet transparency-level standards, minimizing audible degradation in the hearing range. The iD44's EIN -126dBu and CMRR >80dB, along with the iD14 MKII's frequency response ±0.5dB (10Hz-20kHz), also demonstrate good performance. However, some products show instrument input THD+N of 0.1%, which cannot be considered completely transparent, and not all products achieve world-class performance levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Class-A microphone preamp design employed across all products represents solid engineering with low-noise transistors, RF interference filtering, and a combination of surface-mount and conventional components. The 32-bit AD/DA converter technology and 126.5dB dynamic range achievement demonstrate technical capabilities exceeding industry standards. The strategy of applying console design expertise gained from professional studio experience to consumer products is commendable. However, this is essentially a combination of existing technologies without revolutionary proprietary innovations or industry-changing technological developments. The use of standard components like ESS Sabre DAC chips remains central to their approach.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The flagship iD24 (450 USD) faces competition from equivalent function and performance products like the MOTU M2 (199 USD, 120dB dynamic range). The calculation: 199 USD ÷ 450 USD = 0.44, meaning equivalent performance is available at approximately 40% of the price. The iD14 MKII (320 USD) also faces competition from the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (189 USD, 120dB dynamic range), with calculation: 189 USD ÷ 320 USD = 0.59. The average of these values 0.515 is rounded to 0.5. While Audient products certainly deliver excellent performance, their price advantage from a function and measured performance perspective is limited. Excluding professional reliability and brand value considerations, the pure performance-to-price ratio is inferior to competitor products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The 3-year product warranty exceeds industry standards, and free online support with RMA response systems are established. However, user communities report multiple instances of "horrifying stories of failure within years" and "warranty periods significantly below industry standards." Issues include continuous increases in iD22 problem threads, loud white noise problems in week-old new units, and driver/firmware bugs at 96kHz sample rates, indicating quality control challenges. While corporate support infrastructure exists, questions remain about actual product reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company adopts a rational approach emphasizing measurement performance transparency and unified Class-A circuit design for low distortion and low noise across all products. The strategy of applying console design technology with proven professional studio track records to consumer equipment represents scientifically-based audio quality improvement. The pursuit of transparency-level standards with 126.5dB dynamic range and 0.0015% THD+N is highly rational. However, considering that competitors achieve equivalent performance at lower costs, while the technical direction is correct, there is room for improvement in implementation efficiency and cost optimization.

## Advice

Audient products reliably deliver transparent audio quality, enabling professional studio-level performance in home environments. They are suitable choices for users who refuse to compromise on audio quality and value brand reliability. However, for those purely seeking cost-performance, we strongly recommend considering competitors like MOTU M2 or Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, which offer equivalent measured performance at lower prices. For long-term use, carefully observe usage conditions during the warranty period, considering some reported reliability issues. This is a company where decisions will differ based on whether professional track record is prioritized or cost-performance takes precedence.
