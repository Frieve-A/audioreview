## Overview

Dyson is a British engineering company founded by James Dyson, best known for premium home appliances. It entered audio with the Zone (2022) and the audio-only OnTrac (2024)[6]. The OnTrac launched at **499.99 USD** in the US[1] (Japan reference price **74,990円**[6]).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Per the manufacturer, the OnTrac uses **40mm/16-ohm** neodymium drivers, rated **6Hz–21kHz**, **THD 0.1% @ 94dB/1kHz**, and an **8-mic ANC** array sampling at **384,000 times/s** for up to **40 dB** reduction; battery life is rated **up to 55 hours**[1][2]. Third-party measurements report **weighted ANC attenuation 18.63 dB** (Bass **11.10** / Mid **21.87** / Treble **27.24 dB**) and **51.0 h** of battery life[3]. Extended ultrasonic bandwidth brings negligible audibility gains. By contrast, Sony’s WH-1000XM5 measures **25.81 dB** overall ANC (Bass **17.63** / Mid **28.25** / Treble **33.04 dB**)[4]. Score: 0.6.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Dyson’s execution is sophisticated: **dual cells in the headband** for up to **55 h** runtime[2], **13° driver tilt**, **8-mic ANC**, and **2,000+ color combinations**[1][2]. While mechanically and ergonomically advanced, we don’t see measurement-level breakthroughs versus established leaders, hence 0.8.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better):** **Sony WH-1000XM5** — matches core functions (ANC/Bluetooth/calls/app EQ) and **beats the OnTrac in measured ANC**[4]. Representative US market price **299.99 USD** (Best Buy)[5].  
**Review target price (denominator):** **499.99 USD**[1].  
**CP calculation:** 299.99 ÷ 499.99 ≈ **0.60** → score **0.6**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a new audio entrant, long-term field data are limited (baseline 0.5). Dyson provides a **2-Year Limited Warranty** and global support infrastructure, adding +0.1 to **0.6** overall[2][12].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design prioritizes ownership experience (runtime, customization, materials). However, major costs don’t translate into **superior measured transparency or ANC** versus peers at the price, lowering rationality. Mechanical/algorithmic choices (driver tilt, ANC) are sensible, so we set **0.3**.

## Advice

Choose **OnTrac** if you value **exceptional battery life**, customization, and comfort. For **measurement-driven performance and value**, **Sony WH-1000XM5 (~299 USD)** is more rational[4][5]. If **maximum ANC** is your priority, consider **Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones** (MSRP **449 USD**)[10][11].
