## Overview

Yongse is a Chinese cable manufacturer founded in 2013, specializing in telecommunications and electronic products with a focus on audio cables [4]. Operating from a 5,300 square meter facility with over 4,500 staff, the company exports worldwide including the US, EU, South America, Middle East, and Asia [4]. Yongse produces headphone and earphone upgrade cables under various product lines including Titan II [1], Galaxy [2], Warrior OCC, Black Knight, Meteor, P10, Rainbow Plus, WhiteSnake, and Ruyi Rod, with prices ranging from 12.08 USD to 179.00 USD [3]. The company holds ISO9001:2000 quality certification and serves as an approved supplier for major manufacturers including Foxconn and Xiaomi [4]. Their product portfolio includes various conductor materials such as 6N single crystal copper, silver-plated copper, sterling silver, and pure silver constructions [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Yongse's product portfolio includes both high-priced and affordable cables. The company's high-priced products (up to 179 USD) make explicit audible sound quality improvement claims without providing scientific evidence or ABX blind test validation, claiming "35% more conductivity providing smooth and distortion-free sound quality" and "delivering high-resolution sound fields and rich bass and crystal clear treble" [5]. These high-priced products receive the lowest scientific validity score (0.0) according to evaluation criteria for high-priced products claiming audible improvements without scientific evidence. On the other hand, the company's affordable cable products (such as 12.08 USD) have no price premium and qualify for the base score of 0.5 for basic cable products. As a company review, considering both high-priced and affordable products as representative products, the average evaluation results in a Scientific Validity score of 0.3. However, the unsubstantiated audibility claims and absence of controlled testing data in high-priced products remain problematic issues classified in the category of scientifically unverifiable audio improvements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Yongse demonstrates standard cable manufacturing technology with some technical expertise. The company operates in-house design and manufacturing with CNC-machined components and anodized finishes, supported by testing equipment including APX555 audio testers and BK Acoustic comprehensive testers [4]. Their cable constructions use contemporary materials including 6N OCC copper and multi-strand configurations [3]. However, the technology represents conventional cable manufacturing without proprietary patents or cutting-edge innovations that would differentiate from industry standards. The analog-only approach lacks digital integration or advanced technological features. While their manufacturing scale and testing capabilities indicate reasonable technical competence, the core cable technology offers no competitive advantage and can be easily replicated by other manufacturers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Cost-performance evaluation reveals cheaper equivalent alternatives in the market. Yongse's lowest-priced product at 12.08 USD [3] competes against equivalent silver-plated copper cables available from approximately 8.79 USD on platforms like AliExpress, with Linsoul offering comparable functionality under 20.00 USD. Budget alternatives provide equivalent user-facing functions including the same connector types (MMCX, 2-pin), termination options (3.5mm, 4.4mm), and basic materials (silver-plated copper). Using the cost-performance formula: CP = 8.79 USD ÷ 12.08 USD = 0.73, rounded to 0.7. The calculation demonstrates that equivalent functionality can be obtained at approximately 73% of Yongse's lowest pricing, indicating reasonable cost-performance positioning in the upgrade cable market.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Yongse provides standard reliability and support infrastructure for cable products. The company offers a 1-year manufacturer warranty covering defects with free replacement service during the warranty period [5]. Cable construction represents simple, inherently robust design with few components that naturally resist degradation and failure. The company maintains quality certifications including ISO9001:2000, ISO14001:2004, ROHS compliance, and UL/CE certifications [4]. Their established track record since 2013 and approval as a supplier for major companies including Foxconn, Xiaomi, and Changsheng indicates reasonable industry standing [4]. Support infrastructure relies primarily on dealer-based systems with manufacturer backing. The combination of simple construction, standard warranty coverage, and established company history provides adequate reliability assurance for cable products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Yongse's design philosophy varies significantly across product lines. The company's high-priced products lack scientific rationality and rely heavily on unsubstantiated marketing claims. They make audible improvement claims without measurement evidence or controlled testing, stating effects like "smooth and distortion-free sound quality" and "high-resolution sound fields" without scientific validation [5]. Their approach contradicts measurement-based audio engineering by claiming "35% more conductivity" without baseline reference or demonstrable audible benefits, with the majority of product costs appearing unrelated to measurable performance improvements, following the typical "audiophile cable" marketing approach rather than evidence-based engineering [5]. These high-priced products receive the lowest evaluation (0.0) for Rationality of Design Philosophy. On the other hand, the company's affordable cable products have no price premium and take a more rational approach, qualifying for the base score of 0.5. As a company review, considering both high-priced and affordable products as representative products, the average evaluation results in a Rationality of Design Philosophy score of 0.3. However, the unscientific claims and cost allocation unrelated to measurable performance improvements in high-priced products remain problematic issues that undermine design philosophy rationality.

## Advice

Yongse cables may serve purchasers seeking budget-friendly upgrade options with standard build quality and warranty support, particularly for users prioritizing visual aesthetics or specific connector compatibility. However, potential buyers should understand that claimed audible improvements lack scientific validation, and equivalent functionality is available at lower cost from alternative manufacturers. Consider Yongse products when budget allows for premium pricing over basic functionality, but avoid purchasing based on expected sound quality improvements. For cost-conscious users, equivalent silver-plated copper alternatives starting from approximately 9.00 USD provide identical audio transmission capabilities. Professional applications requiring verified electrical specifications should consider manufacturers like Mogami that publish comprehensive technical data including capacitance, inductance, and noise specifications with proper measurement conditions.
