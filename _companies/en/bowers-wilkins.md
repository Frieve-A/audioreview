## Overview

Founded 1966, acquired by Harman/Samsung 2025. British premium audio manufacturer with 323.6 million USD revenue, producing PX headphones and 600/700 speakers. Targets high-end market through luxury partnerships (BMW, McLaren) and studio collaboration [7].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Third-party measurements from RTINGS, ASR, and Hi-Fi News reveal mixed performance across B&W's portfolio [1][2][3]. For THD, the 603 S3 floorstanding shows 0.1% @ 1kHz and <0.1% @ 10kHz at 90dB SPL, approaching transparent levels, while the 607 S2 shows low tweeter distortion but woofer breakup issues [2][3]. Regarding frequency response, the PX8 headphones exhibit >±3dB deviations with overemphasized bass and recessed highs per RTINGS, while the 607 S2 speakers show elevated highs (+5dB above 7kHz) and limited bass extension (-6dB @ 40Hz) per ASR [1][2]. For S/N ratio, the PX8 achieved 4.2/10 on SoundGuys' MDAQS algorithm due to V-shaped frequency curve [4]. Overall, speakers demonstrate acceptable distortion performance but frequency response issues across product lines, while headphones show significant deviation from neutral targets, placing the company between problematic and transparent thresholds.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Strong patent portfolio: Continuum cones (8-year development), diamond tweeters, Matrix cabinets. Dedicated Steyning Research Establishment since 1982. Recent innovations include Biomimetic Suspension, solid tweeter construction [7].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

Company CP is evaluated using weighted average of representative products. **PX8 (599 USD, weight 0.4)**: Compared with Sony WH-1000XM5 (250 USD). THD: Sony shows "very low distortion" versus B&W's "very good" per RTINGS [1]. Frequency response: Sony demonstrates more consistent response versus B&W's >±3dB deviations [1]. ANC and Bluetooth functions equivalent. CP = 250 ÷ 599 = 0.4. **607 S2 (450 USD/pair, weight 0.3)**: Compared with JBL 305P MkII (240 USD/pair). THD: JBL shows excellent transient response versus B&W's woofer breakup issues per ASR [5]. Frequency response: JBL provides flat studio tuning versus B&W's +5dB elevated highs [2][5]. Functions (bookshelf form, stereo playback) equivalent. CP = 240 ÷ 450 = 0.5. **603 S3 (1000 USD/pair, weight 0.3)**: Compared with ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 (245 USD/pair). THD: both show good distortion performance. Frequency response: ELAC demonstrates better balanced response versus B&W's elevated highs per ASR [6]. Functions equivalent. CP = 245 ÷ 1000 = 0.2.

Weighted CP = (0.4 × 0.4) + (0.5 × 0.3) + (0.2 × 0.3) = 0.37 → 0.4

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

5-year warranty for speakers, 2-year electronics. Global service network but documented issues: Formation connectivity problems, PX failures, expensive repairs, 4-month delays. Firmware updates continue but service quality inconsistent [8].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Substantial R&D investment in proprietary technologies shows genuine innovation. However, "True Sound" marketing claims lack scientific backing and measurement verification. Technology advancement proven but transparency limited [7].

## Advice

B&W provides genuine innovations (Matrix cabinets, diamond tweeters) but measurement performance varies significantly. Sony WH-1000XM5 and JBL 305P MkII offer better measured performance at lower cost. Consider B&W for specific proprietary tech or studio heritage, but evaluate measurements carefully against premiums. Reliability concerns suggest extended warranty.
