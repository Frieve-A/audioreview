## Overview

Founded in 1966 by John Bowers, this British premium audio brand has continued pursuing innovative technology and superior sound quality under the philosophy of "conveying the emotion of music as it truly is." It is known for unique technologies unavailable elsewhere, including the diamond tweeters of the 800 series and proprietary Continuum cone technology.

The company was acquired by Sound United in 2020. Subsequently, in 2022, its parent company Sound United was acquired by the medical technology company Masimo. It is now part of Masimo's portfolio, which also includes other renowned audio brands like Denon, Marantz, and Polk Audio. As part of this major group, the company is actively pursuing modern audio devices including wireless headphones and smart speakers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

B&W products demonstrate not only subjective "good sound" but also excellent measured results. The diamond tweeters of the 800 series achieve superior high-frequency characteristics both theoretically and in actual measurements due to their hardness and lightness. The company's developed Continuum cone technology is also scientifically grounded, dramatically reducing mid-range distortion. However, design-focused products sometimes show acoustic compromises, and not all products are scientifically optimized.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company possesses industry-leading technical capabilities. Diamond tweeter manufacturing technology is unmatched by competitors, with active development of proprietary technologies including Continuum cones and Aerofoil profiles. Revolutionary approaches in each speaker design element include Nautilus technology for rear acoustic processing and the Matrix structure for cabinet design. Recent wireless products also apply technologies developed in traditional wired audio, such as Formation technology for high-quality wireless transmission.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

To evaluate the company's overall cost-performance, we examine several representative products. For instance, the flagship 805 D4 (approx. 9,000 USD per pair) can be compared with the Neumann KH 150, which offers equivalent or better measured performance for about 3,800 USD per pair (CP = 3,800 ÷ 9,000 ≈ 0.42). The 603 S3 (approx. 2,600 USD per pair) can be compared to the KEF Q750 (approx. 1,900 USD per pair) (CP = 1,900 ÷ 2,600 ≈ 0.73). Even the top-tier 801 D4 (approx. 38,000 USD per pair) has alternatives like the Genelec 8361A (approx. 13,500 USD per pair) (CP = 13,500 ÷ 38,000 ≈ 0.36). The average CP is approximately 0.50, leading to a score of 0.6. While performance is high, the price heavily reflects brand value and manufacturing costs.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Reliability as an established brand is high, with generally excellent product durability. After-sales service is comprehensive, with repair support often available for older products. However, recent wireless products cannot expect the same long-term reliability as traditional passive speakers regarding battery life and long-term firmware update support. Additionally, potential changes in the support structure since the 2022 parent company acquisition warrant future monitoring.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Product design is highly rational, with thorough implementation of acoustic engineering principles. All technical elements are organically combined toward the clear goal of "faithful reproduction." The adoption of diamond tweeters is not merely for luxury appeal but is genuinely aimed at improving acoustic characteristics. The design aesthetic also emphasizes functional beauty, ensuring visual appeal doesn't compromise acoustic performance. However, some products show designs that aren't completely rational due to balancing commercial requirements.

## Advice

B&W is an excellent choice for those seeking a "lifetime" audio system. While pricing is high, it delivers value commensurate with the investment.

- **Audio beginners**: Start with the 600 Series. This allows you to understand B&W's sonic characteristics with a clear upgrade path.
- **Intermediate to advanced users**: The 700 and 800 Series are the main targets. The 805 D4 is particularly outstanding, condensing 800 Series technology into a compact form.
- **Professionals**: The 800 Series and Nautilus are suitable, holding industry-standard status in many recording studios.
- **Modern lifestyle focus**: Wireless products, including the Formation series and PX/PI series, are well-developed.

We strongly recommend purchasing from authorized dealers. There are significant differences in after-sales service and warranty compared to parallel imports.
