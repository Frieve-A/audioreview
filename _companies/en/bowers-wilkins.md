## Overview

Founded in 1966 by John Bowers, this British premium audio brand has continued pursuing innovative technology and superior sound quality under the philosophy of "conveying the emotion of music as it truly is." Known for unique technologies unavailable elsewhere, including the diamond tweeters of the 800 series and proprietary Continuum cone technology.

Recent years have seen significant ownership changes. Acquired by Sound United in 2020, the business subsequently passed through medical technology company Masimo and now belongs to Samsung's Harman International portfolio. This places it in the same group as numerous renowned audio brands including Denon, Marantz, JBL, and Mark Levinson. As part of this major capital group, the company is actively pursuing modern audio devices including wireless headphones and smart speakers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

B&W products demonstrate not only subjective "good sound" but also excellent measured results. The diamond tweeters of the 800 series achieve superior high-frequency characteristics both theoretically and in actual measurements due to their hardness and lightness. The company's developed Continuum cone technology is also scientifically grounded, dramatically reducing mid-range distortion. However, design-focused products sometimes show acoustic compromises, and not all products are scientifically optimized.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company possesses industry-leading technical capabilities. Diamond tweeter manufacturing technology is unmatched by competitors, with active development of proprietary technologies including Continuum cones and Aerofoil profiles. Revolutionary approaches in each speaker design element include Nautilus technology for rear acoustic processing and Matrix structure for cabinet design. Recent wireless products also apply technologies developed in traditional wired audio, such as Formation technology for high-quality wireless transmission.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

805 D4 (USD 13,300) vs Chinese speakers with equivalent measured performance at USD 2,700, CP = 2,700 รท 13,300 = 0.2. 683 S3 (USD 8,700) vs budget products with equivalent THD+N, SNR, and frequency response at USD 2,000, CP = 2,000 รท 8,700 = 0.23. Even the flagship 800 D4 (pair, USD 33,000) has equivalent measured performance products available at USD 6,700, CP = 6,700 รท 33,000 = 0.2.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Reliability as an established brand is high, with generally excellent product durability. After-sales service is comprehensive, with repair support often available for older products. However, recent wireless products cannot expect the same long-term reliability as traditional passive speakers regarding battery life and long-term firmware update support. There are also reports of changes in support structure since the 2020 acquisition, requiring future monitoring.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Product design is highly rational with thorough implementation of acoustic engineering principles. All technical elements are organically combined toward the clear goal of "faithful reproduction." Diamond tweeter adoption is not merely for luxury appeal but genuinely aimed at acoustic characteristic improvement. Design aesthetics also emphasize functional beauty, ensuring visual appeal doesn't compromise acoustic performance. However, some products show designs that aren't completely rational due to balancing commercial requirements.

## Advice

B&W is the optimal choice for those seeking a "lifetime" audio system. While pricing is high, it delivers value commensurate with the investment.

- **Audio beginners**: Start with the 600 series. This allows understanding of B&W's sonic characteristics with a clear upgrade path.
- **Intermediate to advanced users**: The 700 and 800 series are the main targets. The 805 D4 is particularly outstanding, condensing 800 series technology into a compact form.
- **Professionals**: The 800 series, Nautilus, and recording studio product lines are suitable, holding industry standard status.
- **Modern lifestyle focus**: Wireless products including Formation series and PX/PI series are well-developed.

We strongly recommend purchasing from authorized dealers. There are significant differences in after-sales service and warranty compared to parallel imports.
