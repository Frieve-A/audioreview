## Overview

Zero Audio is a small Japanese earphone brand best known for the Carbo Tenore (ZH-DX200-CT). The Tenore launched in 2012 with an estimated street price under 5,000 円 and later drew global attention in 2016 as a standout sub-50-USD pick [2][3]. In 2025, the company’s lineup and technology have seen little change versus mid-2010s competitors, and availability is sporadic outside Japan.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Manufacturer specifications for the Carbo Tenore list a 5.78 mm dynamic driver, 8 Hz–24 kHz frequency response, 16 Ω impedance, and 102 dB/1 mW sensitivity [1]. Public, modern third-party lab measurements remain limited, so we provisionally hold at a neutral 0.5 using official specs while noting the absence of recent comprehensive data (e.g., controlled THD and isolation curves) [1][4]. We will incorporate newer verified measurements if they become available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Tenore uses a conventional single dynamic driver in a carbon-fiber + machined aluminum housing with a fixed OFC cable—no removable cable standard, DSP, or other recent advances [1]. Product and information pages indicate minimal platform evolution since the mid-2010s.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

**Representative company product:** Carbo Tenore (new, currently available white variant) at **59.99 USD** (Buy-It-Now) [8].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better alternatives (examples):**  
- **Moondrop CHU II** — 22.99 USD retail, removable cable, published spec **THD ≤ 0.5% @ 1 kHz, 94 dB**; widely measured/tuned to a modern target [5][6].  
- **7Hz Salnotes Zero** — 22.99 USD for 3.5 mm variant; removable cable; maker spec **THD < 1% @ 1 kHz** [7].

These comparators match user-visible functions (wired IEMs) and offer equal-or-better baseline performance (modern FR targets; stated low distortion). Using the cheapest valid comparator price (22.99 USD) against the Tenore’s representative new-market price (59.99 USD) yields a **CP score of 0.4**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The official Tenore page lists a **1-year warranty** [1]—shorter than many peers’ typical 2-year coverage—and the fixed cable is a common single point of failure by category norms. Community reports also note fragile build on legacy units, consistent with older budget designs [9]. Global support appears dealer-centric; firmware is not applicable to passive wired IEMs.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Zero Audio’s philosophy—lightweight single-DD earphones with acoustic tuning—is simple and coherent for low cost. However, the failure to adopt baseline modern features (removable cable, measurement-driven revisions) and to publish comprehensive, comparable performance data limits rational progression versus current peers.

## Advice

If you can buy a Tenore near its historical price, it remains an easy-listening pick. At today’s typical new-market prices, **Moondrop CHU II** and **7Hz Salnotes Zero** offer equivalent or better functionality and published performance claims for far less money [5][6][7]. Prefer those unless you specifically want the Tenore’s form factor or brand.
