## Overview

Founded in 2017, Loxjie focuses on desktop DACs and integrated amplifiers aimed at delivering good measured performance at aggressive prices. Current key models include the D40 Pro DAC and A40/A30 integrated amplifiers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Third-party data shows the D30 DAC around **114 dB SINAD** class, approaching transparency for DAC duties [1]. The A30’s **THD+N(A) 0.003%** and **SNR(A) 108 dB** (manufacturer spec) and **80 W×2 @4Ω** output indicate low distortion/noise in typical use [2]. The D40 Pro’s spec claims **THD+N ≈ −125 dB** (manufacturer; check test conditions) [3]. Caveat: the integrated headphone outputs on D30/A30 are modest (~100 mW @32Ω), so demanding headphones may need more power [2]. Overall, the brand’s published specs and available third-party measurements support a scientifically consistent, near-transparent approach.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Loxjie implements established platforms (ESS DACs, XMOS USB, Infineon/Merus Class-D, etc.) competently rather than pursuing novel topologies [2][3]. Execution is solid, breadth of features is good, but breakthrough proprietary innovations are limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Company CP is the **average of representative current models** (D40 Pro DAC, A40 integrated).

- **D40 Pro (430 USD)** [4] vs **Topping DX5 II (299 USD)** as an **equal-or-better** integrated USB DAC/HP-amp/preamp with excellent measurements [5].  
  → CP = 299 USD ÷ 430 USD = **0.695… → 0.7** (rounded to one decimal).

- **A40 (255 USD)** integrates HDMI ARC, DAC, BT, phono, and dual HP outs; the closest **equal-or-better** current alternative we found is SMSL **AO300** at **≈274.55 USD** (some stores ~269 USD), i.e., **more expensive** [6][7].  
  → **No cheaper equal-or-better exists → CP = 1.0**.

**Company CP = (0.7 + 1.0) / 2 = 0.85 → 0.9.**

> **Equivalence note:** DX5 II consolidates USB DAC/HP-amp/preamp with top-tier measured performance, satisfying **equal-or-better** functionality/performance vs D40 Pro [5]. For A40, we could not identify any cheaper unit matching its broad I/O (incl. HDMI ARC + phono + dual HP) and measured competence as of 2025-08-17 [6][7].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Given the brand’s relatively short history, long-term reliability data are limited. Warranty/support depend on seller channels; typical coverage and firmware updates (when applicable) are provided but large-brand service networks are absent. This is average for the price tier [2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Emphasis on measurable fidelity (THD+N, SNR, FR) over subjective claims, leveraging proven chipsets and efficient Class-D platforms at low cost, is rational and consumer-friendly [1][2][3].

## Advice

Great fit if you want strong measurements and broad features per dollar. If headphone drive power is critical, consider pairing with a dedicated more powerful HP amp or a higher-powered integrated.
