summary: "Korean pioneer in high-resolution portable audio. Since its founding in 2012, it has led technological innovation in portable players with DSD native playback and balanced output. Their product lineup featuring beautiful aluminum-machined chassis and latest DAC chips satisfies both sound quality and ownership desires. However, compared to Chinese products with equivalent sound quality, prices are 2-5 times higher, making the evaluation of design and brand value the deciding factor in selection."

## Overview

Astell&Kern was born in 2012 as a premium brand of iriver, a major Korean electronics manufacturer. In the then-niche high-resolution portable player market, they gained attention with the launch of the AK100 and have since continued to lead the advancement of high-quality and luxury portable audio.

Their distinctive features include luxurious circuit designs incorporating multiple latest DAC chips (AKM, ESS, Cirrus Logic, etc.) and beautiful chassis designs machined from aviation-grade aluminum. Flagship models like the SP3000 series, despite exceeding 667 USD in price, have garnered support from audiophiles worldwide.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Astell&Kern products demonstrate excellent performance in measurable sound quality indicators. THD+N (Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise) of 0.0003% or less and dynamic range of 120dB+ achieve values close to theoretical limits. Their proprietary AK DAC filter technology, offering options from sharp roll-off emphasizing phase characteristics to slow roll-off emphasizing auditory naturalness, can be considered a scientific approach. However, there is debate over whether these measured performance differences are actually audible, and results from double-blind tests completely excluding placebo effects have not been published.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

They invest cutting-edge technology at the highest level for portable audio devices. Dual DAC configuration, fully balanced circuits, independent clock circuits, and other design philosophies from high-end stationary audio equipment are condensed into portable sizes. Particularly, the SP3000 achieves native playback of 32bit/768kHz PCM and DSD512 through their proprietary TERATON ALPHA amplifier module. Their Android OS-based custom UI is intuitive, and with large-capacity storage (up to 1TB) and streaming service support, they fully accommodate modern music listening styles.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Chinese DAPs with equivalent measured performance (THD+N 0.0005%, SNR 120dB) to the SR35 (approximately 667 USD) are sold for 133 USD, resulting in CP = 133 รท 667 = 0.2. For the flagship SP3000 (approximately 1333 USD), DAPs with equivalent sound quality performance exist for around 200 USD, yielding CP = 200 รท 1333 = 0.2. When comparing pure sound quality performance excluding design and brand value, cost-performance is decidedly not high.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Backed by iriver, a major Korean electronics manufacturer, they maintain high corporate stability. Product quality control is thorough, keeping initial defect rates low. In Japan, authorized distributor Aiuto has established a comprehensive support system with prompt repair services. However, high battery replacement costs (200-333 USD) and the tendency for OS updates to end after 2-3 years are negative factors for long-term use considerations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

They have a clear design philosophy of balancing sound quality pursuit with design aesthetics. They adopt the latest DAC chips and make no compromises in power supply and analog circuit design. However, for products exceeding 1 million yen, the minimal measurable sound quality improvements raise questions about rationality from a pure sound quality pursuit perspective. Rather, they are stronger as crafted objects providing "ownership pleasure" like luxury watches, and from that perspective, their design can be considered sufficiently rational.

## Advice

Astell&Kern is an ideal choice for users who value not only sound quality but also design and brand value. For those seeking pure cost-performance, other options should be considered.

- **Entry Users**: We recommend starting with the SR35 or SR25 MKII. Even these models provide sufficient experience of high-resolution audio charm.
- **Sound Quality-Focused Users**: Mid-range models like SE300 or SP2000T offer a balanced choice between price and performance.
- **Collectors & Enthusiasts**: The SP3000 series is the ultimate choice satisfying both supreme sound quality and ownership desires.

It is crucial to audition before purchase and confirm whether you can perceive sound quality improvements commensurate with price differences. We also recommend making long-term ownership plans considering future battery replacement costs.
