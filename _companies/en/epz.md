## Overview

EPZ is a Chinese audio manufacturer established in 2019. The company claims to have achieved R&D and large-scale production of 3D-printed resin headphones within a few years of its founding. Its main products are IEMs in the 30-160 USD price range, with models such as the Q1 Pro, Q5, and K5. They feature 3D printing technology using medical-grade resin and a dual-cavity, dual-magnet circuit design with liquid crystal composite diaphragms. The company also produces portable DAC/amp products like the TP35 Pro, demonstrating active product development despite being a relatively new company.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

EPZ's products meet standard industry levels in measurement performance. The flagship IEM, the Q1 Pro, has specifications such as a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz, THD <0.5%@1kHz, and a sensitivity of 110dB. While its THD does not reach the ideal transparent level (below 0.05%), it avoids the problematic level (0.5% or higher). The Q5 has a sensitivity of 109dB, and the K5 has a sensitivity of 114dB, both featuring high efficiency. In their DAC/amp products, the TP35 Pro achieves an SNR of 130dB and the TP30 an SNR of 122dB, both exceeding the transparency threshold of 105dB. However, the distortion performance of their IEMs shows no distinct advantage over the latest products in the same price range, resulting in an average overall rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

EPZ is characterized by its integrated production system using 3D printing technology and its liquid crystal polymer composite diaphragm technology. The dual-cavity, dual-magnet circuit design is an acoustically rational approach. The use of Sonion BA drivers in the K5 is also an appropriate technical decision. However, these technologies are a combination of methods widely adopted in the industry and show no outstanding originality or breakthrough innovation. The dual CS43198 DAC configuration in the TP35 Pro is also a common design for products in this class. No dramatic improvements in measurement performance commensurate with the technology investment are observed, leading to a judgment of an industry-average technology level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

EPZ faces stiff competition in the highly contested low-price IEM market. Its entry-level model, the Q1 Pro (30 USD), is challenged by strong competitors like the 7Hz Zero 2 (25 USD), which offers equivalent or better performance at a lower price. Calculation: 25 USD ÷ 30 USD ≈ 0.83. On the other hand, for the higher-end model K5 (160 USD), products with equivalent or better hybrid configurations, such as the Truthear HEXA (approx. 80 USD), are available at about half the price. Their DAC/amp products show a similar trend. Looking at the company's entire product lineup, price competitiveness outside of entry-level models is limited. Therefore, its cost-performance is rated as slightly above the industry average.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a company founded in 2019, EPZ has a limited track record regarding long-term product reliability. Objective data such as product failure rates or MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) are not publicly available. Information on after-sales support systems, including warranty periods and repairs, is also scarce. The long-term support for DAC/amp products that require firmware updates is particularly uncertain. While it is presumed that they meet general industry standards for an emerging manufacturer, the lack of materials for assessing reliability compared to established manufacturers necessitates a below-average rating.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

EPZ's design approach is scientifically rational. Its development stance, which considers tunings like the Harman target curve and is based on measurement data, is commendable. The manufacturing of shells using 3D printing is a rational method that contributes to quality uniformity. Liquid crystal composite diaphragms and dual-cavity designs are also acoustically effective technologies. The company avoids unscientific, occult claims and exaggerated marketing, and its focus on improving measurable performance is a positive trait. However, there is room for further rationalization, as the active use of the latest DSP technology and a clear presentation of advantages as dedicated equipment in competition with general-purpose devices are insufficient.

## Advice

EPZ is an emerging manufacturer that offers technically solid products at affordable prices. The entry-level Q1 Pro, in particular, is a competitive option in the 30 USD price range. If you are attracted to the quality of 3D-printed shells or their proprietary driver technology, it is worth a try. On the other hand, when considering higher-end models like the K5, a careful comparison is essential, as numerous competing products offer better cost-performance. A rational approach is to understand the risks of an emerging company, first check the product quality and sound signature with their most affordable model, and then consider higher-end models if you are satisfied.
