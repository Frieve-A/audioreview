summary: "Audalytic, presented as an in-house brand from Gustard, targets entry-to-mid desktop audio with a streamer/DAC/head-amp focus. Its AH90 shows specification-level transparency at a low price, though independent long-term reliability data and broad third-party lab measurements are still limited."

## Overview

Audalytic is positioned as an in-house offshoot of Gustard aimed at delivering high-spec digital audio at accessible pricing [3]. The brand’s current visibility centers on the AH90 streaming DAC/headphone amplifier, which combines AKM’s AK4499EX+AK4191 with an XMOS XU316 USB interface and LAN streaming. Price positioning and feature density target buyers who want a compact, measurement-first desktop hub without moving to multiple separates [2][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Public, lab-grade third-party measurements remain scarce as of this writing. Manufacturer documentation specifies line-out performance of THD+N ≤0.0001% (1kHz), dynamic range >127dB, SNR >126dB, crosstalk −125dB (1kHz), and frequency response 20Hz–20kHz ±0.2dB; headphone out is specified at similar levels with dynamic range >123dB/SNR >122dB and max ~1W via 4.4mm for ≤64Ω loads [1]. These values meet or surpass transparent thresholds for DAC/amp electronics, so we rate scientific validity at the transparent borderline in the absence of broad independent datasets. Streaming transport is via Roon Bridge/UPnP (not certified Roon Ready), which is functionally transparent when implemented correctly [2][4].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AH90 deploys current-generation silicon (AK4499EX+AK4191, XMOS XU316) and a separated digital/analog topology with clocking marketed as “CK01” [2][4]. The design reflects competent integration of proven architectures rather than novel signal-processing inventions or new measurement methodologies. Streaming protocols (Roon Bridge, UPnP; AirPlay support) and a compact chassis with balanced/single-ended I/O are solid but not groundbreaking for 2024–2025 [2][4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Reference price for AH90 is 599 USD [2]. The cheapest equal-or-better one-box with equivalent user-facing functions and equal-or-better headline specs we identify is the **FiiO K15** at **549 USD**, offering LAN/Wi-Fi streaming with **Roon Ready** and **AirPlay 2**, dual AK4497S DACs, and up to **3000mW** balanced headphone output—functionally equal or superior in DAC/streaming/amplification roles [5][6][7].  
**Calculation:** 549 USD ÷ 599 USD = 0.916 → **0.9** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a newer label under Gustard’s umbrella, Audalytic leverages existing manufacturing and channel partners but lacks extensive independent reliability statistics. Retail distribution (e.g., ShenzhenAudio) lists a **two-year warranty**, suggesting average coverage for the segment; firmware updatability for network functions exists, but cadence and multi-year policy are not yet well characterized [2][6][8].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Emphasis on modern delta-sigma conversion, sensible clocking/power layout, and integrated streaming/headphone drive aligns with routes that measurably achieve transparency at the eardrum and reduce box count. The approach avoids occult claims and focuses on specifications that matter, though it largely refines established solutions rather than introducing audibly beneficial innovations beyond transparent baselines [1][2][4].

## Advice

If you want a compact desktop **streamer/DAC/head-amp** with spec-level transparency, the AH90 is a rational choice at 599 USD. Evidence currently relies on manufacturer specs rather than multiple third-party lab reports, but those specs sit well within transparent thresholds for DAC/amp electronics [1]. If cost-performance is paramount and you need certified Roon Ready plus notably higher headphone power, the **FiiO K15 (549 USD)** is a strong alternative with equal-or-better functional coverage [5][6][7]. For buyers prioritizing multi-year update policies and large installed bases, consider waiting for more field data or choosing brands with longer public firmware/support histories.
