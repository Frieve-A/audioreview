## Overview

Fidelix is an audio manufacturer that adopted Remote Sensing NFB (Negative Feedback) technology with the LB-4 amplifier in 1980. Currently manufacturing CERENATE power amplifiers as their main products, they feature compact amplifiers equipped with Remote Sensing terminals that enable proper control through speaker-side feedback.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

CERENATE specifications include 40W+40W (1kHz, 1% THD, 8Ω), THD 0.03% or below (36W+36W, 20-20kHz, 8Ω), frequency response DC-300kHz (+1, -3dB), and damping factor approximately 200. While THD 0.03% approaches transparent levels, important measurement data such as SNR, crosstalk, and IMD are not publicly available. Independent third-party measurement results are also not readily found, so the scientific validity is held at the baseline for measurement-unknown cases.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Remote Sensing NFB technology had technical significance in the 1980s, but no special advantages can be confirmed from current standards. CERENATE adopts SMPS power supply and DC Class AB design, but these are now common technologies. The current technical value of the Remote Sensing terminal as proprietary technology is limited, and it is judged to be at industry average technology level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

CERENATE's current market price is approximately 533 USD. As a comparison target with equal or better functions and measured performance, Topping PA3S (approximately 133 USD) can be cited. PA3S offers 80W+80W (4Ω), THD+N 0.0008%, and SNR 115dB-class published values, providing equivalent or better functions and performance. 133 ÷ 533 = 0.25, indicating low cost-performance levels.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While it is a Japanese manufacturer, current product development is limited and detailed information about long-term support systems is insufficient. Specific content regarding product warranty periods and after-service is unclear, and reliability data is not published. As a small-scale manufacturer, it is standard but below industry average levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Remote Sensing NFB technology itself has theoretical basis, but scientific verification of its effects is difficult with current measurement technology standards. While compact and lightweight design is practical, dependence on proprietary technology is high, and utilization of latest digital technology and measurement-based development approaches are unclear. Clear roadmaps for achieving transparent levels based on scientific evidence are not shown, and rationality is average.

## Advice

If interested in Fidelix products, we recommend first waiting for publication of independent measurement data. Currently, alternatives exist that provide equivalent performance at lower prices, so for those prioritizing cost-performance, considering measured products like Topping PA3S would be rational. Even if finding special value in Remote Sensing NFB technology, seeking objective verification data for its effects is important.
