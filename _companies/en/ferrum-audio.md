## Overview

Ferrum Audio is a Polish audio company launched by HEM, an established manufacturer with over 20 years of experience in OEM/ODM work. Named after the Latin word for iron, referencing CEO Marcin Hamerla's blacksmith heritage, Ferrum focuses on premium audiophile electronics. Their product lineup includes the OOR headphone amplifier, WANDLA DAC/preamp, HYPSOS hybrid power supply, and ERCO integrated DAC/amplifier. Despite being relatively new as a house brand, their products have gained recognition through industry awards and third-party measurements.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Ferrum’s measured performance is strong across its core products. For WANDLA, third-party APx555 testing shows Dynamic Range (AES17) of 120.2 dB, SNR 118.5 dB, and noise level of 7.99 µVrms (20–20 kHz). Its HQ digital filters (“HQ Apod”/“HQ Gauss”) achieve full 96 dB attenuation by 22.05 kHz while maintaining a flat passband, indicating technically correct reconstruction behavior. Output impedance is 44 Ω (balanced) / 22 Ω (SE) at the line outs, with wide-band noise 17.13 µVrms (20–90 kHz). For the OOR amplifier, measurements include THD+N ≈0.00048 % at 4 Vrms/1 kHz (20 kHz BW), noise ≈12.84 µVrms (20 kHz, ≈-109 dB ref. 4 Vrms), output impedance 0.3 Ω (balanced) / 0.15 Ω (SE), and maximum power around 8.5 W into 32 Ω and 1.9 W into 300 Ω. These quantified results support a score above the transparency threshold, hence 0.8.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The company demonstrates significant technological sophistication through several innovations. Their discrete amplifier topology moves away from conventional IC-based designs, implementing fully balanced differential circuits. The WANDLA features a custom SERCE digital audio platform with ARM processing and proprietary current-to-voltage stages. Collaboration with HQPlayer’s Jussi Laako yielded custom reconstruction filters beyond standard ESS implementations. HYPSOS combines advantages of linear and switching supplies via a hybrid design. The Ferrum Power Link (FPL) ecosystem shows system-level integration. These represent material engineering work beyond off-the-shelf solutions.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Cost-performance remains the main drawback.  
• **OOR (USD 1,995)** vs **TOPPING A70 Pro (USD 499)**: the A70 Pro delivers comparable or stronger measured performance at roughly a quarter of the price, while matching core functionality (balanced HP amp + preamp).  
• **WANDLA (USD 2,795)** vs **RME ADI-2 Pro FS R BE (USD 1,555–1,999)**: the RME unit provides equal-or-greater functional breadth (adds high-quality ADC and extensive DSP) with excellent measurements at a substantially lower street price.  
Averaging across the representative amplifier and DAC yields a cost-performance well below peers, justifying the 0.4 score.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Ferrum benefits from HEM’s long manufacturing experience. Products have earned industry recognition and sustained reviewer interest, suggesting mature engineering and QC. As a newer consumer brand, long-term field reliability data are still limited versus larger incumbents. Global dealer support exists but is not as dense as mass-market rivals. HYPSOS’ hybrid design adds complexity but is based on well-established principles.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Ferrum’s design choices—fully balanced discrete stages, hybrid power delivery, and properly designed reconstruction filters—are technically grounded. High maximum output levels (e.g., WANDLA’s 10 Vrms balanced line out) and modular FPL integration provide rational, measurable benefits. While pricing targets a premium niche, the engineering aims at verifiable performance improvements rather than purely subjective claims.

## Advice

Ferrum suits buyers prioritizing build quality and advanced engineering over value. WANDLA is the strongest technical showcase; if you don’t need its specific features, alternatives like RME’s ADI-2 Pro provide broader functionality per dollar. OOR offers excellent measured headroom and low impedance drive but faces severe cost pressure from the TOPPING A70 Pro. HYPSOS can be beneficial for compatible stacks but its cost should be weighed carefully.
