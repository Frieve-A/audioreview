## Overview

Waves Audio Ltd., founded in October 1992 by Gilad Keren and Meir Sha'ashua in Tel Aviv, Israel, pioneered the commercial audio plugin industry with the release of the Q10 Paragraphic Equalizer—the world's first commercially available audio plugin. The company received a Technical Grammy Award in 2011 for "contributions of outstanding technical significance to the recording field," cementing its reputation in professional audio.

Waves offers over 200 software products spanning music production, engineering, mixing, and mastering, alongside hardware including the SoundGrid ecosystem of audio interfaces, stageboxes, and DSP servers. Their proprietary SoundGrid networking technology enables real-time plugin processing with sub-millisecond latency, and their psychoacoustic expertise extends to licensing partnerships with major manufacturers including Dell, Google, Fitbit, and Asus.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The IONIC 24 stagebox demonstrates excellent specifications across key audio quality indicators, with manufacturer-stated frequency response of ±0.1 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz at 48 kHz sample rate, significantly exceeding transparent level requirements of ±0.5 dB. THD+N specifications of -100 dB at +24 dBu and -105 dB at +18 dBu substantially surpass transparent level thresholds, while dynamic range exceeding 110 dB and equivalent input noise of -130 dBu represent excellent performance for professional microphone preamps [1]. However, evaluation scope is limited by available measurement data covering primarily hardware products, while the company's core business involves software plugins where comprehensive third-party measurements are not publicly available. Conservative evaluation applied due to reliance on manufacturer specifications rather than independent third-party verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Waves demonstrates exceptional technical sophistication through pioneering audio plugin development, proprietary SoundGrid networking protocols, and extensive psychoacoustic research applications. SoundGrid technology represents significant innovation in audio-over-Ethernet protocols, utilizing FPGA-based conversion while enabling processing of hundreds of plugins simultaneously [2]. The system operates as an Ethernet Layer 2 protocol for predictable audio transport and processing, previously exclusive to dedicated DSP systems. Their 30-year accumulation of psychoacoustic knowledge and DSP algorithm development, combined with licensing partnerships with major technology companies, demonstrates technical expertise that competitors actively seek to adopt. Advanced integration of networking, DSP, and software technologies in a coherent ecosystem represents cutting-edge approach to professional audio processing.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Current market price for the IONIC 24 stagebox is 3,499 USD. Equipped with professional preamps and SoundGrid networking capabilities, and input/output configuration and sample rate capabilities are equivalent-or-better when compared to the Midas DL251 Pro Series stagebox at 3,555 USD [3]. The comparison target provides 48 analog inputs and 16 outputs versus IONIC 24's 24 inputs and 18 outputs, AES50 networking for professional digital console applications, and acclaimed MIDAS microphone preamps comparable to Waves Signature preamps. No cheaper alternative with equivalent stand-alone SoundGrid network functionality and professional preamp quality was identified, positioning the IONIC 24 as competitively priced within its specialized ecosystem.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Waves demonstrates strong reliability credentials through three decades of continuous operation and Technical Grammy Award recognition, indicating long-term industry trust. Professional hardware construction features robust 3RU rack-mountable chassis design, while software architecture benefits from extensive field testing across professional installations. Global support infrastructure includes dedicated technical support and comprehensive documentation systems. However, standard 1-year limited warranty period aligns with industry average rather than exceeding expectations. The company's 30+ year operational track record provides confidence in long-term product support and parts availability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company's design philosophy emphasizes scientifically-grounded approaches to audio improvement, with technology development focused on measurable performance benefits and psychoacoustic research foundation. Their progression from software-only offerings to integrated hardware-software ecosystems demonstrates logical technological evolution, with core technology investments directly contributing to functional performance improvements including SoundGrid latency optimization and processing capability enhancement. Consistent advancement from the first commercial plugin in 1992 through current SoundGrid ecosystem represents continuous innovation over 30+ years. Advanced functional integration of networking, processing, and control systems suits professional workflow requirements, while leading adoption of network audio protocols and DSP optimization technologies demonstrates pioneering approach that establishes industry direction rather than following trends.

## Advice

For professional environments requiring advanced plugin processing capabilities and real-time networking, Waves offers unmatched technical sophistication through SoundGrid technology and extensive software ecosystem. The ability to process hundreds of plugins simultaneously provides compelling advantages for high-end studio and live sound applications where processing power and networking flexibility are essential. Within the SoundGrid ecosystem, the IONIC 24 represents competitive value compared to alternatives offering similar standalone network audio functionality and professional preamp quality. However, users seeking basic network stagebox functionality without SoundGrid-specific features should evaluate alternatives like Behringer S32 or similar AES50-based products that may offer better value for conventional digital console applications. Purchase recommendation depends entirely on whether SoundGrid ecosystem benefits and plugin processing requirements justify the specialized functionality over standard network audio solutions.
