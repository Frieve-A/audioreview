## Overview

DUNU is a Chinese audio manufacturer established in 1994, primarily focusing on the development and manufacturing of earphones and in-ear monitors (IEMs). Initially operating as an ODM/OEM company supplying products to major audio and communication companies, the company now concentrates on its own brand products, developing proprietary technologies such as ECLIPSƎ driver technology and the Q-Lock modular plug system. They offer products across a wide price range including the SA6 series, Falcon series, and TITAN series, with recent models like Glacier and Arashi winning awards at VGP 2025 SUMMER.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

DUNU's measurement specifications remain at a moderate level. For instance, the SA6 MKII's THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) is rated at less than 0.5% at 1kHz, which, while acceptable, falls short of the transparent level of 0.05% or below. Regarding frequency response, the Falcon Pro has been noted for reduced clarity due to its emphasized mid-bass, a tuning that deviates from the high-fidelity standard of 20Hz-20kHz within ±3dB. Even with multi-driver configurations, it is questionable whether the measured performance shows improvement commensurate with the price. As products with superior measurement results exist in the same price range, the scientific validity is rated slightly above average.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The ECLIPSƎ driver technology demonstrates technical uniqueness by combining a proprietary magnetic circuit design with advanced diaphragm technology. The Q-Lock modular plug system also represents a practical technological innovation that enhances user convenience. The SA6 MKII's 6-balanced armature configuration, adoption of ADLC (Amorphous Diamond-Like Carbon) diaphragms, and CNC-machined stainless steel shells show considerable technical investment in materials engineering. Collaboration with high-quality driver suppliers like SONION and Knowles to create customized drivers is also commendable. However, these technologies are primarily improvements or combinations of existing technologies and do not represent major breakthroughs for the industry.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

To evaluate the company's overall cost-performance, we analyze two representative products. For the mid-range SA6 MKII (579 USD), the Moondrop Blessing 3 (320 USD) exists as a cheaper alternative with equivalent or superior performance, resulting in a CP of `320 USD ÷ 579 USD ≒ 0.55`. Meanwhile, for the Falcon Pro (220 USD), the Truthear HEXA (80 USD) exists in a much lower price bracket with superior measured performance, yielding a CP of `80 USD ÷ 220 USD ≒ 0.36`. The average of these two CP values is approximately 0.46, leading to a score of 0.5. As a whole, the company's product lineup faces significant challenges in cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

DUNU provides a one-year international warranty, maintaining an industry-standard support structure. Warranty service is primarily handled through authorized dealers, with major retailers like Linsoul offering customer support five days a week. Direct support through forums like Head-Fi and recent customer feedback show positive evaluations such as "good quality" and "excellent usability." However, warranty periods vary by product (e.g., cables are covered for 3 months), and repairs require 1-3 weeks through dealers, which is standard for a premium brand. While the company has 30 years of experience, specific reliability data is not widely disclosed.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

DUNU's design philosophy encompasses both technical development aimed at improving measurement performance and tuning that emphasizes musical expression. The pursuit of low distortion through ECLIPSƎ technology and band division via multi-driver configurations are scientifically rational approaches. On the other hand, the intentional mid-bass emphasis in products like the Falcon Pro represents a "musical" tuning direction that prioritizes subjective "pleasantness" at the expense of transparency and fidelity. While product development utilizes modern measurement techniques, the ultimate sound quality goal often leans toward "auditory preference," deviating from a pure high-fidelity pursuit. The direction of technical investment is generally rational, but there is an evident emphasis on product differentiation over achieving transparent-level sound quality.

## Advice

DUNU is a mid-tier manufacturer with certain technical capabilities, but a purchase requires caution. Many of its products feature tuning that prioritizes subjective listening pleasure over measured fidelity, and they also face challenges in cost-performance. It is essential to conduct a thorough comparison with competing products before buying, especially since more affordable alternatives with superior performance exist even for their higher-end models. For those who seek faithful sound reproduction or prioritize cost-effectiveness, more rational choices are widely available from other manufacturers. Unless you are strongly attracted to their proprietary technology or design, a cautious approach is recommended.
