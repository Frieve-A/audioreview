## Overview

CAIG Laboratories, Inc. specializes in contact cleaners and treatments, best known for the DeoxIT line. Established as a chemical maker for electronic maintenance, CAIG has a notable presence in pro audio and music gear service through deoxidizing and protective contact-treatment products aimed at improving reliability of switches, pots, and connectors.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

CAIG claims DeoxIT chemically improves connections by dissolving oxides/sulfides and leaving protection; CAIG’s own technical notes state “approximately 20% deoxidizing/cleaning action.” Independent, peer-reviewed measurements quantifying contact resistance changes under controlled conditions are scarce, and CAIG itself advises independent testing for critical applications [1][2]. In the absence of third-party, before/after resistance data, audible improvements attributable to the chemistry remain unverified beyond manufacturer claims.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The formulations combine active deoxidizers with carrier solvents and protective/lubricating components—solid, industry-standard chemistry rather than novel process innovation. CAIG documents variant lines (e.g., Gold/Shield) for plated or severe environments, but technical originality beyond established contact-treatment approaches is limited [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

To comply with objective CP rules, we compare against the **cheapest equivalent-or-better** product we could identify. DeoxIT D5 (5% solution, 5 oz) sells for **17.95 USD** [3]. An equivalent competitor with the same user-facing function set—**contact cleaner that deoxidizes and preserves**—is **Peavey Funk Out** (5 oz), **16.99 USD**; Peavey explicitly claims “deoxidizes, cleans, and preserves,” satisfying the equivalence note from a user perspective [4][5].  
**CP calculation:** 16.99 USD ÷ 17.95 USD = **0.946…**, rounded to **0.9**.  
Note: zero-residue “cleaners only” are cheaper but **not equivalent** because they lack deoxidizing/preserving claims.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

CAIG provides datasheets/SDS and product guidance, with explicit disclaimers recommending independent testing for critical use cases [2]. Public failure-rate, MTBF, or long-term comparative performance datasets are not published, so reliability is judged average with limited third-party corroboration.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Targeting oxide films on contacts is a rational engineering goal, and chemical deoxidation is a plausible means to reduce intermittent connections. However, heavy reliance on unverified claims rather than transparent third-party measurements limits confidence. The direction is reasonable; the validation depth is not.

## Advice

Use DeoxIT (or equivalent deoxidizing cleaners) when simple solvent cleaning fails to restore stable contact. For mission-critical cases, follow CAIG’s own guidance and run small-scale controlled tests (contact resistance before/after) on representative parts [2]. For basic dust/oil removal where deoxidation isn’t required, **zero-residue cleaners** such as MG Chemicals 409B offer substantially lower prices (e.g., 10.42–11.50 USD for 140 g/12 oz class, vendor-dependent) but are **not** function-equivalent to DeoxIT’s deoxidizing/preserving role [6].
