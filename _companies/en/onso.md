## Overview

Onso is a Japanese cable brand launched in 2009 by HISAGO DENZAI, specializing in portable audio and desktop audio connection cables. The company offers 94 products including earphone cables, headphone cables, coaxial, USB, XLR, and optical cables with prices ranging from ¥638 to ¥39,600. Onso positions itself as applying accumulated know-how in conductor configuration and cable construction, claiming to provide "better sound" through their cable designs. The company emphasizes Made in Japan manufacturing and offers a wide range from budget-friendly general products to premium offerings, targeting both portable and desktop audio enthusiasts.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Onso claims improved sound via conductor selection/twisting, yet provides no scientific evidence or measurement data, and key specs (e.g., DC resistance, capacitance) are typically missing[1][5]. No ABX blind testing or equivalent audibility evidence is shown. However, the brand also offers non-premium, general-purpose cables where no audible difference is expected; per policy, such basic products default around 0.5. Given the portfolio includes both premium claims (0.0) and basic cables (0.5), we conservatively rate the company-level Scientific Validity at 0.2.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Onso employs conventional high-purity copper conductor technology that has been widely available for decades. While the company claims years of accumulated know-how in "twisting together several types of conductors," this represents standard cable manufacturing techniques rather than technological innovation. Their product development, exemplified by the 3-year development period for the iect_06_mr model, focuses on traditional analog cable construction without adoption of cutting-edge technology, patents, or digital integration. The company's approach lacks significant technical differentiation that other manufacturers would desire to adopt, resulting in technology that offers no measurable advancement over established cable construction methods. The absence of proprietary technology or innovative manufacturing processes limits their technical achievement to basic craftsmanship rather than engineering advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Company review: we compute CP using two representative products (budget and premium), then take the simple average.

- Equivalence (summary): User-facing function and measurable performance equivalence; internal construction ignored per policy.

- Budget representative: Onso `hpcs_b1_ub33` 3.5mm-to-3.5mm headphone cable, 4,070円[2]
  - Comparator: Amazon Basics 3.5mm stereo AUX cable, 685円 (current lowest example)[7]
  - CP = 685円 ÷ 4,070円 = 0.168 → 0.2 (rounded to one decimal)

- Premium representative: Onso `iect_06_ub3mr` MMCX earphone cable, 27,500円[4]
  - Comparator: TRN T3 Pro MMCX cable, 5,380円 (current lowest example)[8]
  - CP = 5,380円 ÷ 27,500円 = 0.195 → 0.2 (rounded)

- Score: Average of the two → 0.2.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Onso provides extremely limited warranty coverage of only 1 month for purchases from authorized dealers, significantly below industry standards of 1-2 years for cable products. This brief warranty period suggests either lack of confidence in product longevity or inadequate customer support policies. Warranty coverage excludes purchases from non-authorized Amazon sellers, further limiting practical support accessibility. However, the company benefits from simple cable construction that is inherently more reliable than complex electronic devices, and HISAGO DENZAI has maintained market presence since 2009, indicating some degree of business stability. The combination of very short warranty periods with basic product reliability results in average support performance despite the company's established market presence.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Onso's design philosophy emphasizes accumulated know-how in conductor configuration and cable construction, but lacks scientific foundation for verification. The company aims to provide "better sound" but fails to demonstrate measurable performance advantages over standard cable construction. Their approach includes unsubstantiated audio claims that contradict established scientific understanding of cable performance. The company's pricing for some products, combined with marketing claims of audible improvements without measurement data or controlled testing, raises questions about design philosophy rationality. However, the company offers a wide price range and provides appropriate cost-performance in budget-friendly products. The absence of scientific verification and reliance on subjective claims rather than measurable improvements represents areas for improvement in design philosophy.

## Advice

Onso product selection depends on price range and intended use. Budget-friendly products (¥638 to approximately ¥4,000) provide appropriate cost-performance and are suitable for basic cable replacement needs. However, higher-priced products lack clear measurable performance advantages or scientific evidence, requiring careful consideration. Consumers seeking cable replacements should prioritize products with published electrical specifications, transparent pricing, and rational approaches to cable design. For higher-priced products, consider alternatives from manufacturers that publish measurement data supporting their claims or focus on measurable benefits like improved durability or specialized connector configurations rather than subjective sound quality assertions. The 1-month warranty period is short, so consider other manufacturers for long-term use scenarios.
