summary: "Fluid Audio offers affordable studio monitors with coaxial driver designs, though measured performance shows frequency response irregularities that prevent achieving transparent sound reproduction levels."

## Overview

Fluid Audio is a Southern California-based pro audio manufacturer founded by loudspeaker engineer **Kevin Zuccaro**, who began his career at **JBL** in 1990 and later worked at **Cerwin-Vega** and **M-Audio**. The company focuses on affordable studio monitors including the **FX** (coaxial), **C** (2-way), and **Image 2** (3-way) series. [8]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Third-party Klippel-NFS data for **FX50** show a **Preference (Tonality) score of 2.82**, improving to **5.29 with a perfect sub**, and a **frequency deviation of 5.2 dB** over the **300 Hz–5 kHz** reference band—indicating audible response issues without EQ. [1][2] The **FX50/FX80** user manual lists **49 Hz–22 kHz (±3 dB)** as manufacturer bandwidth. [3] Subsequent testing of **FX50v2** reports a **retuned response (flatter than v1) with residual artifacts**; overall transparency remains typical of budget monitors. [4]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The FX series implements a **coaxial two-way** design with **bi-amped Class-D 90 W (50 W + 40 W)**, a **5-inch paper cone woofer** and **1-inch silk-dome tweeter**, front-porting, **XLR/TRS/RCA** inputs, and basic room EQ DIP switches. It is a modern, sensible entry-level feature set rather than a breakthrough in loudspeaker engineering. [3][5]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

- **Fluid Audio FX50v2**: **USD 149** each (current general sale price). [5]  
- **Comparator (equal-or-better)**: **JBL 305P MkII**, **USD 159** each, with measurably flatter response (**Preference ≈ 4.5; 6.58 with sub; frequency deviation ≈ 3.7 dB**). [6][7]

Because **no cheaper product with equal-or-better user-visible functions and measured performance** is available at the time of writing, the cost-performance score is **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Construction, warranty, and retail support appear typical for budget active monitors. No credible evidence indicates materially superior or inferior reliability compared with peers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Fluid Audio prioritizes **compact size and affordability** over maximal neutrality/SPL. This is coherent for desktop/nearfield use but benefits from **EQ and a subwoofer** to reach higher transparency. [2][4]

## Advice

**Buy if:** you want a **coaxial point-source** budget monitor with full I/O and will use **EQ** (and ideally a **sub**) for best results. [2][3]  
**Skip if:** you require **neutral response out of the box**—options like **JBL 305P MkII** measure flatter and remain competitively priced. [7]
