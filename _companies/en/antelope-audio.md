summary: "Founded in Bulgaria in 2005, Antelope Audio is a company that revolutionized the industry with high-precision master clocks using atomic clock technology. Today, centered around its Synergy Core platform, it offers audio interfaces with excellent AD/DA conversion performance. While the flagship Galaxy 64 model is highly competitive in the multi-channel Dante market, more affordable alternatives exist. The company's biggest challenge lies in its software stability and support system, with many users reporting issues with drivers and the control panel. The current situation is that the reliability of the software has not caught up with the excellent sound quality and technical capabilities of the hardware."

## Overview

Antelope Audio was founded in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2005 by Igor Levin. The company is a pioneer in applying atomic clock technology to audio master clocks, and its high-precision clocking technology is highly regarded in the industry. In recent years, Antelope has focused on its "Synergy Core" real-time effects platform, which combines FPGA and DSP, making multi-channel audio interfaces like the Galaxy and Orion series its flagship products. It offers a wide range of products targeting everyone from professional recording studios to project studios.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Antelope Audio's current product lineup receives a very high rating from a scientific validity perspective. The latest generation of AD/DA converters boasts a dynamic range of up to 130dB, which, in terms of measurement, reaches a "transparent" level beyond the limits of human hearing. The company's proprietary 64-bit Acoustically Focused Clocking (AFC) technology suppresses jitter (time-axis fluctuations) to an extreme degree, an approach with a clear scientific basis for improving soundstage stability and detail reproduction. These technologies ensure extremely high fidelity to the master source, achieving what can be considered scientifically ideal performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company's technology level is advanced within the industry. Its core "Synergy Core" platform utilizes a hybrid of FPGA and DSP to enable real-time processing of numerous plugins at low latency without burdening the CPU. This provides a significant technical advantage, especially in recording monitoring environments. Furthermore, the flagship `Galaxy 64 Synergy Core` model integrates 64 channels of analog I/O, Dante, HDX, and Thunderbolt connectivity into a compact 1U chassis, demonstrating sophisticated implementation technology. Including its discrete preamps and other proprietary technologies, Antelope Audio possesses a high level of technical potential that is well-regarded in the industry.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Antelope Audio's products are competitively priced considering their features and performance, but they are not always the cheapest option. For instance, the flagship `Galaxy 64 Synergy Core` (approx. 9,995 USD) is one of the few products to offer 64 channels of analog I/O and Dante connectivity in a single unit. However, an equivalent setup can be achieved more affordably by using two units of the competitor `Ferrofish A32pro Dante` (totaling approx. 7,700 USD). Based on this comparison, the cost-performance is calculated as `7,700 USD ÷ 9,995 USD ≒ 0.77`, resulting in a score of 0.8. Across the entire product line, while offering excellent performance, there are cases where more cost-effective alternatives exist.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Reliability and support have been Antelope Audio's biggest long-standing challenges. While the excellent sound quality of their hardware is praised in many user reviews, dissatisfaction with the stability of software and drivers is repeatedly pointed out. Problems such as driver installation issues (especially in Windows environments), bugs in the control panel, and unexpected connection drops or noises are frequently reported. Although there are claims that the support system is improving, negative feedback such as "problems are not resolved" or "responses are slow" remains prevalent. This is a major concern for users who require absolute stability for professional use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The technical approach to sound quality improvement, such as atomic clock technology and FPGA-based real-time processing, is highly rational and commendable. However, the neglect of software development, which is crucial for users to stably enjoy that excellent hardware performance, must be deemed irrational from an overall design philosophy perspective. The fact that issues regarding software stability have been pointed out for many years without fundamental improvement indicates a disconnect between technical ideals and user experience. The products have high potential, but the lack of consideration for the foundational elements needed to fully utilize it is a challenge.

## Advice

Antelope Audio products are highly attractive for users seeking top-class sound quality in their price range, thanks to their outstanding AD/DA conversion performance and clocking technology. The Synergy Core platform's low-latency real-time effects can significantly improve recording workflows. However, prospective buyers must fully understand the risks associated with software and driver stability. While suitable for users proficient in PC setup and capable of some troubleshooting, or for studios prioritizing sound quality above all, those in professional environments requiring plug-and-play absolute stability are strongly advised to compare with more established competitors like RME or Universal Audio.
