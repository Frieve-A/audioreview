## Overview

Playback Designs is a Swiss digital playback equipment manufacturer founded by Andreas Koch. Koch began his career at Studer ReVox in 1982 and is known as the engineer who designed the world's first completely asynchronous digital audio sample rate converter. He is also the developer of the Sonoma DSD recording system. The company produces high-end CD/SACD players and DACs including the MPS-8, MPS-X, and MPD-8, featuring proprietary technologies such as PLINK optical fiber transmission technology and PDFAS technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Detailed measurements by Stereophile have revealed serious problems with the MPS-5. Despite using 24-bit PCM or DSD data, the noise floor remains at 16-bit equivalent performance, with the left channel having more noise than the right channel. Frequency response shows degradation at sampling rates above 96kHz, dropping -0.5dB at 20kHz and -3dB at 32kHz (96kHz) or 51kHz (192kHz). CD playback exhibits channel balance issues with the right channel being 0.2dB lower than the left. The noise level is so high that the -120dBFS dither tone is masked by noise, representing a significant deviation from transparency levels and causing scientifically audible degradation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Andreas Koch's technical background and experience at Studer ReVox, along with his achievement in developing the world's first asynchronous sample rate converter, are commendable. The proprietary PLINK optical fiber transmission technology uses high-quality, low-jitter Laser ST optical fiber interfaces, applying technology typically used in communication links. PDFAS technology for digital input buffering and clock jitter reduction, along with FPGA chips and independent power supply designs in the MPD-8 and MPS-8, represent advanced technical approaches. However, there are questions about practical technical capability as these sophisticated technologies are not reflected in measurement results.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Compared to the MPS-8's price of 28,500 USD, the Sony UBP-X800M2 (328 USD) offers equivalent or superior functionality and performance. The calculation is 328 ÷ 28,500 ≈ 0.0115. For the MPS-X at 11,500 USD, the same comparison yields 328 ÷ 11,500 ≈ 0.0285. The average of these calculations for the representative products is approximately 0.02, resulting in a score of 0.0. While positioned at premium prices as dedicated audio equipment, the functions and performance are within the range that can be substituted by general-purpose equipment combinations, failing to demonstrate advantages commensurate with the price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a small specialist manufacturer, the company reportedly conducts individual measurement and final listening tests on products. However, specific data on failure rates, MTBF, and detailed warranty information are limited. Regarding firmware update support, while products with streaming capabilities like the Stream-X2 option are supported, there is insufficient clear information about update frequency and long-term support structure. This is presumed to be at industry average levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The scientific approach of emphasizing measurements and testing each unit before shipment is commendable. However, the practice of relying on subjective listening for final quality judgment lacks consistency. The DSD-focused design philosophy also shows no confirmed advantages in objective comparison with the latest multi-bit DACs. While investment in proprietary technology is technically interesting, the sound quality improvement effects proven by measurements are limited, raising questions about the rationality relative to high costs. Additionally, considering the possibility of substitution with general-purpose equipment, the rationality of existing as dedicated equipment is judged to be low.

## Advice

While Playback Designs products may be an interesting choice for music enthusiasts attracted to Andreas Koch's technical background and proprietary technologies, they are difficult to recommend from objective performance and cost perspectives. Against the 28,500 USD MPS-8, the 328 USD Sony UBP-X800M2 offers equivalent or superior functionality with expected measurement performance advantages. Furthermore, PC + high-performance DAC combinations can build a comprehensive music playback environment including streaming capabilities with less investment. If considering a purchase, we recommend prioritizing actual measurement data and objective comparisons with other manufacturers' products over brand value or technical philosophy. Particularly regarding noise floor and frequency response issues, please make your decision with full understanding that these may have audible impacts on actual music playback.
