## Overview

German Physiks has manufactured omnidirectional loudspeakers since 1992, built around its proprietary DDD (Dicks Dipole Driver) technology and hand assembly in Germany. The company positions its portfolio as ultra-wide-bandwidth, 360° radiators covering most of the audible band from a single driver, e.g., HRS-130 (29Hz–24kHz, 87dB sensitivity, manufacturer) and Unicorn MK II (40Hz–24kHz, 88dB, manufacturer) [1][2]. The DDD driver emphasizes low moving mass (<3g, manufacturer) to achieve high transient performance [3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Public, lab-grade third-party measurements (e.g., Klippel NFS/SPIN data, comprehensive THD vs SPL, directivity plots) for German Physiks models remain scarce. Manufacturer specifications for HRS-130 list 29Hz–24kHz and ~87dB sensitivity; Unicorn MK II lists 40Hz–24kHz and 88dB [1][2]. Without independently verified frequency-response linearity, distortion, or directivity datasets, we cannot confirm transparent-level performance thresholds. Given the limited external data, the score stays at the baseline 0.5 pending credible third-party measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The DDD driver is a distinctive omnidirectional radiator derived from Walsh-type principles, implemented with very low moving mass (<3g) and broad operating range claims [3]. Build practices include hand assembly (about six hours per driver) and 96-hour pre-aging before final QC, indicating significant process rigor [7]. While the concept builds on historical Walsh work, the sustained in-house engineering and execution merit an above-average 0.7 rather than breakthrough 0.9–1.0.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

We compare against the **cheapest equivalent-or-better** product in user-visible function (omnidirectional radiation) with sufficiently strong published specs. **Ohm Walsh 3000 Tall** provides true omnidirectional/Walsh-type dispersion and manufacturer-published performance claims at **2,700 USD each (5,400 USD per pair)** [9][10]. Using HRS-130 as the representative model at **22,500 USD** (typical retail for high-polish finish) [5][6], the CP calculation is:

**5,400 USD ÷ 22,500 USD = 0.24 → 0.2 (rounded to one decimal place).**

Given the lack of authoritative independent measurements for both brands, this remains a **provisional** comparison grounded in manufacturer specs and published pricing. Result: 0.2.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

German Physiks builds in Germany, states rigorous QC (including pre-aging), and offers a **5-year warranty** on the HRS-130 per published materials [4][7]. Distribution/support infrastructure includes an appointed U.S. distributor (Locrian Audio), indicating established channel support [8]. Exotic parts (DDD driver) may increase service dependency on authorized channels, but overall signals are positive, justifying 0.8.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Targeting uniform 360° radiation directly addresses seat-to-seat consistency and room-interaction issues inherent to narrow directivity speakers. Pursuing wide bandwidth from a single driver reduces crossover interactions in the mid/treble. The portfolio’s focus on functional acoustic benefits (dispersion uniformity, phase behavior) over cosmetics aligns with scientifically motivated design goals. Despite limited public measurements, the **direction** of the engineering is rational and ambitious; thus 0.9.

## Advice

German Physiks suits listeners who specifically value room-filling, omnidirectional presentation and are willing to trade traditional pin-point imaging for enveloping sound. Audition in your room is essential. If you want **measured, neutral performance at far lower cost** (though not omnidirectional), consider well-documented alternatives like **KEF LS50 Meta** (1,599 USD per pair; abundant third-party measurements) [11][12]. If omnidirectional radiation is the non-negotiable requirement at a lower budget, **Ohm Walsh 3000 Tall** is the most economical current path we could verify [9][10].
