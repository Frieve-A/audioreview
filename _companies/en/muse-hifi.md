## Overview

MUSE HiFi Acoustic Laboratory entered the audiophile market in 2022, initially focusing on planar magnetic in-ear monitors before expanding to portable DAC/amplifier products. Despite being a newcomer, the company has developed a diverse product lineup including the Power planar magnetic IEM, and several portable DAC/amp units ranging from the entry-level M1 to the tube-equipped M5 Ultra. Their products utilize contemporary DAC chips from Cirrus Logic and ESS Sabre, with some models incorporating Bluetooth connectivity and balanced output configurations.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The M3 II demonstrates exceptional measured performance with THD+N of -103dB at 4.4mm/4Vrms and -100dB at 3.5mm/2Vrms, significantly exceeding transparent levels [1]. Signal-to-noise ratio reaches 130dB and 125dB respectively, well above the 105dB threshold for transparency. Output impedance remains below 1Ω for both single-ended and balanced outputs, ensuring proper headphone driving capability. The unit maintains flat frequency response up to 40kHz with only slight attenuation below 20Hz. However, the Power IEM exhibits a U-shaped frequency response with elevated bass and treble, deviating from neutral reproduction [2]. Limited measured data exists for other products in the lineup, preventing comprehensive evaluation of the entire range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

MUSE HiFi employs standard off-the-shelf DAC implementations using Cirrus Logic CS43131, ESS ES9038Q2M, and Realtek ALC5686 chips without significant proprietary innovation. The M5 Ultra incorporates American Raytheon JAN6419 vacuum tubes in a hybrid design, but this appears marketing-driven rather than performance-focused [3]. Contemporary Bluetooth implementations include Qualcomm QCC5125 with LDAC and aptX support, meeting current industry standards. The company demonstrates competent engineering in product execution but lacks cutting-edge technical developments or patent technology that would differentiate their offerings from standard OEM/ODM approaches prevalent in portable audio.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The M3 II, equipped with dual CS43131 DAC chips, 3.5mm and 4.4mm outputs, and PCM 32bit/384kHz support, faces direct competition from the FiiO KA11. The KA11 provides equivalent functionality with the same CS43131 DAC chip, supporting PCM 32bit/384kHz and DSD256, plus 3.5mm output with 245mW power at 16Ω and SNR of 125dB [4]. At 29.99 USD versus the M3 II's 169 USD price point, the calculation yields CP = 29.99 USD ÷ 169 USD = 0.177 ≈ 0.2. The FiiO KA11 offers equivalent USB DAC functionality with comparable measured performance at less than one-fifth the price, making MUSE HiFi products severely overpriced for their measured capabilities.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

MUSE HiFi provides standard one-year warranty coverage for labor and parts, falling below the typical two-year industry average [5]. B-grade and refurbished items receive only three months of warranty coverage. Support infrastructure relies primarily on dealer-based systems through retailers like HiFiGo rather than direct manufacturer support. Customers bear shipping costs for warranty claims, with retailers covering return shipping for repaired items. The company's recent market entry in 2022 provides limited historical reliability data. Simple dongle designs benefit from few moving parts, though the M5 Ultra's vacuum tube implementation introduces inherently failure-prone components requiring periodic replacement.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

MUSE HiFi demonstrates inconsistent design philosophy, alternating between measurement-focused products like the M3 II and subjective approaches exemplified by the M5 Ultra's vacuum tube implementation. The M5 Ultra incorporates expensive NOS military-grade tubes without demonstrable measurement improvements, suggesting marketing-driven rather than performance-driven development [6]. Costs do not consistently contribute to measurable performance enhancements, with premium pricing applied to products using standard chipsets available in lower-cost alternatives. The company shows mixed commitment to scientific audio reproduction principles, incorporating both evidence-based engineering and nostalgic analog elements without clear technical justification for improved measured performance.

## Advice

For consumers seeking measured audio performance, consider the M3 II's technical specifications but evaluate against more cost-effective alternatives like the FiiO KA11 before purchase. Avoid the M5 Ultra unless specifically seeking tube coloration for subjective preferences, as its premium pricing lacks objective performance justification. The Power IEM's U-shaped frequency response suits listeners preferring enhanced bass and treble rather than neutral reproduction. Given MUSE HiFi's recent market entry and limited support infrastructure, establish clear warranty understanding with retailers before purchase and consider alternatives from established manufacturers with comprehensive support networks.
