## Overview

NuPrime Audio was founded in 2014 by Jason Lim (NuForce co-founder) and focuses on Class-D amplifiers and DACs using proprietary ODC (Only Distortion Cancellation) and high-frequency switching designs. The brand earned early awards and has maintained a coherent line of compact, high-power amps and feature-rich DACs.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

- Third-party measurements exist for some legacy/entry models (e.g., **uDSD** measured at **~105 SINAD** on ASR) indicating competent baseline transparency for that class [1].  
- For current flagships like **Evolution STA**, the most detailed numbers are from the **official manual** (e.g., **THD+N 0.002% @1kHz/5W**, and **<0.005%** from **2–100W**) and product page power ratings (**230W/8Ω**), which are strong if independently confirmed [2][3].  
- Across the current lineup, comprehensive independent bench data is still sparse; therefore we start at **0.5** (policy default when modern measured performance is incomplete) and will revise if robust third-party data emerges.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

NuPrime’s **ODC** feedback scheme and **~650–700kHz**-class switching in higher models reflect above-average technical ambition. The Evolution series’ **very high input impedance** implementation (e.g., 1 MΩ in related designs) and careful power supply work are consistent with sophisticated engineering [3]. Overall, the design toolkit is original and capable.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**Method (company review):** we pick representative core categories (DAC / power amp), find the **cheapest equal-or-better** alternatives (function & measured performance from a user perspective), compute each item’s CP, then average **weighted by product importance** (DAC 40%, amp 60%).

### Representative DAC (NuPrime AMG DAC)

- **What the user gets:** balanced DAC with **one analog stereo input** (works as a simple pre), PCM **384 kHz** / **DSD256**, full remoteable desktop form factor [4].  
- **Price (new)**: **1,999 USD** (multiple current dealers) [5][6][7].

**Cheapest equal-or-better alternative (function + measurements):**  
- **Topping E70 Velvet (E70V)** balanced DAC (**AK4499EX**), very low THD+N with independent lab data (L7Audiolab) plus modern I/O; **but no analog input** → pair with **Topping Pre90** preamp to match the AMG DAC’s analog-in use-case.  
  - **E70V**: **349 USD** (ShenzenAudio current list) [8]. Independent measurements available [9].  
  - **Pre90**: **599 USD** (official store) [10].  
  - **Total**: **948 USD**.  
- **Equivalence note:** Balanced outputs; excellent low-distortion conversion (**E70V** independently measured); adding **Pre90** restores analog input and volume/pre functions.  
- **CP (DAC)** = 948 ÷ 1,999 = **0.47** → **0.47**.

### Representative Power Amplifier (NuPrime Evolution STA)

- **What the user gets:** stereo power amp, **230 W/8Ω**, dual-mono implementation, low stated THD+N; high-end build [2][3].  
- **Price (new)**: **4,995 USD** (current dealers) [6][11][12].

**Cheapest equal-or-better alternative (user-visible output & measured linearity):**  
- **Purifi-based 2-ch amps**, e.g., **Buckeye 1ET6525SA (2-channel)** at **1,150 USD** [13], using Purifi modules in the same performance class as the widely measured **1ET400A** implementations (multiple ASR reviews show state-of-the-art distortion/noise and very high power into 4/8Ω) [14][15].  
- **Equivalence note:** From a user perspective: ample clean power into real loads and benchmark-level THD+N/IMD. Multiple independent bench tests validate Purifi stereo builds’ transparency at or beyond what NuPrime claims.  
- **CP (Amp)** = 1,150 ÷ 4,995 = **0.23** → **0.23**.

**Weighted company CP:** 0.4×0.47 + 0.6×0.23 = **0.33** → Rounded to **0.3** (display step).

> **Result:** Cheaper routes to **equal-or-better** transparency exist today for both a balanced DAC/pre chain and a powerful low-distortion stereo power amp. NuPrime’s pricing remains the primary weakness.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

- Global distribution and 2-year coverage (region-dependent).  
- **Service policy** includes a **prepaid 75 USD diagnostic** step before repairs (disclosed on support pages) [16][17].  
- Documentation quality is generally good (manuals with concrete specs). Boutique scale and limited in-house service depth vs. larger vendors keep this shy of higher scores.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Strong engineering aims (ODC, high-freq switching) are rational toward transparency, but the **price-to-measurement** proposition lags behind the market’s cheapest transparent alternatives. Without sustained third-party verification showing audible-meaningful superiority, premiums look hard to justify.

## Advice

If you like NuPrime’s industrial design and want a compact, high-power stack from one brand, their amps and DACs can deliver transparent playback. For **pure value**, however, a **Purifi-based power amp** plus a **modern measured DAC/pre** remains the objectively cheaper path to the same audible transparency.
