summary: "American veteran cable manufacturer that centers design around 'golden ratio' and 'litz structure.' Pursues natural, musical sound based on unique philosophy. While earning high trust through quality and lifetime warranty, products are expensive with design philosophy heavily reflecting proprietary concepts rather than scientific foundation."

## Overview

Cardas Audio is an Oregon-based audio cable and accessory manufacturer founded by George Cardas in 1987. Their products are built around "Golden Section Stranding" technology, which applies the "golden ratio (1:1.618)" found throughout nature to conductor twisting. This allegedly eliminates internal cable resonances and cancels noise. They also actively employ "Litz structure," bundling individually insulated fine conductors to reduce skin effect. Their sound is often described as "warm and musical," earning support from numerous audiophiles over the years.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Among Cardas's adopted technologies, "Litz structure" reducing skin effect is an established electrical engineering fact. However, whether its effect decisively influences sound quality in audible frequency bands (~20kHz) remains debatable. Meanwhile, the core design claim that "golden ratio" suppresses cable resonance is proprietary theory lacking universal scientific validation. While some scientifically-based technologies are adopted, the magnitude of their effects and golden ratio effectiveness remain unproven, limiting evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Technical capability to manufacture complex geometry conductors based on golden ratio is acknowledged. However, this represents "sound shaping" technology to create specific acoustic characteristics (character) rather than "high fidelity reproduction." Litz structure adoption has some rationality as skin effect countermeasure, but effects in audio bands are limited. Intentionally giving cables complex structures under the pretext of resonance control may compromise signal purity, preventing high evaluation from high fidelity perspectives.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Cardas cables are positioned in high-end markets with expensive pricing. For example, their flagship Clear series speaker cables reach several hundred thousand yen. From pure signal transmission performance perspectives, comparing with professional cables (Belden, Mogami, etc.) costing mere thousands of yen with equivalent or superior measurement characteristics, the price difference greatly exceeds performance differences. Since brand value and proprietary design philosophy constitute the majority of pricing, cost-performance evaluation is low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Cardas Audio is a reputable brand with long history, known for high-quality materials and careful construction. Offering lifetime warranties on many products demonstrates confidence in their products. Stable support can be expected through worldwide authorized dealer networks. Considering physical robustness and long-term warranty systems, reliability is evaluated as high.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Focusing on issues like skin effect and resonance is rational, but introducing scientifically weak "golden ratio" as solution deviates from pursuing high fidelity reproduction. This represents brand philosophy and storytelling methods rather than pure engineering approaches. The resulting "musical sound" is essentially a form of "coloration" to the source, incompatible with high fidelity ideals of transmitting source information as-is, limiting rationality evaluation.

## Advice

Cardas Audio cables are effective as "sound shaping" tools that give systems specific characteristics like warmth and richness. However, understand this may differ from source-faithful reproduction. If prioritizing absolute fidelity - "high fidelity reproduction" - consider simpler professional cables with guaranteed objective performance. Choosing Cardas products means investing in empathy with their unique sound philosophy and aesthetics.
