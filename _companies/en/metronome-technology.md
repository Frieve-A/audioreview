## Overview

Metronome Technology is a high-end audio equipment manufacturer established in 1987 by Dominique Giner in France. Since 2014, Jean-Marie Clauzel has taken over the company, headquartered in Montan near Toulouse, manufacturing CD players, DACs, and streamers by hand for over 30 years. The company's products are marketed under two brands, Metronome and Kalista, featuring handcrafted assembly by French artisans. Main products include the AQWO 2 series (17,800-25,500 GBP), Le Player 4 (8,900 USD), and Le DAC 2 (8,000 USD), all featuring high-quality DAC chips such as ESS ES9038Pro and AK4493, supporting 32-bit/384kHz PCM and DSD512.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The technical specifications of the company's products are at a standard level for modern high-end audio equipment. The AQWO 2 features an ESS ES9038Pro DAC supporting 32-bit/384kHz PCM and DSD512, while Le Player 4 adopts a dual-mono configuration supporting 32-bit/384kHz and DSD512. XLR and RCA outputs are set to 3Vrms (47kΩ and 600Ω), providing appropriate output levels. Power supply designs using multiple toroidal transformers and 10 independent voltage regulation lines may contribute to reducing harmonic distortion. However, specific measurement data for THD+N, S/N ratio, and frequency response are not publicly available, making it unclear whether transparency levels are achieved. While excellent performance can be expected from the DAC chip specifications, verification through actual measurements is necessary.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The technical sophistication is at a high level, featuring handcrafted manufacturing in France, adoption of high-quality DAC chips, and power supply design with multiple toroidal transformers. Le DAC's weight of 14kg indicates consideration for substantial power circuits and mechanical stability. Investment in mechanical precision is evident through the adoption of SUOS-HiFi custom CD mechanisms, sliding doors, and pack fixing systems. Support for 32-bit/384kHz and DSD512 adapts to modern high-resolution formats, and transport functionality via I²S over HDMI output is technically appropriate. However, these technologies are basically combinations of existing high-quality components, with no groundbreaking proprietary technology development observed. While the technology level exceeds industry average, it cannot be considered cutting-edge technological innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The company's pricing is extremely overpriced. As a product with equivalent functionality to Le Player 4 (8,900 USD), Sony UBP-X800M2 (300 USD) exists. Sony includes SACD playback, DSD 11.2MHz support, 4K Blu-ray playback, streaming functionality, USB DAC function, and additionally incorporates 4K video playback and streaming apps like Netflix as a multifunctional product. It significantly excels not only in audio functions but also in video functions. Price comparison yields 300÷8,900=0.034, meaning Metronome products offer equivalent functionality at approximately 30 times the price. The AQWO 2 series is even more expensive at 17,800-25,500 GBP, making this price difference completely unjustifiable. Even considering the added value of French handcrafting, the performance-to-price ratio is at the lowest level.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As a company established in 1987 with over 30 years of track record, there is a sufficient reliability foundation. Handcrafted manufacturing at the French headquarters is an appreciable element from a quality control perspective. Products are tested under actual listening conditions, showing consideration for quality assurance. Global dealer expansion is conducted with support systems established in major markets including Japan. However, specific reliability data such as failure rates and MTBF are not publicly available, and details about warranty periods and repair systems are unclear. While there is reassurance in terms of track record compared to emerging manufacturers, it cannot be said to have industry-leading support systems. This is a product category requiring continuous firmware updates, but the frequency of such support and long-term support policies remain unclear.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While steadily executing traditional high-end audio approaches, there are questions about modern rationality. High-quality DAC chips, substantial power circuits, and pursuit of mechanical precision are appreciable directions contributing to sound quality improvement. Quality control through French handcrafting also has certain rationality. However, the rationale for setting exorbitant prices as dedicated audio equipment is unclear. Le Player 4's functionality can be realized more affordably through smartphone + external DAC/amp combinations, making the necessity as dedicated equipment weak. Additionally, the stance of emphasizing "musicality" without publishing measurement data cannot be considered a scientific approach. The balance between technology investment and pricing is not maintained, making the rationality of design philosophy limited.

## Advice

Those considering purchasing Metronome Technology products are strongly recommended to first compare with Sony UBP-X800M2 (300 USD), which offers equivalent functionality. Particularly when SACD playback and high-resolution support are needed, Sony provides equivalent or superior functionality plus 4K video playback at 1/30th the price. Please calmly judge whether the added value of French handcrafting is worth 30 times the price difference. Additionally, CD transport + external DAC configurations (e.g., Cambridge Audio CXC + high-quality DAC) enable more flexible and affordable system construction. While Metronome products are certainly high-quality, they are extremely overpriced from a price-to-performance perspective, and it's important not to neglect consideration of alternative products even when budget allows. Before purchase, always confirm actual measurement data and conduct comparative listening tests with multiple products to carefully evaluate whether there are sound quality improvement effects worth the price.
