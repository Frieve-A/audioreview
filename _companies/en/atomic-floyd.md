summary: "A hybrid driver earphone with titanium construction, but features severe audio quality issues including a sharp resonance peak around 10kHz and midrange recession. At its launch price of 399 USD, modern hybrid earphones costing around 30 USD offer equivalent or superior performance, resulting in extremely poor cost-performance."

## Overview

The Atomic Floyd SuperDarts Titanium is a hybrid driver in-ear earphone released around 2014 by UK-based audio manufacturer Atomic Floyd. It features a hybrid configuration combining a 9mm dynamic driver with a balanced armature driver, housed in a lightweight titanium construction (2.8g per side). The product claimed a wide frequency response of 5Hz-40kHz and garnered attention for its advanced hybrid design and premium materials at the time. However, subsequent measurement evaluations have revealed serious frequency response issues.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Multiple measurement reviews have confirmed that the SuperDarts Titanium suffers from significant frequency response problems. The most serious issue is a sharp resonance peak around 10kHz, which causes sibilance (excessive emphasis of sibilant sounds) and listening fatigue. Additionally, there is a recession across the entire midrange, severely compromising the fundamental tonal balance of music. These measurement results clearly indicate audible degradation in sound quality when considered against human auditory characteristics. Compared to modern measurement standards (a transparent level of 20Hz-20kHz ±0.5dB), this product shows deviations far exceeding the problematic level (±3.0dB or greater), resulting in extremely low scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The adoption of a hybrid driver design and lightweight titanium construction represented technically ambitious efforts for 2014. The approach of combining a 9mm dynamic driver with a balanced armature for wide-band reproduction and acoustic optimization through titanium materials showed some technical rationale. However, there are clear design failures in the crossover implementation and tuning, preventing the realization of the intended acoustic performance. By current technical standards, modern hybrid earphones priced around 30 USD (such as the KZ ZSN Pro X) achieve superior frequency response, placing this product's technical level below average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The SuperDarts Titanium's launch price was approximately 399 USD, while modern hybrid driver earphones offering equivalent or superior functionality and performance include the KZ ZSN Pro X at 30 USD. The KZ ZSN Pro X features a 10mm dynamic + 30095 balanced armature configuration and achieves a far superior frequency response compared to the SuperDarts Titanium. The cost-performance is calculated as "30 USD ÷ 399 USD = 0.075," which rounds to 0.1. This result indicates that the SuperDarts Titanium is approximately 13 times more expensive than products with equivalent functionality, demonstrating extremely poor cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As of 2025, Atomic Floyd's official website is still online, and the company remains registered as an active entity. The website mentions a 2-year manufacturer warranty and provides a customer support contact. However, there is no evidence of new product launches or active website updates in recent years, and the current level of support responsiveness is unclear. UK company records also indicate that its accounts are overdue. This lack of recent activity and transparency raises questions about long-term reliability, resulting in a below-average rating.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The concept of a hybrid driver configuration and titanium construction represented a rational approach toward the clear objectives of weight reduction and wide-band reproduction. However, there are fatal issues in the actual acoustic tuning. The resonance peak around 10kHz is clearly a design error that significantly compromises the product's fundamental music reproduction capability. Selling a product with such a defect, which is easily avoidable using modern measurement techniques and tuning methods, at a high price calls the rationality of the design philosophy into question. This can be seen as a result of neglecting the importance of scientific, measurement-based tuning.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing the SuperDarts Titanium, we strongly recommend examining modern alternatives. For a hybrid driver configuration, the KZ ZSN Pro X (30 USD) or KZ ZSN Pro 2 (50 USD) offer equivalent or superior technical functionality at significantly lower prices. These products feature a better-adjusted frequency response and do not have the fatal defects found in the SuperDarts Titanium, such as the 10kHz resonance peak and midrange recession. Even for those with a higher budget, modern designs like the Sennheiser IE 600 (700 USD) deliver far superior performance for actual music listening. While the titanium construction offers material appeal, the fundamental audio quality issues make this product difficult to recommend.
