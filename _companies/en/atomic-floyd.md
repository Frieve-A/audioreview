## Overview

Atomic Floyd is a British manufacturer specializing in high-performance in-ear headphones. In the 2010s, they developed premium earphones with the concept of "metal construction for a lifetime," using titanium and stainless steel housings. Their flagship products featured hybrid driver configurations and were marketed with claims of Swiss watch-like precision and high-end audio quality. However, serious issues have been identified in their acoustic designs.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

In flagship products like the SuperDarts Titanium, measurements have confirmed severe frequency response issues, including a sharp resonance peak around 10kHz and a midrange recession. This characteristic induces sibilance and listening fatigue, significantly disrupting the fundamental tonal balance of music. This is a major deviation from transparent sound reproduction, resulting in an extremely low rating for scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the adoption of hybrid drivers and titanium housings was ambitious for the 2010s, there were clear failures in the acoustic engineering to support them, particularly in the crossover and tuning implementation. As a result, the intended acoustic performance was not achieved. Since more affordable modern earphones offer far superior characteristics, the company's technology level is below average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The flagship SuperDarts Titanium was launched at 399 USD, whereas a current product with equivalent or superior performance, the "KZ ZSN Pro X," is available for 23.99 USD. The cost-performance is calculated as 23.99 USD รท 399 USD = 0.060, resulting in a score of 0.1. This indicates it is more than 10 times more expensive than products with equivalent functionality, demonstrating poor cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Although the official website and legal entity still exist as of 2025, the website has not been updated for years, and UK company records indicate overdue accounts. While a 24-month warranty was offered in the past, the current support system is considered effectively defunct, raising serious concerns about long-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While the direction of using premium materials is rational in itself, the decision to sell products at a high price while leaving fatal flaws like the 10kHz resonance peak, a result of neglecting scientific measurement in acoustic design, is irrational. The design philosophy, which prioritized marketing elements like materials and appearance over the essential value of sound quality, lacks rationality.

## Advice

Purchasing any Atomic Floyd product is not recommended for any reason. The company's products have fatal flaws in sound quality, and corporate support is nonexistent. If you are looking for hybrid earphones, products like the "KZ ZSN Pro X" (23.99 USD) or "Moondrop Chu II" (18.99 USD) are overwhelmingly cheaper and of higher quality. These products do not have the issues that plague Atomic Floyd and are superior choices in every aspect.
