## Overview

CraveDSP Limited is a UK-based audio plugin developer founded by Keith Wood, a programmer and physicist with a master's degree in mathematical physics. The company produces three main audio plugins: Crave EQ (69 USD), Crave Transient EQ (138 USD), and Crave Stereo Enhancer (34 USD). Founded with a focus on "uncompromising sound quality," the company represents a small but technically-oriented developer in the competitive audio plugin market. Wood's scientific background and self-description as a "scientist and software engineer, not a professional musician" positions the company with a technical rather than artistic approach to audio processing.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. No third-party measurements or manufacturer specifications provide audio quality-relevant performance data such as frequency response accuracy, THD+N, SNR, or dynamic range. While the plugins claim "uncompromising sound quality" and "high fidelity," these are marketing claims without supporting measurement evidence. The company provides functional specifications (32 parametric bands for Crave EQ, latency specifications of 48 samples for Analog mode) but lacks the critical audio performance metrics needed for scientific evaluation. Without credible third-party measurements or detailed manufacturer specifications covering frequency response, distortion, and noise performance, the actual audio quality impact cannot be determined.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

CraveDSP demonstrates solid technical implementation with several innovative approaches. The company develops proprietary algorithms including an innovative phase suppression algorithm in the Transparent mode and a proprietary transient/stationary separation algorithm for Crave Transient EQ. The 32-band parametric EQ with four different filter models (Analog, Transparent, Digital, Linear) shows technical sophistication, particularly the hybrid approach combining analog phase modeling at lower frequencies with digital phase suppression at higher frequencies. GPU-accelerated graphics implementation and support for modern plugin formats (VST, VST3, AU, AAX) demonstrate contemporary technology adoption. However, the technology appears current rather than cutting-edge, and the small scale of development limits the potential for major technological breakthroughs compared to larger companies with greater R&D resources.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Weighted Average CP = (0.9 × 0.286) + (1.0 × 0.573) + (0.0 × 0.141) = 0.8

Cost-performance analysis evaluates all three main products with weighted average calculation. Prices converted from EUR to USD using ECB rate 1.1622 as of 2025-10-15. **Crave EQ** (69 USD): faces competition from Three-Body Technology Kirchhoff-EQ at 59.99 USD, which offers equivalent 32-band parametric EQ functionality with superior filter variety (15 vs 7 filter types) and advanced dynamics processing. CP = 59.99 USD ÷ 69 USD = 0.9. **Crave Transient EQ** (138 USD): represents the world's most affordable option with transient/stationary separation functionality, competing with Eventide SplitEQ at 179 USD which provides equivalent functionality with 8 parametric bands and structural split technology. Since no cheaper equivalent exists, CP = 1.0. **Crave Stereo Enhancer** (34 USD): faces significant competition from free alternatives including iZotope Ozone Imager and Voxengo Stereo Touch, both offering equivalent stereo imaging functionality with mono compatibility preservation. CP = 0 USD ÷ 34 USD = 0.0. Weighted by price importance: Crave EQ (28.6% weight), Crave Transient EQ (57.3% weight), Crave Stereo Enhancer (14.1% weight).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

CraveDSP provides adequate but basic support infrastructure. The company offers email support with a promise to "respond as soon as possible" and maintains a contact form for customers experiencing email difficulties. As a registered company in England and Wales with legitimate business registration, CraveDSP provides appropriate legal accountability. The software plugin format inherently provides good reliability due to simple structure without moving parts or hardware components prone to failure. Fully functional trial versions with reasonable limitations (periodic fade-out) allow users to evaluate products before purchase. However, the support infrastructure remains limited compared to larger companies, with no specific warranty periods mentioned and no established track record for long-term support reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

CraveDSP demonstrates highly rational design philosophy grounded in scientific principles. Founder Keith Wood's background in mathematical physics and self-identification as a "scientist and software engineer" establishes a measurement-focused approach to audio processing. The company's focus on "learning and improvement" and willingness to receive feedback demonstrates rational development methodology. Cost allocation appears efficient, with software plugins providing direct functional value without unnecessary physical components or premium materials. The adoption of GPU acceleration, modern digital signal processing techniques, and contemporary plugin formats shows appropriate technology integration. Advanced functional integration includes specialized algorithms for specific audio processing tasks, justifying existence as dedicated audio tools rather than generic software. The scientific approach and innovative algorithm development (phase suppression, transient separation) demonstrate rational progression toward measurable audio improvements.

## Advice

CraveDSP products suit users seeking technically sophisticated audio processing tools from a scientifically-oriented developer. Crave EQ offers comprehensive parametric EQ functionality with unique filter models, particularly valuable for users requiring the specialized Transparent mode's hybrid phase approach, though Three-Body Technology Kirchhoff-EQ provides more filter types at lower cost. Crave Transient EQ provides advanced transient/stationary separation for detailed dynamic control as the most affordable option in its category, being significantly less expensive than established alternatives like Eventide SplitEQ. Crave Stereo Enhancer faces strong competition from free alternatives including iZotope Ozone Imager, making paid options harder to justify unless specific features warrant the cost. The trial versions with periodic fade-out allow thorough evaluation before purchase. Users prioritizing proven track record and extensive support should consider established alternatives, while those valuing innovative algorithms and scientific approach will appreciate CraveDSP's technical focus. The lack of published measurement data means users must rely on subjective evaluation during trial periods.
