## Overview

United Recording Electronics Industries (UREI) was founded in 1958 by Bill Putnam Sr. within Universal Recording/United Recording, producing the 1176 Peak Limiter, the Teletronix/UREI LA-3A, and the time-aligned 813 studio monitors that became studio staples. In 1983 UREI was sold to Harman and became part of JBL Professional; the brand subsequently wound down as an active manufacturer. In 1999, Bill Putnam Jr. and Jim Putnam re-established Universal Audio, which today produces reissues of classic Universal Audio/UREI/Teletronix hardware. [4][2][1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Classic UREI-type dynamics are valued for character but fall short of modern “transparent” electronics when judged by measurements. Manufacturer specs for the Universal Audio 1176LN list frequency response 20 Hz–20 kHz (±1 dB), signal-to-noise ratio > 81 dB (no limiting), and distortion “more than 0.5% THD” with limiting. [1] The LA-3A is specified at 20 Hz–20 kHz (±0.5 dB), noise floor −80 dB (at limiting threshold), and < 0.35% THD at +24 dBm. [2] By contrast, contemporary audio interfaces reach ~129–133 dB dynamic range with THD+N below −118 dB (manufacturer data), indicating orders-of-magnitude lower distortion/noise for transparent processing. [8][9] These figures support the low scientific-validity score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

UREI advanced pro-audio technology for its time: the 1176’s FET limiting topology (1968), the LA-3A’s electro-optical T4 gain control, and the 813 monitors’ use of time-alignment (with E.M. Long Associates) were influential engineering milestones that shaped studio practice. [4][2][7] While historically important, later implementations and modern converters surpass these designs when the goal is maximum measured fidelity. [8][9]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

For a representative current “UREI-type” product, the Universal Audio 1176LN lists at 2,999 USD at major U.S. retailers. [5] The cheapest finished-product alternative with equivalent user-facing functionality (same ratio set including “all-buttons-in,” ultrafast attack 20–800 µs, comparable or lower published distortion) is Klark Teknik’s 1176-KT at 219 USD. [6] Its published features/specs confirm functional parity and typical THD+N around 0.15% (manufacturer listings/retail spec sheets). [6][10]  
**CP calculation:** 219 USD ÷ 2,999 USD = **0.073** → score rounds to **0.1**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

UREI as an independent maker ceased after the 1983 sale to Harman/JBL; official support for original UREI hardware is long ended. Maintenance depends on aging components and third-party technicians, unlike active brands with warranties/parts pipelines. [4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

UREI’s designs addressed real studio needs with rational engineering—fast FET limiting, opto level control, and time-aligned monitoring—delivering reliable professional tools for the era. However, pursuing vintage coloration over transparent accuracy is not aligned with today’s science-first fidelity goals; modern solutions achieve the same functions with markedly better measured performance. [1][2][8]

## Advice

Buy UREI-derived gear for its historic behavior/tone, not objective transparency. If you want classic 1176-style operation at minimal cost, Klark Teknik’s 1176-KT (219 USD) is the least-expensive finished product with equivalent core functions. [6] If your priority is transparent processing and highest measured fidelity, modern interfaces/converters deliver far lower distortion/noise than vintage-style hardware. [8][9]
