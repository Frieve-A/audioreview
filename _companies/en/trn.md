## Overview

TRN (Dongguan Zuodu Acoustic Technology Co., Ltd.) is a Chinese audio manufacturer established in 2017. The company specializes in In-Ear Monitor (IEM) manufacturing, bringing low-cost hybrid driver configuration products to market. TRN promotes "audio enthusiast involvement in development" and develops a product lineup combining BA (Balanced Armature) drivers with dynamic drivers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The measurement performance of TRN's product lineup is at industry average level. The representative product TRN V90 adopts a V-shaped acoustic design in its frequency response, showing boosts in low and high frequencies, but this is intentional tuning and not a critical issue. Detailed THD measurement data from third-party organizations is limited, but there are no reports of distortion levels that would be problematic in general use. S/N ratio is maintained at approximately 100dB, meeting basic performance requirements. However, from the perspective of complete fidelity to master sources, intentional acoustic characteristic adjustments deviate from neutrality. Sound quality improvement effects confirmed by measurements in the audible range are limited, and scientific validity is judged to be at standard level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While TRN actively adopts hybrid driver configurations, the technical implementation level falls below industry average. Despite promoting multi-driver configurations, crossover design optimization is insufficient, failing to fully utilize the characteristics of each driver. Upper models like BA15 and BAX Pro feature 15 BA drivers, but this is more of a marketing element than technical necessity, with questionable contribution to actual sound quality improvement. Advanced elements such as planar magnetic driver adoption are seen, but the basic design philosophy and implementation technology strongly resemble combinations of existing products, lacking originality and rationality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

TRN products are priced in the low 20-80 USD range, showing advantages in comparison with competing products of equivalent functionality. As a competing product with equivalent hybrid configuration (4BA+1DD) to the representative product TRN V90 (approximately 45 USD), KZ ZS10 Pro (approximately 40 USD) exists. Calculation formula: 40 USD รท 45 USD = 0.89, resulting in a cost-performance score of 0.9. TRN provides hybrid driver configurations at low prices, maintaining price competitiveness even when compared to products with equivalent 5-driver (4BA+1DD) configurations. However, there is room for improvement in measurement performance, and enhancement in sound quality aspects is necessary to achieve higher evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

As an emerging manufacturer established in 2017, long-term reliability track record is insufficient. While providing a standard 1-year warranty period, support structure outside mainland China is limited. Product quality shows variation, with some user reviews reporting initial defects and durability issues. Though not applicable to product categories requiring firmware updates, instances falling below industry standards in hardware quality control are frequently observed. Repair structure is also unclear, and after-sales support quality is judged to be near industry minimum standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

TRN's design philosophy contains numerous irrational elements. The policy of "intentionally enhancing low-frequency excitement" deviates from the scientific perspective of fidelity to master sources. Despite adopting multi-driver configurations, it does not contribute to achieving the transparent level in measurement result standards. Particularly, models featuring 15 BA drivers have strong marketing elements rather than technical necessity, lacking rationality. New models show no improvement in problem-level measurement results, and rather adopt intentional V-shaped frequency characteristics, showing clear deviation from scientific sound quality improvement direction. Compared to general-purpose devices (smartphone + external DAC), advantages as dedicated equipment are limited, and rationality of design philosophy is evaluated as low.

## Advice

For those considering purchasing TRN products, we recommend comparative examination with alternative products having equivalent hybrid configurations. Particularly, KZ ZS10 Pro and CCA C10 show superior measurement performance with the same 4BA+1DD hybrid configuration, demonstrating advantages in fidelity to master sources. If selecting TRN products, we recommend limiting use primarily to entertainment purposes, understanding the bass-heavy sound quality characteristics. For audiophile use or accurate music reproduction, it is important to select products with superior measurement performance. Additionally, considering support structure limitations, it is necessary to recognize that they may not be suitable for long-term use.
