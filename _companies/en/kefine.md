summary: "Kefine is a young Chinese brand focused on value-first IEMs. The lineup centers on single-DD and planar sets with simple, modular features (interchangeable nozzles, detachable cables). Public third-party measurements remain sparse, so our scoring leans on confirmed specifications and market analysis. Warranty is typically routed via dealers (e.g., Linsoul)."

## Overview

Kefine is a China-based brand that states its mission is to deliver “refined audio products… at the best value” and even explains the name’s origin (“Ke” + “refine”) on its official site [1]. The current catalog focuses on wired IEMs: the Klean (single DD, interchangeable nozzles), Delci (single DD), Klanar (14.5 mm planar), and Quatio (2DD+2BA hybrid). Representative market prices at launch/MSRP include: Klean 49 USD, Delci 75 USD, Klanar 119 USD, Quatio 129.99 USD [2][7][8][9]. Overall, the company pursues pragmatic feature sets and modest pricing rather than heavy marketing or boutique builds.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent lab measurements for Kefine models are limited as of this review. Using the Klean as a representative, manufacturer-/retailer-published specs show 20 Hz–20 kHz FR (effective), 107 dB sensitivity, and 32 Ω impedance, with a detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable [3]. These numbers are typical for modern budget IEMs, but do not by themselves demonstrate audibly superior performance versus the best transparent targets. Until more third-party data (FR curves, THD/IMD, unit variance) is available, we score from the 0.5 baseline per policy and will revise when rigorous measurements appear.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Kefine’s designs emphasize established approaches (single dynamic drivers with DLC diaphragms, simple crossovers, interchangeable nozzles). These are sensible, but not cutting-edge. We do not find public claims of proprietary patents or unique DSP frameworks; most features align with the broader budget-IEM field [1][2][3]. Implementation quality (metal shells, modular nozzles) is decent for the price tier, yet there’s no clear technical leadership over peers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

We compute CP using the **cheapest equivalent-or-better** option on the market and the brand’s most representative model (Kefine **Klean**, 49 USD market price) as the denominator [2].  
**Comparator:** **MOONDROP CHU II**—10 mm DD, detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable, published effective FR 20 Hz–20 kHz (IEC60318-4), sensitivity 119 dB/Vrms, THD ≤ 0.5 % @ 1 kHz/94 dB; functionally equivalent for typical users and with adequate measured specs [5][6].  
**Price basis:** 22.99 USD (official MOONDROP site), 49 USD (Linsoul) [6][2].  
**Calculation (display rule):** 22.99 USD ÷ 49 USD = **0.469** → CP score **0.5** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a newer brand, long-term failure data is scarce. Warranty and service are typically handled by retailers/distributors; for example, Linsoul lists **1-year** coverage for IEMs and **3-month** for cables/adapters [4]. This is industry-standard at the budget level. No evidence of extended firmware support is required (wired IEM category). With limited historical RMA data, we anchor at an average 0.5.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Kefine focuses on cost-controlled builds and familiar driver tech, which is rational for value seekers. However, without public, repeatable measurements demonstrating audibly transparent performance or novel engineering that advances the state of the art, the philosophy reads as conservative and me-too. The emphasis is on affordability rather than measurable breakthroughs [1][2][3].

## Advice

If you want a safe, low-cost wired IEM, Kefine models are viable—especially if you like interchangeable nozzles for subtle tonality tweaks (Klean). For **maximum value**, cross-shop the CHU II and similar budget standouts; they offer equivalent functionality and well-documented specs at lower prices [5][6]. If you’re after measurable step-ups (documented FR linearity, low THD across SPL, unit consistency), wait for third-party data on newer Kefine releases or consider models with robust independent measurements. For planar curiosity (Klanar), compare against established planars around 100–130 USD before deciding [8].
