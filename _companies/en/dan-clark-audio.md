## Overview

$$ \Large \text{4.0} $$

Dan Clark Audio, founded as MrSpeakers in 2012 and rebranded in 2019, specializes in planar magnetic headphones with headquarters in San Diego, California. The company holds six patents for proprietary technologies including V-Planar driver design and Acoustic Metamaterial Tuning System (AMTS). Their flagship products, the closed-back STEALTH and open-back EXPANSE, both priced at 3,999 USD, represent the company's pursuit of measurement-based audio excellence. Founded by electrical engineer Dan Clark, the company has earned recognition from Audio Science Review as setting new standards for headphone measurement compliance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Dan Clark Audio demonstrates exceptional measured performance across flagship models. The STEALTH and EXPANSE achieve THD below 0.03% (20-20kHz at 94dB), significantly exceeding the transparent level of 0.05% for headphones [1]. Third-party measurements show the EXPANSE reaching 86 dB SINAD, surpassing the 80 dB transparent threshold [2]. Audio Science Review noted the EXPANSE shows "best compliance to target of any open-back headphone tested" with distortion "limited by measurement noise rather than true headphone distortion" [2]. Group delay measurements reveal clean performance unlike typical headphones with messy phase characteristics [3]. These results place Dan Clark Audio products significantly above transparent levels across multiple critical measurement criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company maintains sophisticated proprietary technology through six patents covering key innovations. US Patent 9,854,364 protects V-Planar technology developed with Bruce Thigpen, involving diaphragm creasing for improved linearity [4]. Patent 17849432 covers the Acoustic Metamaterial Tuning System integrating waveguides, diffusion control, and resonators into compact structures [4]. Additional patents protect TrueFlow turbulence reduction, titanium hingeless headband design, and 3D printed double-walled cups [5]. The 4th generation driver represents 20% larger surface area with uniform tension control achieving better than 0.25dB driver matching [6]. This patent portfolio and continuous innovation demonstrate high technical sophistication with 3+ year competitive advantages.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

At 3,999 USD, the STEALTH and EXPANSE represent the world's cheapest products achieving their level of measured performance and functions. Comparable planar magnetic headphones with equivalent measured performance include the HiFiMAN Susvara (6,000 USD current market price) and Audeze LCD-5 (4,500 USD), both more expensive. No cheaper equivalent exists with the same measured performance specifications, therefore CP = 1.0. The Dan Clark products offer planar magnetic technology, proprietary V-Planar and AMTS systems, THD below 0.03%, SINAD of 86 dB, and best-in-class frequency response compliance. No cheaper alternatives exist with equivalent measured performance across these specifications, making Dan Clark Audio the most cost-effective option in this performance category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Dan Clark Audio offers robust planar magnetic construction with inherently reliable design due to fewer moving parts. However, customer service concerns significantly impact this evaluation. Reports from 2020 indicate response issues with customers unable to contact the company for service [7]. The warranty excludes normal wear including ear pad compression and finish scratches, with repair primarily through resellers for international customers [8]. The 15-day return policy applies only to direct website purchases of new headphones [8]. While the physical construction demonstrates reliability through planar magnetic technology, the limited support infrastructure and reported customer service issues reduce confidence in long-term ownership experience.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Dan Clark Audio demonstrates exemplary scientifically rational design philosophy focused exclusively on measurable performance improvements. Audio Science Review praised their measurement-focused development approach, stating "companies that do their homework during development smell like roses in my reviews" [9]. The company designs products to comply with established target curves like the Harman response, showing unwavering commitment to scientific standards [9]. Each generation exhibits quantifiable improvements in THD, driver size, and frequency response rather than subjective claims, with all technical advances supported by verifiable measurements. The AMTS technology integrates multiple acoustic principles into functional improvements rather than marketing-driven features. Cost allocation directly contributes to performance enhancement through proprietary driver technology and acoustic engineering rather than cosmetic elements, representing optimal rationality in design philosophy with complete elimination of non-scientific approaches.

## Advice

Dan Clark Audio represents an excellent choice for audiophiles prioritizing measured performance and scientific approach to headphone design. The STEALTH and EXPANSE offer world-class measured performance at competitive pricing within their performance tier. However, potential buyers should consider customer service limitations and warranty restrictions before purchase. For critical listening applications requiring low distortion and accurate frequency response, these products deliver exceptional value. International customers should verify local dealer support before purchase due to reported service challenges. The company's measurement-focused philosophy makes their products ideal for users who appreciate objective audio engineering over subjective claims.
