## Overview

Dan Clark Audio (formerly MrSpeakers) is a planar magnetic headphone specialist founded in 2012 by Dan Clark in the United States. The founder, Dan Clark, is a former engineer at Apple, Compaq, and Sun Microsystems, bringing 30 years of high-tech industry experience and acoustic engineering expertise to headphone development. In the late 1990s, he also worked as a loudspeaker design consultant for high-end audio companies and was involved in developing the Platinum Audio series 2 speakers. Starting with the world's first 3D-printed headphones "Alpha Dog," the company has gained high acclaim with its AEON, Stealth, and Expanse series featuring proprietary V-planar technology and AMTS (Acoustic Metamaterial Tuning System).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Dan Clark Audio products demonstrate exceptionally excellent measured performance. Both Stealth and Expanse models achieve industry-leading low distortion characteristics with THD below 0.03% (20-20kHz), with clear differences confirmed in ABX tests. The proprietary AMTS technology integrates waveguides, diffusion control, quarter-wave resonators, and Helmholtz resonators into unified acoustic control, with standing wave elimination and frequency response optimization scientifically verified. Independent measurements by Audio Science Review show the Expanse received the highest rating among open-back headphones measured for target curve compliance, demonstrating its objective performance excellence. Driver matching achieves precision within 0.25dB.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Dan Clark Audio's technology level is at industry-leading standards. The proprietary V-planar technology is an innovative, patented technique that improves bass performance and diaphragm stability through surface texturing of the driver. The 4th generation planar magnetic driver is completely in-house designed, not a combination of OEM parts. AMTS technology represents cutting-edge application of metamaterial engineering to acoustics, achieving a compact structure integrating multiple acoustic control functions. The patented TrueFlow magnet array technology for airflow improvement achieves significant enhancement in detail reproduction. Hand assembly in the USA ensures high-quality control standards, and the engineering approach based on acoustic theory sets their designs apart from competitors.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Dan Clark Audio's pricing is relatively reasonable considering the innovative technology, but lacks absolute superiority in pure performance-to-price ratio. For example, while the AEON 2 series (approximately USD 900) offers excellent performance, products with equal or superior measured performance exist such as Moondrop Venus (USD 600) and HiFiMAN Edition XS (USD 500). Based on review policy comparing to "the world's cheapest product with equivalent performance," CP = USD 500 ÷ USD 900 ≈ 0.56, falling short of the highest rating. High-end models like Stealth (USD 4,000) inevitably face comparison with lower-priced high-performance alternatives, requiring careful consideration from a cost-performance perspective. The company mission of "pricing significantly below competitors" only holds when compared to specific high-priced products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Dan Clark Audio's reliability is moderate with room for improvement. While hand assembly in the USA ensures certain quality standards, as a relatively new company founded in 2012, long-term usage track record is limited. Detailed information about warranty periods and support systems is lacking, falling short compared to established companies like Sennheiser and Neumann. The dealer network is limited, particularly in the Japanese market where availability and after-sales service present challenges. The complexity of planar magnetic technology requires high expertise for repairs, with concerns about long-term continuity of parts procurement and technical support. However, current products show few quality issues reported, maintaining reasonable reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Dan Clark Audio's design philosophy is generally rational. Based on clear goals of "objectively measurable performance improvement" and "optimizing price-to-performance ratio," all technical specifications have scientific foundations. V-planar technology, AMTS, and TrueFlow technology are all rational approaches based on established theories in acoustic and materials engineering. No unscientific "sound quality improvement" claims exist, with development based on measurement data and real-world verification. However, some products show design-first choices, slightly deviating from pure functionalism. While metamaterial technology application is advanced, careful verification is needed regarding long-term material stability and manufacturing cost impact. Overall, they adopt a rational design approach.

## Advice

Dan Clark Audio suits users who prioritize innovative technology and excellent cost-performance. The AEON 2 series excels as an entry to high-performance planar magnetic headphones, particularly recommended for music production and high-quality music listening due to superior midrange resolution and tonal balance. Stealth and Expanse suit audiophiles wanting to experience cutting-edge technology, but due to high prices, auditioning is strongly recommended. Always verify headphone amplifier driving capability before purchase. Due to low sensitivity, at least 500mW@32Ω output is required. Considering warranty and support concerns, purchase from reputable dealers is recommended. As a relatively new company, careful consideration is important for long-term use, with comparative listening across multiple manufacturers essential. While prioritizing technological innovation, consider pairing with established manufacturers if seeking peace of mind from track record.
