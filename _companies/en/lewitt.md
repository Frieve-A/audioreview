## Overview

LEWITT is an Austrian microphone manufacturer founded by Roman Perschon in 2010. Based in Vienna, it has grown into an international company with over 100 employees. Since its establishment, the company has released a wide range of condenser and dynamic microphones and established a position in the professional market. Operating with Austrian design and Chinese in-house factory manufacturing, they focus on quality control-oriented product development.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Per manufacturer specifications, LCT 440 PURE offers 7 dB-A self-noise, approx. 133 dB dynamic range, and 140 dB SPL max (0.5% THD). The nominal 20 Hz–20 kHz response is designed to be broadly flat. These figures are strong for the price class and translate to very low noise in practical use. Some models exhibit intentional high-frequency voicing. All values here reference official specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Solid engineering includes 1-inch gold-sputtered diaphragms and careful circuit topology. The LCT 1040 adds FET/tube blending, four tube-character options, and continuously variable polar patterns as differentiators. In-house manufacturing supports consistency. While not a measurement-breakthrough brand, execution quality is high.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

We compute using LCT 440 PURE as the representative model. Street price ≈ 289 USD. As a widely adopted alternative at similar use level, Rode NT1-A sells for ≈ 169 USD. The formula is `169 USD ÷ 289 USD ≈ 0.58`. NT1-A also offers 5 dB-A self-noise, which is advantageous for ultra-quiet sources.

As a supplementary check, LCT 240 PRO (≈ 88 USD) versus Audio-Technica AT2020 (≈ 104 USD) yields `104 USD ÷ 88 USD = 1.18 → 1.0 (clamped)`. Considering the lineup but weighting the main model comparison, an overall score of around 0.6 is appropriate. Prices vary with region and exchange rates.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

In-house manufacturing establishes a robust quality control system, and product consistency is highly regarded. Technical support infrastructure from European headquarters and warranty services through global distribution networks are well-organized. While not applicable to firmware-update-requiring product categories, physical durability and long-term stability exceed industry averages. Despite being a relatively new manufacturer, over 15 years of business continuity reduces concerns about ongoing after-sales support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The brand pursues measurable performance while also offering creative voicing options where appropriate (e.g., the LCT 1040’s tube characters). This balances reproducible capture with stylistic choice; any measurement advantage is use-case dependent. Investment in quality control and long-term support is rational.

## Advice

LEWITT suits users prioritizing build consistency and low noise in the mid price range. Choose LCT 440 PURE for transparency/quiet operation and LCT 240 PRO for budget-oriented needs. Compare against peers (Rode, Audio-Technica, etc.) using current street prices, included accessories, and specifications.
