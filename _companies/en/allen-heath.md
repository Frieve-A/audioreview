## Overview

Allen & Heath is a specialized mixing console manufacturer established in the UK in 1969. Currently a member of the Audiotonix Group, the company offers a product lineup specializing in live sound, broadcast, and DJ use, serving a wide range of applications from professional tours to high-end clubs. Its main product lines include the SQ series (compact digital mixers) and dLive series (large-scale live), both featuring 96kHz processing, the Avantis series (medium-scale live), and the renowned Xone series of DJ mixers, which are highly regarded as a club standard worldwide.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance of Allen & Heath products shows excellent values, reaching transparency levels in many parameters. For its flagship SQ series, the official technical specifications report a THD+N of 0.002% at unity gain and 0.003% at mid-gain, significantly surpassing the policy's transparency standard of 0.01% or less. The series' 96kHz/24bit processing achieves an ultra-low latency of less than 0.7ms, scientifically substantiating its practicality for live sound. The dLive and Avantis series maintain similar high performance, demonstrating the company's consistent commitment to developing scientifically valid products that enable transparent audio reproduction for human hearing.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The company's technical initiatives, such as the proprietary 96kHz-compatible FPGA processing engine "XCVI Core" and self-designed VCA faders that balance operability and durability, exceed industry standards. The XCVI Core FPGA engine, in particular, is the heart of the company's technology, achieving high-precision signal processing and low latency without relying on general-purpose DSPs. Modern connectivity, including Dante networking support and USB audio interface functions, is also well-integrated. However, the technological direction is primarily focused on the advanced implementation and optimization of existing technologies rather than creating innovative breakthroughs that shift the industry paradigm. While the technical execution is high, it does not reach the industry's highest level in terms of originality and pioneering spirit, hence this rating.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Allen & Heath demonstrates extremely high cost-performance within a specific feature and performance segment. For instance, the flagship SQ-5 (retailing around 5,200 USD) offers "48-channel processing at a 96kHz sampling rate" and professional-grade I/O. As of 2025, it is difficult to find a competing product that meets or exceeds these functional and measurement specifications at a lower price than the SQ-5. Comparable products, such as the more expensive Yamaha QL series or DiGiCo S series, far exceed the price point of the SQ series. Therefore, the SQ-5 is the de facto world's most affordable product within its class of features and performance, earning a rating of 1.0 based on our policy.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

With a company history spanning over 50 years and a reputation for "bulletproof reliability," Allen & Heath has established a high level of trust in the professional market. Under the stable management foundation of its parent company, the Audiotonix Group, it maintains a global support system. The official website continuously provides firmware updates, detailed technical documents, and specifications, with user support quality exceeding industry standards. The Xone series, in particular, is designed to withstand harsh use in clubs and festivals, with proven durability in long-term, continuous operation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company's approach is fundamentally scientific, aiming for transparent audio reproduction based on measurement performance. Its design philosophy, which focuses on optimizing objective indicators such as THD, SNR, and frequency response over subjective "musicality," is rational. The adoption of 96kHz processing and FPGA technology directly contributes to achieving audibly meaningful low latency and high-precision signal processing. Furthermore, by providing value that is difficult to replace with general-purpose equipment—such as physical faders, extensive dedicated I/O, and stable low-latency processing required in professional settings—the company clearly defines its rational existence as a specialized equipment manufacturer.

## Advice

Allen & Heath is a very strong option for users seeking high measurement performance and proven professional reliability. The SQ series, in particular, delivers a 96kHz native low-latency environment at a best-in-class cost-performance. If a high-precision audio environment with 96kHz processing is essential for your application, an Allen & Heath product is one of the most rational investments you can make. On the other hand, if you determine that 48kHz processing is sufficient and wish to minimize initial investment, cheaper alternatives from other brands do exist, but be aware that they fall short of the SQ series in measured performance, including latency and S/N ratio. For those considering long-term scalability, the upgrade path within the company's ecosystem from SQ to Avantis and dLive is also an attractive feature.
