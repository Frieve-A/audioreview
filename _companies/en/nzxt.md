## Overview

NZXT is primarily a PC gaming hardware manufacturer known for cases, cooling systems, and gaming peripherals. The company entered the audio market with their Relay ecosystem, consisting of desktop speakers, subwoofer, gaming headset, and the innovative SwitchMix stand/mixer. While NZXT brings gaming-focused design and ecosystem integration to audio products, their limited audio product line and focus on aesthetics over pure performance places them as a niche player in the competitive gaming audio market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The NZXT Relay system shows mixed scientific performance based on published specifications. Positives: speakers THD <1% at 1 kHz and SNR 110 dB [4], headset THD <1% at 1 kHz with Hi-Res 20 Hz–40 kHz response [6], and a defined crossover at 1,600 Hz for the speakers [4]. Limitations: speakers frequency response is 70 Hz–20 kHz which typically requires a subwoofer for full-range playback [4], and the subwoofer THD is listed at 5% at 250 Hz [5], exceeding transparent-level targets. Overall, functionality is adequate for gaming use but not exceptional in transparency.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

NZXT demonstrates solid engineering with the innovative SwitchMix automatic switching mechanism and seamless ecosystem integration. Technical highlights include glass fiber woofers, silk dome tweeters, proper crossover implementation at 1,600Hz, and DTS 7.1 surround processing. The Hi-Res Audio certified headset with 40mm neodymium drivers shows competent design. However, the technology largely employs conventional approaches without breakthrough innovations. The automatic switching technology, while clever, represents more of a convenience feature than fundamental audio advancement, placing NZXT above average but below industry-leading technology implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

We evaluate CP using current, verifiable market and MSRP data. Two representative configurations:
- 2.0 desktop speakers only: Relay Speakers 249.99 USD MSRP [8] vs Creative T60 94.99 USD (USB‑C, Bluetooth 5.0, Clear Dialog) [1]. Calculation: 94.99 USD ÷ 249.99 USD = 0.38 → 0.4.
- 2.1 ecosystem (speakers + sub): Relay 249.99 + 149.99 = 399.98 USD MSRP [8] vs Logitech Z407 129.99 USD (80 W 2.1 with sub) [2]. Calculation: 129.99 USD ÷ 399.98 USD = 0.325 → 0.3.

Because NZXT positions Relay as an ecosystem, we prioritize the 2.1 comparison and set CP = 0.3. The SwitchMix convenience does not materially change fidelity for CP purposes.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

NZXT provides a two‑year warranty for speakers and the audio mixer category [3], supported by established customer service from its broader hardware business. As a newer entrant in audio, long‑term field reliability is still limited in public data. Build quality appears acceptable, but more time in market is needed to establish comprehensive reliability patterns.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

NZXT's design philosophy prioritizes gaming ecosystem integration and aesthetic consistency over pure audio optimization. While the SwitchMix automatic switching represents rational convenience innovation, the overall approach emphasizes visual design and brand integration rather than measurement-driven audio improvement. The decision to require subwoofer integration for adequate bass response reflects compromises for form factor over acoustic optimization. Gaming-focused features like DTS processing provide practical value, but the premium pricing for primarily aesthetic and convenience features rather than superior audio measurements indicates a design philosophy that meets expected functionality without pursuing transparent-level audio performance or significant cost reduction through efficient engineering.

## Advice

NZXT Relay system suits users prioritizing aesthetic integration within NZXT gaming setups and valuing the convenience of automatic headset/speaker switching. The ecosystem approach works well for dedicated gaming environments where visual consistency and convenience features justify the premium. However, users focused on audio quality per dollar should consider alternatives like Logitech Z407 or Creative systems offering equivalent performance at significantly lower cost. The system requires full ecosystem adoption to realize its intended benefits, making it less suitable for users seeking standalone audio components or maximum performance per dollar.
