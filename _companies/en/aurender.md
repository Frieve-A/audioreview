summary: "Aurender is a Korean company developing high-end music servers based on the philosophy of 'eliminating computers from audio.' While their noise-reduction hardware design is technically commendable, the sonic superiority claims lack scientific foundation, and prices reach tens of times that of equivalent-function generic solutions. Their comprehensive remote support is appreciated, but cost-performance is extremely poor, making these products suited for users prioritizing brand prestige and ownership satisfaction over rational considerations."

## Overview

Aurender was established in 2010 as a Korean audio company. Viewing noise and complexity issues when using generic computers for audio playback as problematic, they advocate the concept of "eliminating computers from audio." Their solution combines audio-optimized hardware with their proprietary "Aurender Conductor" app in a closed ecosystem. Featuring linear power supplies, SSD playback caching, OCXO (Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillator) implementation, and other designs pursuing noise reduction and high-precision data transmission, they have established a solid position in the high-end market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Aurender's design philosophy centers on the claim that thoroughly eliminating electrical noise and jitter from generic PCs improves final DAC analog output quality. Noise-reduction approaches like linear power supplies, SSD caching, and board isolation are engineering-valid methods. However, minimal scientific evidence exists that these effects manifest as significant audible differences within human hearing range. Modern high-performance DACs possess high jitter and noise rejection capabilities, making it extremely unlikely that transport-side micro-improvements would appear as audible differences in DAC analog output. Most claims rely on users' subjective reviews, with no controlled ABX blind test validation data available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Aurender's technology level merits high evaluation as a dedicated equipment manufacturer. Rather than generic PC component assemblies, some models employ proprietary motherboard designs with physical separation and shielding of noisy components (CPU, storage, display circuits) from audio output sections, implementing thorough noise countermeasures. All models adopt linear power supplies, with upper-tier models featuring increasingly sophisticated configurations. The approach of temporarily caching playback files from internal HDD/SSD to dedicated cache SSD before playback represents rational design avoiding noise contamination during playback. Developing and maintaining their proprietary "Aurender Conductor" app demonstrates high technical capability and commitment to hardware-software optimization.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Aurender products demonstrate extremely poor cost-performance from pure functional performance perspectives. The company's products fundamentally serve as "transports" receiving digital data from storage or streaming services and outputting to DACs. This functionality is achievable with far less expensive components.

For example, comparing Aurender's entry model "N150" (approximately 3333 USD) to equivalent-function alternatives:
- **Server/Transport**: Raspberry Pi 4 (approximately 53 USD) or fanless Mini PC (approximately 267 USD)
- **DAC**: Topping E30 II (approximately 147 USD, SINAD 115dB approaching measurement limits)
- **Software**: Volumio (free version available) or Roon (paid)

Total cost for this alternative configuration: approximately 413 USD for PC-based systems.
`CP = 413 USD ÷ 3333 USD ≈ 0.12`
Raspberry Pi-based systems would yield even lower CP values. Aurender's hundreds of thousands of yen pricing represents payment for chassis quality, brand value, and scientifically questionable "noise reduction" added value, with reproduction quality cost-efficiency being extremely poor.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Aurender emphasizes support infrastructure. Their most distinctive feature is "remote support," where technicians access user equipment via internet for direct problem diagnosis and resolution. This represents highly valuable service for complex software configuration and troubleshooting. Warranty periods are standard at 2 years from purchase (requiring authorized dealer purchase, non-transferable). However, the critical "Aurender Conductor" app receives mixed reviews (mid-3 star ratings) on App Store and Google Play, with negative feedback regarding stability including "freezing" and "connection drops." While hardware reliability appears high, software stability requires improvement.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design philosophy combines rational and irrational aspects. Optimizing hardware and OS specifically for audio playback, adopting low-power CPUs, and reading only cached SSD data during playback to reduce overall system electrical noise represents rational approaches. However, whether these noise reduction efforts significantly contribute to final audio quality given modern high-performance DAC capabilities lacks objective data, suggesting potential over-engineering into irrational territory. The tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollar pricing is irrational compensation for these minute differences (or potentially nonexistent differences). While the closed ecosystem prioritizing user experience maintains consistency, it also restricts user freedom.

## Advice

When considering Aurender products, you must clarify your priorities. If you value "experiential value"—liberation from PC audio complexity, ownership of beautifully finished chassis, and stable operation with comprehensive support—Aurender presents an attractive option. Their refined user interface and remote support offer significant advantages unavailable elsewhere.

However, if your goal is purely achieving the best "sound quality" at the most rational cost, Aurender is not recommended. Equivalent or measurably superior performance systems can be built at a fraction of Aurender product prices. You should understand that Aurender's claimed "sound quality improvement through noise reduction" lacks scientific proof and largely represents psychological effects created by brand perception.
