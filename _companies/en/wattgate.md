## Overview

Wattgate markets “Audio Grade” AC plugs, IEC connectors, and wall outlets through Kimber Kable’s channels. Product literature and reseller listings highlight Perma-Lock terminals and multi-layer plating (e.g., gold/rhodium variants) across NEMA 5-15P, IEC and Schuko styles [3][6][7].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Controlled listening has not demonstrated audible advantages for premium power cords/connectors over generic cords in properly functioning systems. A formal ABX blind test comparing generic and luxury power cords found no statistically significant discrimination by listeners [1]. Engineering analyses likewise show that perceived improvements typically trace to connection quality and system setup, not exotic connector finishes [2]. There is no credible third-party measurement showing sonic change attributable to Wattgate connectors beyond ordinary safe electrical performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

“Perma-Lock” is a mechanical terminal scheme; the marketed multi-layer plating stacks are standard surface-finish practices for corrosion resistance and durability. The available materials do not indicate proprietary fidelity technology or measurable audio improvements versus industrial connectors of the same rating [3][6][7].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Representative item: Wattgate 330i Ag (NEMA 5-15P) retails for **95 USD** [3][4]. An equivalent UL/CSA-listed NEMA 5-15P plug from Leviton (515PR) costs **7.41 USD** per unit when purchased individually on Leviton’s store [5][4]. Both provide the same user-facing function and basic rating (15 A/125 V straight-blade plug).  
**CP calculation:** 7.41 USD ÷ 95 USD = **0.078** → displayed as **0.1**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

These are simple parts using conventional materials. Resellers state UL/cUL compliance for specific Wattgate models (e.g., 5266 EVO) [7], while industrial comparators (Hubbell, Leviton) provide explicit UL 498 documentation in their datasheets [8][5]. No systematic reliability issues are evident; support is via Kimber Kable’s distribution network. The premium price does not buy documented reliability beyond standard listings.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Positioning cosmetic finishes and connector plating as sonic upgrades is not supported by controlled tests or established engineering. Without evidence of audible improvement, selling "audio grade" AC hardware at large premiums is not a rational path to higher fidelity [1][2].

## Advice

Prioritize verified bottlenecks (transducers, room, DSP) over AC plug swaps. If you need a plug/IEC, pick a UL-listed industrial/commercial model (Hubbell, Leviton) sized for your cable and strain relief. Consider Wattgate only if you specifically value its appearance and branding, not for sound quality.
