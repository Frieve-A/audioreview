## Overview
OPPO Digital (Menlo Park, CA) ceased new product development in April 2018 but announced that **support, warranty, and repairs continue** via its spun-off team OT Service, Inc. Its HA-1/HA-2 DAC/amps and Sonica DAC earned praise for solid, measurement-first engineering and balanced designs [14][15].

## Scientific Validity
$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$
Third-party measurements and official documents show transparent-class performance for the era. **Sonica DAC (ES9038PRO)**: Archimago reports *very low noise/distortion* and notes XLR outperforming RCA; device supports PCM 32-bit/768 kHz and DSD512 [1][2]. **HA-2 (portable)**: Secrets’ AP benches show **THD+N 0.016% (1 kHz)** and **IMD 0.008%**; similar results at 24/192 [3]. **HA-1 (desktop)**: Official specs list **THD+N <0.00056% (A-wtd)**, **SNR >110–115 dB**, and **FR 20 Hz–20 kHz +0/-0.04–0.07 dB**; ASR provides complete measurements [4][5][6]. These meet common transparency thresholds (≈≤0.01% THD+N, ≥~110 dB SNR/DR).

## Technology Level
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$
Adopted then-flagship ESS converters (ES9038PRO/ES9018), **fully balanced** analog paths, robust linear PSUs, and on HA-1 a **discrete Class-A** headphone stage with balanced outputs. Modern and conservative rather than groundbreaking; still technically sound for transparent playback [2][4].

## Cost-Performance
$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$
Company-level CP is averaged across **representative categories** using last known new MSRP (denominator) vs the **cheapest current** equivalent-or-better option (numerator).  
- **Desktop DAC/amp (HA-1: 1,199 USD)** → **Topping DX5 II** (balanced DAC/amp; independent measurements confirm transparency; street **299 USD**) ⇒ **299 USD ÷ 1,199 USD = 0.249** [7][8][9].  
- **Network DAC/streamer (Sonica DAC: 799 USD)** → **WiiM Ultra** (balanced-class outputs via preamp stage, transparent measured performance; **329 USD**) ⇒ **329 USD ÷ 799 USD = 0.413** [10][11].  
- **Portable DAC/amp (HA-2: 299 USD)** → **FiiO BTR17** (balanced portable, modern codecs/USB DAC; **219 USD**) ⇒ **219 USD ÷ 299 USD = 0.732** [12][13].  
Simple average: **(0.249 + 0.413 + 0.732)/3 = 0.4645 → 0.5** (rounded to 0.1). Each comparator matches user-visible role/I/O and shows transparent-class performance.

## Reliability & Support
$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$
OPPO announced on **April 2, 2018** that it would stop manufacturing, while **continuing support, warranty, and repairs** with firmware updates “from time to time.” Support pages remain active in 2025 under OT Service, Inc. Discontinuation and sparse updates keep the score low but non-zero [14][15].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy
$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$
Clear, measurement-driven design (balanced topologies, robust PSU, datasheet-consistent performance) and avoidance of occult claims. Sound engineering focus with sensible feature integration [2][4].

## Advice
- **Already own OPPO gear**: Keep using it; leverage the active support channel for repairs/firmware [14][15].  
- **Shopping today for OPPO-like gear**:  
  - **Desktop DAC/amp** — **Topping DX5 II**, balanced & strong lab results (~**299 USD**) [7][8][9].  
  - **Network DAC/streamer** — **WiiM Ultra**, transparent measurements, rich I/O (~**329 USD**) [10][11].  
  - **Portable** — **FiiO BTR17**, balanced 4.4 mm/USB DAC/LDAC (~**219 USD**) [12][13].
