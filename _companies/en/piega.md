## Overview

Piega is a Swiss speaker manufacturer founded in 1986 by Kurt Scheuch and Leo Greiner. Based in Horgen on the shores of Lake Zurich, the company has been manufacturing handcrafted speakers featuring ribbon drivers and seamless aluminum cabinets for over 35 years. The company holds the #1 speaker market share in Switzerland and currently exports to over 40 countries as a family-owned business, offering the Master Line Source, Coax Gen2, Premium, and ACE series. As a pioneer of ribbon technology in the consumer market, Piega has established its industry position with unique coaxial ribbon systems.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Stereophile measurements of the Piega C8 LTD show exceptionally flat response when averaged in a 30-degree horizontal window from midrange to treble, while the Premium Wireless 701 records excellent distortion performance of 0.0015% THD at 96dB. The Coax Gen2 series has a specified frequency response of 35Hz-50kHz, showing performance close to the transparency level in measurement standards. However, some models exhibit slight mid-bass boost, and What Hi-Fi reviews note that bass shows measured boost while mid-treble becomes relatively reserved. The transparency of treble through ribbon technology is highly commendable, though complete transparency across the full spectrum has not been achieved.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Piega's technology level ranks among the industry's highest standards. The coaxial ribbon drivers C112+ and C212+ cover a wide bandwidth of 400Hz-50kHz and are technically advanced in achieving perfect phase alignment between midrange and treble. Ribbon diaphragms are 50 times lighter than conventional dome tweeters and offer superior transient response. Seamless cabinets machined from single aluminum blocks represent proprietary technology that effectively suppresses resonance. Revolutionary technologies such as the Tension Improve Module (TIM) are also implemented, representing valuable technology that other companies would desire. However, some technologies may have limited audible improvement effects.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Piega's cost-performance is at an extremely low level. For company review, comparing multiple representative products with weighted average (main Coax Gen2 611 weighted 0.6, Premium 701 Gen2 weighted 0.4). For example, the Polk Legend L100 (699 USD / pair) exists with equivalent functionality and performance to the Coax Gen2 611 (19,995 USD), resulting in the calculation 699 USD ÷ 19,995 USD = 0.035. The KEF LS50 Meta (999 USD / pair) achieves similar performance to the Premium 701 Gen2 (7,995 USD), with the calculation 999 USD ÷ 7,995 USD = 0.125. Weighted average (0.035×0.6 + 0.125×0.4) = 0.071, adjusted overall to 0.1. Regardless of driver type, products with equivalent functionality and performance are available at 3-10% of the price, and the Swiss-made premium does not provide value commensurate with the pricing.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Piega has established high reliability as an established manufacturer with over 35 years of manufacturing experience. Manufacturing processes based on Switzerland's stringent quality control standards are estimated to result in failure rates significantly below industry averages. The consistent quality control system under family ownership and export performance to 40 countries demonstrate stable business continuity. Warranty periods and after-service systems maintain industry-standard levels, and support quality as a high-end audio manufacturer meets expectations. However, innovative firmware update responses are limited compared to emerging manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Piega's design philosophy is rational and scientific. All technology investments directly contribute to measurable sound quality improvements, including pursuit of treble transparency through ribbon technology, optimization of phase alignment through coaxial arrangement, and resonance suppression through aluminum cabinets. The consistent approach toward achieving transparency levels in measurement standards is commendable. The company demonstrates high rationality by eliminating occult claims and unscientific marketing while continuing product development based purely on acoustic engineering. The treble extension to 50kHz exceeds human audible range, but this represents a logical design choice that leverages ribbon technology characteristics. However, the pricing does not fully align with performance improvements, slightly impairing rationality.

## Advice

While Piega manufactures technically excellent speakers, pricing has reached levels that do not justify sound quality improvements. Given the reality that equivalent performance can be achieved with Polk or KEF products at 3% to 10% the cost, purchase consideration should be approached carefully. Recommendations are limited to those with strong commitment to ribbon technology who also value Swiss-made rarity, or those who prioritize the aesthetics of aluminum cabinets. For practical sound quality improvement, choosing equivalent-performance other company products enables significant cost savings. When considering Piega purchases, confirming satisfaction commensurate with the price difference through measurement-based comparison is essential.
