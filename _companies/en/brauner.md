## Overview

Brauner Microphones is a German manufacturer specializing in professional-grade tube microphones, targeting serious professionals who require high-quality recording tools. Founded with a focus on creating "inimitable" equipment for demanding applications, the company has established a reputation for hand-crafted tube microphones over three decades. Production is currently paused, with plans to restart in 2025 to celebrate their 30th anniversary. Despite the production hiatus, service operations remain active with RMA support available for existing customers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Brauner's VM1 microphone demonstrates solid performance against measurement criteria for professional microphones. The VM1 achieves a signal-to-noise ratio of 81-83 dB, meeting the transparent level requirement of 80 dB or above [1]. Maximum SPL capability of 142 dB exceeds the excellent level of 140 dB. However, equivalent noise levels of 11-13 dB A fall slightly above the transparent level of below 10 dB-A, though well within professional standards and below the problematic level of 20 dB-A. The frequency response of 18 Hz - 24 kHz surpasses standard professional requirements. Conservative evaluation is applied due to mixed measurement sources showing discrepancies between official specifications and third-party measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Brauner demonstrates significant technical expertise in specialized tube microphone design and manufacturing. The company employs in-house design with hand-manufacturing processes in Germany, including hand-lathed gold-sputtered diaphragms and non-feedback class-A amplifier designs [2]. Technical sophistication includes the use of vintage Telefunken EF 806S tubes and toroidal transformer designs. However, the technology foundation relies on mature analog approaches rather than contemporary innovation. While the hand-manufacturing expertise would take considerable time for competitors to replicate, the overall technological direction remains conservative without integration of digital or software technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Cost-performance evaluation reveals significant pricing disadvantage compared to equivalent alternatives. The Neumann TLM 107 provides equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance at 1,269 USD versus the VM1's 6,499 USD. The TLM 107 offers equivalent polar pattern functionality, 10 dB-A noise (equivalent-or-better), 84 dB A-weighted S/N ratio (equivalent-or-better), and 141 dB SPL maximum (equivalent). CP = 1,269 USD ÷ 6,499 USD = 0.2.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Brauner maintains strong support commitment with a 30-year operational history and continued service availability despite production pause. RMA services remain active, demonstrating customer support dedication [3]. Some dealers offer extended 3-year warranties beyond standard manufacturer coverage. The company's three-decade track record in professional audio provides confidence in longevity and industry recognition. However, tube technology inherently requires more maintenance than solid-state alternatives due to component degradation over time. The hand-manufactured construction suggests quality but may present serviceability challenges compared to mass-produced alternatives.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Brauner's design philosophy prioritizes subjective vintage tube characteristics over scientific measurement-based improvement. Marketing emphasizes "spirit of classic vintage tube microphones" and unmeasurable qualities like "warmth" without scientific validation [4]. The approach focuses on traditional craftsmanship and hand-manufacturing processes that add significant cost without demonstrated measurement performance benefits compared to modern alternatives. While appropriate as specialized professional equipment, the philosophy emphasizes nostalgia and subjective characteristics rather than advancing technical performance through measurement-focused innovation. Cost optimization is compromised by investment in vintage technology and inefficient production processes.

## Advice

Brauner microphones target users who prioritize traditional tube characteristics and craftsmanship over cost-effectiveness. Consider these microphones if you specifically require vintage tube sound character and have budget flexibility, particularly for applications where subjective tonal qualities outweigh measurement optimization. However, for most professional recording applications, significantly more cost-effective alternatives provide equivalent or superior measured performance. The current production pause adds uncertainty for new purchases and long-term support. Users seeking optimal cost-performance for professional recording should explore modern alternatives that achieve transparent measurement levels at lower costs.
