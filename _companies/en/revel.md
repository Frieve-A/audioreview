summary: "A high-end speaker brand under Harman International that was born as a sister brand to Mark Levinson with full technical cooperation from JBL. Through their scientific measurement-based design approach, they develop products like the F228Be and F208 with textbook-excellent measurement data. Through beryllium tweeters and DCC (Deep Ceramic Composite) cone technology, they achieve both frequency response flatness and low distortion characteristics. While prices are not cheap, they have earned high evaluation through the stable support system of a large corporation and rational design philosophy."

## Overview

A high-end speaker brand under Harman International that was born as a sister brand to the world's finest audio brand "Mark Levinson." With full technical cooperation from JBL, they pursue the ideal form of next-generation speakers in anticipation of digital audio evolution. They use scientific measurement data based on ANSI/CEA-2034 standards as design criteria, achieving performance backed not only by subjective sound quality evaluation but also by objective measurement data.

Current flagship products are the Performa3 series and Performa Be series, with the F208 and F228Be in particular boasting completion levels where measurement data is praised as "textbook-like." With the announcement of the JBL Summit series in 2025, technology sharing with parent company JBL enables product development that constantly incorporates the latest acoustic technologies. The stable corporate foundation as part of the Samsung Electronics-owned Harman Group is also a characteristic feature.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Revel sets measurement data based on ANSI/CEA-2034 standards as design goals, and their effectiveness is clearly proven by measurement results. The F228Be achieves wideband characteristics of 27Hz-44kHz (-6dB) and extremely flat frequency response of ±3.1dB from 300Hz-20kHz. The F208 also extends bass to 23Hz (-10dB) while securing sensitivity of 88.9dB/2.83V/m. Beryllium tweeters have ultra-high frequency reproduction capability extending beyond 40kHz, and DCC (Deep Ceramic Composite) cone technology also provides excellent mid-low frequency distortion characteristics. All of this measurement data has been verified by independent institutions, demonstrating the effectiveness of scientifically-based acoustic design.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design that concentrates JBL/Harman's acoustic technologies is industry-leading. The combination of beryllium dome tweeters and acoustic lenses achieves both directivity control and high-frequency extension. DCC (Deep Ceramic Composite) cone technology significantly improves the lightness and rigidity of aluminum cones, achieving low distortion characteristics. The F228Be achieves both high sensitivity and wideband reproduction through design with minimum impedance of 3.42Ω and EPDR (Equivalent Peak Dissipation Resistance) of 1.6Ω. The crossover frequency settings of 260Hz and 2.1kHz are also optimized to maximize the characteristics of each driver. The combination of cast frame and bass reflex design also demonstrates high technical completion.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For products with 27Hz-44kHz characteristics equivalent to the F228Be (USD 10,000), the KEF R7 Meta (USD 4,500) can be cited. CP = USD 4,500 ÷ USD 10,000 = 0.45. For products with 23Hz-40kHz characteristics equivalent to the F208 (USD 3,100), the KEF R3 Meta (USD 1,800) exists. CP = USD 1,800 ÷ USD 3,100 = 0.58. For products with performance at the Performa3 M106 (USD 1,700) level, the KEF Q350 (USD 600) can be cited. CP = USD 600 ÷ USD 1,700 = 0.35. While beryllium tweeters and DCC technology are advanced, there is approximately a 2-3 times price difference in terms of pure measurement performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The stable corporate foundation of Harman International under Samsung Electronics establishes a long-term support system. With sales results in over 30 countries worldwide, Harman International Japan also provides comprehensive support as an official distributor within Japan. As the Harman Group, they have extensive experience in professional markets and support product reliability through technology sharing with renowned brands like JBL, AKG, and Mark Levinson. Parts supply and repair services also have the stability characteristic of large corporations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The stance of setting objective measurement data based on ANSI/CEA-2034 standards as design goals is extremely rational. Rather than relying on subjective sound quality evaluation, they achieve reproducible high sound quality through scientifically-based design approaches. The method of applying technology cultivated in JBL's professional speakers to consumer use is also a rational choice that balances practicality and performance. All design decisions have clear technical foundations: crossover design that maximizes each driver's characteristics, directivity control considering room acoustic characteristics, etc. No unscientific elements are included, and the design ensures that measurement data matches actual sound quality.

## Advice

Revel is a high-end speaker brand characterized by design based on scientific evidence that concentrates the technological capabilities of the Harman Group. The F208 as an entry-level machine and F228Be as an advanced machine each provide excellent performance backed by measurement data. They are an optimal choice particularly for those who emphasize objective measurement data and seek reproducible high sound quality. While prices are not cheap, they have advantages in measurement data completion within the same price range. The stable support system of a large corporation is also attractive and can be recommended as an investment premised on long-term use. However, if seeking pure cost-performance, comparison with lower-priced products with similar measurement data is necessary. This brand can be strongly recommended for those who empathize with scientific design philosophy and value a stable corporate foundation.
