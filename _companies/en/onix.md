summary: "An established British audio manufacturer founded in 1984. Its flagship product, the OC93, boasts excellent official specifications, including a THD of <0.002% and an S/N ratio of >112dB. However, with a high price of 1,230,000 JPY, its cost-performance is rated extremely poorly, as alternative products with comparable features and excellent measured performance are available for less than a tenth of the price."

## Overview

Founded in the UK in 1984, ONIX is an established audio manufacturer still led by its founder, Adam Worsfold. The company promotes itself as "British Made & Engineered" and has been manufacturing high-end audio equipment for over 40 years. However, the company remains small-scale with a limited product lineup, focusing primarily on the OC93 CD Player/DAC/Streamer and the OA21 series amplifiers.

The company previously faced complex legal disputes over trademark rights with Shanling (China), which were finally resolved in 2020. The current ONIX is positioned as the legitimate entity based on the trademark registered under Adam Worsfold's personal name in 1988.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The flagship product, the OC93, claims excellent official specifications, including a THD of <0.002% and a Signal-to-Noise Ratio of >112dB (A-weighted). These figures comfortably meet the "transparent" criteria of our review policy (THD <0.01%, S/N >105dB), indicating high scientific validity. This suggests a design that properly utilizes the performance of the AKM AK4497 DAC.

However, these are manufacturer-claimed specifications and have limited verification from detailed measurements by credible third-party sources. Therefore, while we acknowledge the excellent official specs, the score is set to 0.8 to reflect the lack of complete objective validation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ONIX's technology level can be assessed as above the industry average. Achieving an excellent measured performance of THD <0.002% in the flagship OC93 indicates that the company possesses solid circuit design technology that leverages high-performance off-the-shelf components, rather than simply combining them.

Adam Worsfold's over 40 years of experience likely contributes to this solid performance. On the other hand, there is little information on innovative proprietary technologies or patents; the approach is to achieve a high degree of perfection within the framework of existing technology. While not at a level that leads the industry, it is recognized as a proven technological capability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

ONIX receives an extremely harsh cost-performance evaluation. The flagship OC93 (1,230,000 JPY) integrates a CD player, DAC, and streamer. However, equivalent functionality can be achieved with a combination of more affordable components. For instance, pairing a high-performance streamer like the WiiM Pro Plus (approx. 33,000 JPY) with a CD transport like the Cambridge Audio CXC V2 (approx. 70,000 JPY) provides all the core functions of the OC93 for a total of around 103,000 JPY.

Calculation: 103,000 JPY ÷ 1,230,000 JPY ≈ 0.084

This results in a cost-performance score of 0.1. The OC93 is priced approximately 12 times higher than an alternative setup with equivalent functionality, with no clear technological advantages or added value to justify this price difference.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the 40-year corporate history deserves recognition, limitations exist in reliability and support due to the small-scale nature of the business. The company lacks a global sales network, primarily remaining within UK domestic sales, making comprehensive global support systems unlikely.

Although the past trademark dispute with Shanling was resolved, this represented a concern regarding corporate stability. Additionally, limited production quantities raise concerns about long-term parts supply and repair support continuity. While corporate continuity appears higher compared to emerging Chinese manufacturers, they cannot provide the comprehensive support systems of major manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ONIX's design philosophy is rational in its adherence to the traditional British audio approach while aiming for high measured performance. The use of a quality DAC chip to achieve an excellent specification like a THD of <0.002% demonstrates a sincere commitment to the goal of faithful sound reproduction.

However, the necessity of offering this performance at a price of 1,230,000 JPY remains questionable. In an era where products with equivalent or better functionality and comparable measured performance are available for significantly less, the rationale for insisting on a high-end, all-in-one dedicated device is weak. While the commitment to performance is commendable, the pricing, which ignores the overall market cost structure, undermines the overall rationality.

## Advice

ONIX products, while possessing excellent basic performance, are priced exceptionally high and cannot be recommended for everyone. They are best suited for users who prioritize the "British-made high-end audio" brand value or a specific design aesthetic.

- **For users balancing performance and cost**: We strongly recommend purchasing a high-performance streamer like the WiiM Pro Plus and a separate CD player or transport of your choice. You can achieve equivalent or better functionality for less than a tenth of the price.
- **For high-end oriented users**: While ONIX's official specifications are excellent, for the same price, you can likely find products from major manufacturers with more robust support systems and more extensive third-party measurement data, potentially leading to greater overall satisfaction.

While ONIX produces products with solid performance, their unrealistic pricing in the current market environment makes them an irrational choice.
