## Overview

JCALLY is an audio brand established in 2015 by Dongguan JieShi Acoustic Technology Co., Ltd. With 268 production staff and a 10,000 square meter production facility, they primarily manufacture portable DAC/amplifiers, audio adapters, and cables. Their distinguishing feature is achieving pricing at less than half of competing products while adopting high-quality DAC chips such as Cirrus Logic's CS43131 and Conexant's CX31993. Their flagship products like the JM20 and JM6 Pro offer DAC chips comparable to competitors selling for around 50 USD at just 24-25 USD, earning high praise from audio enthusiasts.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

JCALLY's flagship product lineup demonstrates excellent measurement performance approaching transparent levels. The JM20 (with CS43131) achieves an SNR exceeding 120dB and THD+N below 0.0003%, significantly surpassing the transparent level benchmarks (SNR 105dB or higher, THD 0.01% or lower). The JM6 Pro (CX31993/MAX97220) also records excellent measurements with an SNR of 124dB, THD+N of -95dB, and crosstalk of -110dB. The frequency response stays within ±1dB across the 20Hz-20kHz range, making audio degradation in the audible range scientifically negligible. These measurement results have been verified by third-party organizations, providing reliable data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

JCALLY's technical approach focuses on effectively utilizing existing high-performance DAC chips. They adopt proven industry chips like the CS43131, CX31993, and ES9280AC PRO, maximizing performance through peripheral circuit design. While they don't manufacture proprietary DAC chips, their technical capability to extract full chip performance within cost constraints is commendable. Innovations like the JM6 Pro's combination of a DAC chip (CX31993) and a separate amplifier (MAX97220), and the JM20's high output design (2Vrms@600Ω) demonstrate differentiation efforts from competitors. However, fundamental technological innovation or proprietary algorithms are not confirmed, placing their technology level at slightly above the industry standard.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

JCALLY's greatest strength lies in its cost-performance. The JM20 is priced at 24 USD, while the Moondrop Dawn Pro, which features the same CS43131 DAC chip (in a superior dual configuration), costs 50 USD. Comparing these: 50 USD ÷ 24 USD = 2.08, and since this result exceeds 1.0, the JM20 represents world-class affordability for its level of functionality and measurement performance. The JM6 Pro (25 USD) also stands out from many cheaper dongles that only feature a CX31993 chip by adding a separate MAX97220 amplifier for improved sound quality and power. It achieves a highly competitive price point even when compared to other amplifier-equipped competitors like the FiiO KA11 (around 30 USD). No compromises are observed in measurement performance or functionality, representing genuine price disruption achieved through manufacturing cost optimization.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a relatively new manufacturer established in 2015, its long-term reliability track record remains limited. Despite having 268 production staff and 10,000-square-meter manufacturing facilities, specific failure rate data such as RMA rates or MTBF are not publicly available. The warranty period is estimated at the industry standard of approximately one year, with details of the international support structure being unclear. Product reviews show few reports of initial defects, suggesting basic quality control is functioning, but the reliability track record is insufficient compared to established audio manufacturers. Their 10 years of OEM experience is a positive factor.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

JCALLY's design philosophy adopts a scientific and rational approach. The selection of DAC chips that directly contribute to measurable performance improvements, the design of peripheral circuits necessary for achieving transparent levels, and price disruption through cost optimization all contribute to the scientific advancement of audio quality. For DAC chips, they select based on measurable indicators like SNR, THD+N, and dynamic range rather than subjective audio evaluations. No occult elements or unscientific claims are observed, and their design philosophy purely aimed at improving measurement performance while maintaining cost efficiency deserves high evaluation. Their portable-focused design is also a rational decision suited to modern listening environments.

## Advice

JCALLY is a manufacturer with a clear concept of "providing high-performance DAC chips at the lowest possible price." When considering a purchase, first confirm whether your usage is primarily portable. For desktop environments, higher-output desktop DACs might be more suitable. For product selection, the JM20 (CS43131, 24 USD) is optimal for entry-level use, while the JM6 Pro (CX31993+MAX97220, 25 USD) should be considered when higher output or additional features are needed. As an upgrade from Apple's genuine adapter, a significant improvement in measurement performance can be expected. However, as a new manufacturer, don't expect long-term support, and make purchasing decisions with a cost-performance-focused, pragmatic approach. In terms of audio quality, they offer one of the most rational choices currently available in the market, providing performance comparable to 50 USD competitors at less than half the price.
