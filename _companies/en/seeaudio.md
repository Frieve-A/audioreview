## Overview

SeeAudio was established in 2018 as a branch of Hangzhou Xinyi Technologies, comprising individuals with extensive experience in IEM manufacturing. The company focuses on designing and marketing high-end custom and universal in-ear monitors available worldwide, primarily distributing through dealers like Linsoul and AEHiFi. At the time of this review, SeeAudio has developed multiple flagship products including the ultra-premium SeeApex MOBIUS i GV, which represents their most advanced technical achievement with a 14-driver hybrid configuration featuring electrostatic drivers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. While SeeAudio's flagship MOBIUS i GV features advanced specifications including 111dB ±1dB sensitivity, 11Ω ±1Ω impedance, and 20Hz-20kHz frequency range, critical measurement data is unavailable. Missing measurements include frequency response deviation from Harman target curve, harmonic distortion (THD/THD+N), signal-to-noise ratio, intermodulation distortion, sound isolation performance, crosstalk measurements, and dynamic range. When credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant performance data, the score defaults to 0.5 per framework guidelines [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

SeeAudio demonstrates exceptional technology level through proprietary innovations and cutting-edge driver implementation. The company's flagship MOBIUS i GV features a sophisticated 14-driver configuration (1DD+9BA+4EST) with four electrostatic drivers representing state-of-the-art technology. Their proprietary LFC (Low-Frequency Filter Conversion) technology specifically targets crossover distortion elimination with optimized 33.91 cubic millimeter cavity size for phase response optimization. EST driver technology adoption demonstrates technical sophistication that other manufacturers actively pursue. The advanced integration of dynamic, balanced armature, and electrostatic technologies shows high accumulation of know-how and represents technology that requires significant time for competitors to replicate [2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Current market price: 8,999 USD. This evaluation is based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Equivalent functionality comparison with Moondrop Chu II at approximately 25 USD, which lists impedance of 18Ω±15%, frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (IEC60318-4, 3dB), and non-linear distortion below 0.05%. Compared with MOBIUS i GV's published specifications (sensitivity 111dB±1dB, impedance 11Ω±1Ω, frequency range 20Hz-20kHz), the frequency range is equivalent and impedance is within a similar low-impedance class. Sensitivity is excluded due to incompatible reference units, and distortion is excluded because MOBIUS i GV has no published value [3]. CP = 25 USD ÷ 8,999 USD = 0.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

SeeAudio provides standard reliability and support infrastructure typical of premium IEM manufacturers. Products include one-year warranty coverage with three-month warranty on cables and adapters. The company maintains global dealer support network through authorized distributors including Linsoul, AEHiFi, and regional partners. Support services operate Monday-Friday 09:00-18:00 (UTC+8) with dedicated contact channels. However, the complex 14-driver configuration in flagship products presents inherent reliability considerations with multiple potential failure points. Limited company history since 2018 establishment provides insufficient long-term reliability data, though dealer-based support infrastructure ensures reasonable service accessibility [4].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

SeeAudio demonstrates highly rational design philosophy combining scientific measurement approaches with cutting-edge technology adoption. The company's philosophy "pure expression without any compromise to sound" is supported by adherence to 2020 Harman target curve and measurement-focused development. LFC technology specifically targets measurable crossover distortion rather than subjective improvements. EST driver implementation represents functional integration advancing ultra-high frequency reproduction capabilities. The "pushing boundaries through technology" approach demonstrates innovative attitude toward audio engineering. Design philosophy emphasizes specialized 14-driver IEM architecture justified for premium performance applications rather than marketing-driven complexity. Scientific foundation evident in Harman target curve optimization and frequency smoothing specifically targeting dynamic driver vibration response [5].

## Advice

SeeAudio represents a technically sophisticated manufacturer for audiophiles seeking cutting-edge multi-driver IEM technology. The company's flagship products demonstrate exceptional engineering with EST driver implementation and proprietary innovations. However, when evaluated solely on measured performance criteria, products such as the Moondrop Chu II at approximately 25 USD provide published specifications at dramatically lower prices, resulting in extremely poor cost-performance evaluation. The MOBIUS i GV targets collectors and enthusiasts prioritizing absolute technical advancement over value optimization. Users prioritizing measured performance should consider lower-priced alternatives with clearly published specifications. Warranty and support infrastructure is adequate through dealer network, though complex driver configurations require careful handling.
