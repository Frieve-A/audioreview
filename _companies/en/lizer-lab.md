## Overview

Lizer Lab is a Japanese audio-accessories maker founded in 2019 that develops eartips designed to mitigate in-head localization. Its products (JIJU, JIJUJET, JIJUMA series) integrate a metal phase plug to promote forward, out-of-head imaging, and the design is protected by Japanese Patent No. 6621166. Production and early sales are Japan-centric, with selective overseas retail. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent measurements using an OpenAudio Mercury coupler reported a ~15% improvement in musical intelligibility (C80) when using JIJUJET-2 versus standard tips, alongside consistent spectral changes: reduced bass level/depth, stronger midrange presence, and some attenuation in the ultra-highs. These effects are audible and align with the intended imaging change, but they do not address core transparency metrics (e.g., THD, S/N, IMD) for the transducer itself; thus the score reflects modest, specific improvements rather than broad fidelity gains. [2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The key differentiator is a patented phase-plug architecture integrated into silicone tips, iterated across JIJU → JIJUJET-2/-3 and JIJUMA variants. This is a genuine mechanical-acoustics idea for the eartip category, but it relies on straightforward materials and fabrication rather than advanced electronics or digital processing. The implementation shows steady refinement, yet overall sophistication is industry-average. [1][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Representative current pricing: JIJUJET-3 single-size set is generally listed at 3,780円 in Japan; outside Japan, JIJUJET-2 has been retailed at 52.20 SGD (≈ US-market proxy). We could not identify any cheaper product that demonstrably offers the same user-visible function (phase-plug eartips expressly engineered for out-of-head localization) with publicly documented measurement evidence (e.g., C80 improvement). Therefore, under our rule, no cheaper equivalent-or-better option exists and CP is set to 1.0. [3][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a small firm founded in 2019, long-term reliability data and formal warranty terms are limited. Retail notes indicate size-exchange support via inquiry for fit issues, which is positive, but distribution remains Japan-centric with patchy overseas channels—creating potential support and logistics friction for international buyers. [6][7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Targeting in-head localization is a rational psychoacoustic goal, and the phase-plug approach has a plausible mechanism (direct/reflected energy shaping) with third-party measurements indicating benefits. However, the gains mainly affect imaging/spectral balance rather than fundamental transparency metrics, so the approach is sensible but scope-limited. [1][2]

## Advice

Lizer Lab’s tips are best for experienced users who specifically want a more speaker-like presentation and are comfortable with side effects such as lighter bass and brighter mids. Pair them with IEMs that have robust low-frequency output and good detail retrieval. If you prioritize maximum bass or require easy global availability and formalized support, mainstream tips may remain the pragmatic choice. For those chasing imaging changes supported by measurements, these are worth shortlisting. [2]
