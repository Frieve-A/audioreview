## Overview

Established in 1977 in Nagano, Japan, Mogami Wire & Cable Corporation specializes in professional audio, video, and digital cables for studios, broadcast, and live sound. Core technologies include Neglex OFC conductors, low-capacitance balanced designs (e.g., W2549), and star-quad geometries (e.g., 2534). Manufacturing is kept in Japan. [2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Mogami publishes complete electrical specs for W2549: capacitance 76 pF/m (K₀, 1 kHz, 20 °C), inductance 0.8 µH/m (1 kHz), electrostatic noise 50 mV max, electromagnetic noise 0.15 mV max, insulation resistance 105 MΩ·m min at DC 125 V. These values imply transparency with typical studio impedances. For a 25 ft (≈7.6 m) run the total C ≈ 0.58 nF; with a 100 Ω output the RC −3 dB point is ~2.7 MHz—orders above 20 kHz—so frequency response and phase deviation across the audio band are negligible. [1]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Mogami’s engineering and disclosure are strong (comprehensive specs, consistent Japanese manufacturing, star-quad options), but the underlying cable technologies are mature and widely implemented across pro-audio peers. There is limited evidence of unique, industry-leading innovation beyond high-quality execution, so we score above average but not world-leading.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Representative finished cable price (review target basis): Mogami Gold Studio Microphone Cable 25 ft at **109.95 USD**. Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better user outcome): Monoprice Premier Series 25 ft XLR male-female at **19.99 USD**. Both are balanced XLR microphone/interconnect cables; at 25 ft with typical source/load impedances balanced cabling is transparently flat, so user-facing function and audibility are equivalent. **19.99 USD ÷ 109.95 USD = 0.18**, rounded to **0.2**. [4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Mogami’s factory-terminated assemblies carry a “No Excuses” lifetime warranty for the original purchaser via dealers or direct support—stronger than average for cables. Build quality and mechanical robustness are well-documented across its catalog. (Bulk cable warranty differs by reseller and is not the basis for this score.) [7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The company emphasizes measurable parameters (capacitance, inductance, shielding, impedance) and avoids mystical claims; recommendations like star-quad in high-RFI environments are grounded in known physics. However, since audibly equivalent results are achievable with much cheaper cables, the pricing is not “price-destructive,” so the design/market stance earns a solid but not top score. [1][6]

## Advice

For cost-sensitive users who simply need transparent XLR interconnects, Monoprice’s Premier Series (and similar) achieve equivalent audible outcomes at a fraction of the price. Choose Mogami where mechanical durability, Japanese manufacturing, consistent tolerances, or star-quad noise rejection in hostile RF environments are valued. For maximum value, buying Mogami bulk cable (e.g., W2549) and terminating with quality connectors can reduce cost while keeping its electrical advantages. [1][5]
