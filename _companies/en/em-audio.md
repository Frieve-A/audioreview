## Overview

EM Audio (Eternal Melody) was a Shanghai-based in-ear monitor manufacturer founded in 2016 by an acoustic engineer and mechanical engineer with over 8 years of prior industry experience [1]. The company specialized in hand-crafted multi-balanced armature in-ear monitors offered in both universal (UIEM) and custom-molded (CIEM) configurations across three main product tiers. Their approach emphasized customization options, artisanal production methods, and midrange-focused tuning philosophy across their entire range. The company offered the EM-2 (289-379 USD), EM-3, and EM-5 (599-749 USD) models with 2, 3, and 5 balanced armature drivers respectively [1]. However, current evidence confirms the company has become inactive, with community forums documenting that "Eternal Melody/EM Audio doesn't seem to exist anymore; their website does not load and their Taobao store seems to be inactive as well" [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

EM Audio's scientific validity across their entire product portfolio cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient objective measurement data. The company's approach to performance documentation was inconsistent across their three-model range, with only basic specifications available for the EM-2 (21Ω impedance, 113dB sensitivity, -26dB isolation) while the EM-5 has some specifications (sensitivity, resistance, frequency range, etc.) available, though EM-3 and EM-5 models lack third-party measurement data such as frequency response curves and distortion rates [1]. No frequency response measurements, THD values, or S/N ratio data exist for any model in their lineup, preventing assessment against audibility thresholds. The company's tuning philosophy emphasized midrange prominence across their range, but without quantitative verification, these claims remain subjective. Their hand-crafted production philosophy prioritized customization over scientific measurement and validation. This fundamental lack of measurable performance data across their entire product development approach makes scientific validity assessment impossible, requiring provisional scoring until comprehensive measurements become available.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

EM Audio demonstrated competent in-house design capabilities across their product range with experienced engineering leadership and accumulated acoustic expertise spanning their three-model lineup. The company implemented standard balanced armature technology with passive crossover designs throughout their range (2-way for EM-2, 3-way for EM-5) and offered both universal and custom-fit options across all models [1]. However, their technological approach remained conventional across the entire portfolio, utilizing established balanced armature driver technology without significant innovation or integration of modern digital signal processing, software, or advanced manufacturing techniques. While the engineering foundation was solid and customization options were extensive, the technology level reflects industry-standard rather than cutting-edge implementations that would distinguish their products in the competitive IEM market.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

EM Audio's cost-performance for their representative product EM-2 (current market price 289 USD) is evaluated by comparison with the world's cheapest product offering equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance. The Shure SE215 Pro (approximately 109 USD) was identified as the cheapest product providing equivalent-or-better functionality (detachable cable, in-ear monitor design) and measured performance compared to EM-2's specifications (21Ω impedance, 113dB sensitivity, -26dB isolation) [2]. The Shure SE215 Pro is equipped with detachable MMCX cable, 37dB isolation (superior to EM-2's -26dB), frequency range 20Hz-20kHz, impedance 17Ω, and sensitivity 107dB SPL/mW measured performance, providing equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance at significantly lower cost. CP = 109 USD ÷ 289 USD = 0.377. Rounded to the first decimal place, the score is 0.4. Since products with equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance are available at significantly lower prices, EM Audio's cost-performance is evaluated as extremely poor.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

EM Audio's reliability and support capabilities are severely compromised by the company's confirmed discontinuation [1]. This eliminates manufacturer warranty coverage, parts availability, and repair services for existing products. While the balanced armature construction itself is inherently robust with few moving parts, the lack of ongoing manufacturer support significantly impacts long-term ownership viability. The company's brief operational period (approximately 2016-2018) before discontinuation also limits confidence in long-term product support and parts availability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

EM Audio's design philosophy across their entire product portfolio emphasized traditional hand-crafting methods and extensive customization options, founded by engineers with relevant acoustic experience [1]. However, this company-wide approach prioritized artisanal production methods over cost-effective manufacturing optimization or advanced technology integration throughout their range. The consistent focus on hand-crafting across all models (EM-2, EM-3, EM-5) increased production costs without demonstrable performance benefits compared to modern manufacturing techniques. The company systematically avoided embracing digital signal processing, software integration, or other contemporary technologies that could improve performance per dollar across their lineup. While the engineering credentials were appropriate and customization capabilities were extensive, the conservative approach throughout their product development limited innovation and cost efficiency in an increasingly competitive market requiring both performance and value optimization.

## Advice

EM Audio products across their entire range are not recommended for current purchase consideration due to the company's discontinued status and lack of ongoing support. The company's premium pricing philosophy throughout their EM-2, EM-3, and EM-5 lineup, combined with discontinued status, makes their products unsuitable for new purchases. Prospective IEM buyers should consider active manufacturers offering equivalent balanced armature configurations with ongoing support and superior cost-effectiveness across comparable driver counts. For existing EM Audio owners across any model in their range, third-party repair services may be the only option for maintenance, though parts availability will likely become increasingly limited. The company's emphasis on hand-crafted production methods, while creating unique products, resulted in limited scalability and ultimately unsustainable business model that serves as a cautionary example of prioritizing artisanal approaches over market viability.
