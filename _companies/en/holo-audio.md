summary: "A Chinese manufacturer specializing in R2R ladder DACs. While possessing excellent measurement performance, its cost-performance is remarkably low due to the existence of more affordable and higher-performing Delta-Sigma DACs, raising questions about the rationality of its technological choices."

## Overview

Holo Audio is an audio manufacturer based in China, specializing in product development focused on R2R ladder DAC technology. Its flagship product, the May DAC, achieved high acclaim at the time of its release for features like resolution exceeding 22 bits. The current product lineup ranges from the entry-level Cyan 2 (approx. 1,200 USD) to the flagship May KTE (approx. 5,600 USD). The company's key feature is its proprietary technology that corrects resistor tolerance errors, a known challenge in R2R technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance of the company's products is excellent. The May DAC achieves channel separation exceeding 122dB and high resolution, while the Cyan 2 also records good figures for an R2R DAC, such as a THD+N of 0.0005% (PCM) and an SNR of 127dB. These measurement results meet the "transparent level" in our policy's criteria for many parameters, confirming their scientific validity for audio quality in the audible range. However, as of 2025, more affordable modern Delta-Sigma (ΔΣ) DACs achieve superior performance, meaning Holo Audio's products are not at the absolute top tier.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Holo Audio's technical level is at a respectable industry standard. The dual-network design, which configures independent ladders for PCM and DSD, and the digital compensation for resistor errors are unique approaches that contribute to the performance of the R2R method. However, R2R technology itself is an extension of existing technology and not an innovation that surpasses the latest Delta-Sigma methods in terms of measured performance. While efforts to pursue performance within the chosen technology are visible, its technical superiority is limited given the existence of better alternatives.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The cost-performance of the company's products must be rated as remarkably low. Disregarding the internal R2R architecture and comparing purely on performance, numerous more affordable and higher-performing products exist. For instance, compared to the flagship May KTE (approx. 5,600 USD), Topping's D90 III Sabre (approx. 900 USD) delivers superior measured performance, including a better SINAD value, at less than one-eighth of the price. Therefore, the cost-performance is `900 USD ÷ 5,600 USD ≈ 0.16`, resulting in a score of 0.2. This comparison is valid as differences in internal technology do not provide a scientific advantage in the final sound quality for the user.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company provides a solid support system, including a 3-year parts and labor warranty and covering one-way shipping costs for warranty items. Authorized dealers in the United States and Europe establish a proper sales and support network. Regular firmware updates are also consistently provided. For an emerging manufacturer, this is a comprehensive system, offering a relatively high level of confidence for long-term use. However, as the company is relatively young, its long-term corporate stability remains to be seen.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The company's design philosophy lacks rationality. This is due to its insistence on using the R2R method, which is prone to inferior measured performance and higher costs. While the commitment to disclosing measurement data and improving performance is commendable, it is merely optimization within an irrational technological framework. Given the existence of a clear alternative in Delta-Sigma technology, which achieves superior performance at a lower cost, Holo Audio's product development appears to prioritize adherence to a specific technology and cater to unscientific audio myths like "R2R sounds better" over scientific rationality. This approach is judged to be irrational.

## Advice

Holo Audio's products are niche items for users with a strong interest in or attachment to the specific R2R technology, even though they are backed by excellent measurement data. If your priority is purely cost and performance, these products are not recommended. There are many modern Delta-Sigma DACs, typified by the Topping D90 III Sabre, that are more affordable and offer superior measured performance. A purchase should be considered only with the understanding that a significant portion of the price of a Holo Audio product is the cost to implement the specific R2R technology.
