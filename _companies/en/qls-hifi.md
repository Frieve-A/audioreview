## Overview

QLS Hi-Fi, now operating under the QULOOS brand, is a Chinese audio manufacturer based in Shenzhen, Guangdong. Founded by Shen Zhen QLS Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., it focuses on desktop and portable digital audio players, DACs, and headphone amplifiers. Representative models include the QA360/QA361 portable players, the QA390 desktop “movable” player/DAC/amp, and the MUB1 portable DAC/amp. [1]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Across recent models, QULOOS targets transparent-level performance. The MUB1 is specified at up to 132 dB SNR and 0.0001 % THD+N (manufacturer), using four CS43131 DACs with four BUF634 output buffers and delivering up to about 1.1 W into 32 Ω balanced. [2][3][4] The QA390 uses dual AK4497 DACs; its balanced headphone stage is specified to exceed 20 V output with rated power figures up to 1.3 W/32 Ω balanced. [6][7] The older QA361 employs AK4495SEQ and supports up to 768 kHz PCM and DSD64/128 per reviewer documentation. [10] Independent lab measurements remain limited, so the above are primarily manufacturer and trusted-reviewer specs; still, taken as a whole, the line sits within audibly transparent territory.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Designs are competent and pragmatic: multi-DAC arrays (e.g., quad CS43131), robust analog stages (BUF634), disciplined clocks, and (on QA390) very large supercapacitor banks for local, low-impedance power. [2][6][7] While engineering choices are sound, they’re evolutionary rather than groundbreaking, with few proprietary innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

**Method (company review):** We use two current, representative products and average their CP scores (simple average) with comparators selected strictly for equal-or-better user-visible functions and performance.

- **MUB1 (review target price: 499.99 USD)** — Cheapest equal-or-better: **FiiO Q15 (399.99 USD)**. It’s a portable DAC/amp with balanced I/O and transparent-class specs; its balanced output power reaches up to ~1.6 W, exceeding MUB1’s ~1.1 W, with comparable or better functionality (USB, BT, gain, etc.). **CP = 399.99 ÷ 499.99 = 0.8.** [4][5]

- **QA390 (review target price: 1,399.99 USD)** — Cheapest equal-or-better: **TOPPING DX9 (1,299 USD)**. Desktop all-in-one DAC/amp with transparent-class performance and higher available output power (up to ~7 W @ 32 Ω balanced in reviews). **CP = 1,299 ÷ 1,399.99 = 0.9.** [6][8][9]

**Company CP score:** average of (0.8 and 0.9) = 0.85 → rounds to **0.9**.

> Note: A previously common comparison to dongles like iBasso DC07 Pro shows similar transparency but clearly inferior output power, so such models are not valid “equal-or-better” comparators for MUB1. [11][12]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Global support is primarily dealer-based; documented warranty terms vary by seller/region and are typically around industry average. Long-term firmware cadence and repair logistics outside China are not clearly documented. In the absence of broad field-failure data, we assign a conservative, slightly-below-average score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The development stance favors measurable transparency via competent DAC/amp topologies and power integrity (e.g., supercaps on QA390). Marketing avoids mystical claims. That said, there is relatively little emphasis on software/platform integration or cost-saving innovation that could materially improve usability or value.

## Advice

If you need portable power beyond dongles with both wired and BT input, MUB1 is a solid, transparent option—just cross-shop Q15 given its higher output at a lower price. For a transportable/desktop all-in-one, the QA390 is capable, but the DX9 undercuts it on price while matching core functions and output; consider which features (e.g., SD playback) you truly need. Evaluate based on required power, I/O, and ecosystem fit.
