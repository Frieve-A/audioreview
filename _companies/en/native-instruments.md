## Overview

Native Instruments is a German manufacturer founded in 1999 in Berlin, specializing in software and hardware for computer-based audio production and DJing. The company operates globally with offices in Los Angeles, Tokyo, London, Paris, and Shenzhen. Following the 2023 acquisition of iZotope, Brainworx, and Plugin Alliance, Native Instruments has expanded their portfolio significantly. Their current hardware offerings focus on NKS-integrated MIDI keyboards, audio interfaces (Komplete Audio 1, 2, and 6 MkII), Maschine production systems, and Traktor DJ controllers. This review evaluates their current audio interface lineup, with the Komplete Audio 6 MkII being discontinued by major retailers as of 2025.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The current Native Instruments audio interface lineup shows mixed performance levels based on available measurements. The Komplete Audio 1 achieves 109-110 dB dynamic range with equivalent input noise of -129.5 to -130 dB according to ProdJunkies review [1], reaching near-transparent performance levels for a budget interface. The Audio 2 maintains similar 24-bit/192 kHz resolution capability with high-quality preamp performance noted in third-party reviews [2]. The Komplete Audio 6 MkII demonstrates varying measurement results: American Songwriter reports 94 dB dynamic range [4], while official specifications claim 102 dB dynamic range. THD+N values of 0.006% (mic/line inputs) to 0.014% (line outputs) place performance between problematic and transparent levels. Frequency response extends from 9 Hz to 45 kHz (-1 dB at 96 kHz), meeting standard requirements. However, evaluation relies primarily on manufacturer specifications and limited third-party measurements rather than comprehensive independent data, requiring conservative scoring adjustment per policy guidelines.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Native Instruments employs standard industry components including Cirrus Logic converters without significant proprietary technology development. The Komplete Audio series represents competent engineering using established components but lacks innovation beyond standard audio interface design. DC-coupled outputs for modular synthesizer compatibility demonstrate some technical consideration, though 192 kHz support represents contemporary rather than cutting-edge capability. The company heavily relies on OEM/ODM elements without substantial proprietary patent technology adoption. Technical implementation shows appropriate combination of digital and circuit elements but lacks advanced integration of computer, cloud, or AI technologies that distinguish modern competitors.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Native Instruments demonstrates moderate cost-performance in their current available lineup. The Komplete Audio 1 currently retails for 154 USD and offers 24-bit/192 kHz capability with 109-110 dB dynamic range. The cheapest competitor with equivalent 24-bit/192 kHz capability and similar functionality is the Behringer UMC202HD at 107.42 USD, which provides identical 24-bit/192kHz functionality, XLR/TRS combo inputs, phantom power, USB bus power, and direct monitoring [2]. A more expensive alternative is the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 4th Gen at 135 USD, which provides equivalent dual-input functions and comparable measured performance [3]. Since the UMC202HD represents the world's cheapest option in this category, the Komplete Audio 1 achieves a cost-performance score of 0.7. The Komplete Audio 2 has been discontinued from major retailers, with used market pricing ranging from 34-68 USD, making direct cost-performance evaluation inappropriate.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Native Instruments provides global support infrastructure through official channels but faces mixed customer satisfaction results. Investigation reveals customer service ratings showing poor performance with some user dissatisfaction [5]. Email response delays can extend to weeks according to user reports, creating user friction. The company typically replaces defective units rather than repairing them, with replacement fees reported around 180 USD in some cases. RMA approval processes typically take 1-2 weeks. However, the company maintains official global support systems, standard warranty periods, and has established repair/replacement policies. While customer experience challenges exist, the mixed nature of feedback and presence of functional support infrastructure warrant a balanced evaluation rather than the harshest scoring.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Native Instruments demonstrates mixed design philosophy characterized by conservative technology adoption and ecosystem-focused development. The company's approach prioritizes software integration over pure hardware innovation, resulting in audio interfaces that provide reasonable performance while emphasizing compatibility with their software ecosystem. The discontinuation of the Audio 6 MkII while maintaining the Audio 1 and 2 suggests strategic focus on core market segments rather than comprehensive product development. Marketing emphasis on "sound-first" design philosophy shows moderate substantiation through competitive measured performance in their price segments. The conservative approach to technology adoption results in stable, proven designs using established components, though this limits cutting-edge performance advantages. Cost allocation balances hardware performance with software bundling, creating reasonable value for ecosystem users while potentially limiting appeal to pure hardware-focused purchasers.

## Advice

Native Instruments audio interfaces offer strong value for users prioritizing software integration with the Native Instruments ecosystem. The Komplete Audio 1 provides excellent functionality at 100 USD, representing the most cost-effective option compared to the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 4th Gen at 135 USD, making it an outstanding choice for dual-input recording needs. Users prioritizing maximum audio quality per dollar will find the Audio 1 to be the optimal selection in its functionality class. The Audio 2 and Audio 6 MkII have been discontinued from major retailers, so new purchasers should focus on the Audio 1 or consider Focusrite alternatives. These interfaces serve best as primary options for users requiring both cost-effectiveness and Native Instruments software integration, while also delivering competitive technical performance against specialized competitors like Focusrite or PreSonus.
