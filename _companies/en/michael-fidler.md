summary: "Classic Audio Ltd (Kent, UK) builds measurement-first phono stages. Linearity and distortion are excellent, but SNR (MM/MC) sits in a clearly problematic range for electronics, so scientific validity is limited despite strong features and engineering."

## Overview

Classic Audio Ltd by Michael Fidler designs and hand-assembles phono stages with objective performance as the core aim. The current lineup centers on **MM PRO** (MM/HOMC, balanced line out) and **SPARTAN 20/15** (MM/MC and MM). The **MC PRO** is **discontinued (2025-06-30)** [2]. Official direct prices: **MM PRO 900 USD**, **SPARTAN 20 670 USD**, **SPARTAN 15 490 USD** [5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Measured/official specs show **tight RIAA (±0.1 dB)** and **very low THD** across models, but **noise is clearly short of modern transparent line-level electronics**.  
- **MM PRO**: RIAA ±0.1 dB (40 Hz–22 kHz), THD <0.0005%; **SNR 79 dB (MM, ref 5 mV, 220 Hz–22 kHz)** [3].  
- **SPARTAN 20**: RIAA ±0.1 dB, THD <0.0006% (MM); **SNR 78 dB (MM, ref 5 mV) / 77 dB (MC, ref 500 µV)** [4].  

While FR/THD are exemplary, the **SNR values are at a problematic level for electronics**, constraining absolute fidelity versus state-of-the-art line stages [3][4].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Original in-house analog designs (active loading on MM PRO; discrete **class-A MC head amp** on SPARTAN 20; precision RIAA networks; LF crossfeed; linear PSU; balanced XLR on MM PRO) demonstrate solid engineering sophistication, albeit largely **analog-only** without digital/DSP integration [3][4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Target prices (USD):** MM PRO **900**, SPARTAN 20 **670**, SPARTAN 15 **490** [5].  
We searched for the **cheapest equivalent-or-better** products (equal/greater user-visible functions and **measured** performance).  
- **MM PRO:** Balanced line out + RIAA **±0.1 dB** + sub-0.001%-class THD. Pro-Ject **Phono Box DS3 B** (balanced, **799 USD**) undercuts the price but is **not equivalent** on published performance (RIAA <±0.25 dB; THD <0.001% typical; different noise spec format) [6]. **No cheaper equal-or-better** unit found ⇒ **CP = 1.0**.  
- **SPARTAN 20 / 15:** No cheaper units found that **match ±0.1 dB RIAA and ≤0.001%-class THD** with comparable overload margins at their feature sets [4][5]. **CP = 1.0**.  

For company-level CP (representative current models), the result remains **1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Direct sales with a **conditional 2-year warranty** and manufacturer repair service are documented [5]. Through-hole construction and standard parts aid serviceability [3][4]. Small-scale operation and limited global infrastructure keep this **around average**, with a modest bump for build/serviceability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The development stance is **measurement-first** (objective FR/THD targets, practical LF tools) and avoids occult claims. Despite clear strengths, **noise performance remains the gating factor** versus transparent line-level electronics; overall direction is rational but not maximally realized in absolute fidelity [3][4].

## Advice

- Prefer **MM PRO** if you need **balanced line output** from an MM/HOMC chain and care about precise RIAA/low distortion [3][5].  
- Choose **SPARTAN 20** when you need **both MM and MC** with strong linearity and useful LF tools [4].  
- **MC PRO** remains a high-performing option on the used market, but it is **discontinued** [2].
