summary: "A venerable Japanese audio manufacturer founded in 1910. Commands the world's largest share in the AV receiver market, providing excellent measured performance and rich functionality at reasonable prices. Despite ownership changes—acquired by Masimo in 2022 and sold to Harman (Samsung subsidiary) in 2025—product quality and innovation remain intact. Particularly noteworthy is their achievement of excellent THD rates of 0.05-0.08% even in entry-level models."

## Overview

Denon is a venerable Japanese audio manufacturer founded in 1910, with its official name derived from "DENki ONkyo" (Electric Sound). The company has undergone several ownership changes: merging with Marantz in 2002 to form D&M Holdings, acquired by Sound United in 2017, then by Masimo Corporation in 2022, and finally by Harman International (Samsung subsidiary) in 2025.

Currently holding the world's largest share in the AV receiver market, Denon offers a comprehensive lineup from entry-level to high-end models. The AVR-X series, in particular, has garnered tremendous support from home theater enthusiasts due to its excellent measured performance, rich functionality, and reasonable pricing. The company continues innovative technology development, including the HEOS wireless multi-room audio system.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Denon products demonstrate superior performance through objective measurement data. For example, the AVR-X5200W records an excellent SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of 95dB (with AES17 filter). In THD+N (Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise), the flagship AVR-X8500H achieves industry-leading measurement results of -103dB (0.0007%). These figures are well below the audible threshold, scientifically proving the ability to faithfully reproduce sound sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company maintains technology capabilities near industry-leading standards. Particularly highly regarded in digital signal processing technology, multi-channel amplifier design, and room correction technology (Audyssey). All models achieve THD below 0.1%, with even the entry-level AVR-S570BT realizing an excellent distortion rate of 0.08%. Early adoption of the latest video and audio formats including 8K/60Hz, 4K/120Hz compatibility, HDMI 2.1, Dolby Atmos, and DTS:X support. The proprietary HEOS wireless multi-room system is also one of the industry-leading technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The AVR-X2800H (retail price USD 665) has equivalent THD 0.06% and 95W output, but competing products with similar performance exist for around USD 400, resulting in CP = USD 400 ÷ USD 665 = 0.6. The entry-level AVR-S570BT (retail price USD 265) also faces competition from products offering equivalent performance (70W, THD 0.08%) available for USD 165, yielding CP = USD 165 ÷ USD 265 = 0.63. However, Denon provides value beyond pure measurement specifications, including feature richness, ease of setup, and long-term support, making the actual value higher than these calculations suggest.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Denon boasts high reliability backed by years of proven performance. The durability of their AV receivers is particularly well-regarded in the industry, with examples of 10+ year usage being common. As part of the Sound United group (now under Harman), they maintain a global support structure. Firmware updates are frequently provided, with continuous addition of new features and bug fixes. Domestic support in Japan through authorized dealers is also comprehensive, with prompt repair services.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Denon's design philosophy of "high performance at reasonable prices" is extremely rational. By ensuring necessary and sufficient performance while avoiding excessive premium positioning, they provide high-quality audio experiences to a broad user base. Their product development stance, which emphasizes measured performance and avoids being misled by subjective sound quality arguments, is commendable. However, some high-end models focus on performance improvements in areas where practical differences may be difficult to perceive, indicating aspects that are not entirely rational.

## Advice

Denon is an optimal choice for those considering home theater system construction. Mid-range models like the AVR-X2800H and AVR-X3800H offer excellent balance of performance and features, serving as suitable choices for most users. You can obtain 8K compatibility, latest audio format support, and excellent measured performance at relatively affordable prices.

However, for pure 2-channel audio or pursuing ultimate sound quality, specialized manufacturer products should also be considered. The uncertainty regarding future support structure due to frequent corporate acquisitions is also a factor to consider. When purchasing, clarify necessary functions and avoid excessive high-end models. Entry-level models possess sufficient performance, so appropriate model selection based on budget is crucial.
