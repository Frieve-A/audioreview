## Overview

AudioVero e.K. is a German audio software specialist founded in 2007 and based in Bielefeld. The company focuses on development, production, and distribution of software and hardware in the field of electroacoustics and audiovisual consumer electronics. Their flagship product Acourate is recognized as industry-leading digital room and loudspeaker correction software, earning high praise from professionals including mastering engineers Bob Katz and Dominique Bassal. Founded by Dr. Uli Brüggemann, an expert in electroacoustics with extensive experience, the company maintains a consistent commitment to pursuing true sound reproduction. The company started with a passion for accurate sound reproduction, driven by recognition of the importance of the complete playback system.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Acourate's scientific validity is clearly demonstrated through measurement data. The software employs 64-bit precision FIR filters capable of simultaneous correction of both frequency and phase characteristics. A 64k-tap filter achieves 0.6729Hz frequency resolution at 44.1kHz sample rate, enabling extremely precise processing for low-frequency standing wave correction. According to Bob Katz's testimonial, "the transparency is equal or superior to the uncorrected loudspeaker, stereo imaging and soundstage are more exact with effectively widened center sweet spot." The Inter-Channel Phase Alignment (ICPA) feature corrects asymmetrical group delays between channels, all based on measurable physical phenomena with solid scientific foundation. The software's ability to generate linear-phase FIR filters addresses time-domain accuracy that IIR-based competitors cannot achieve.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AudioVero e.K.'s technology level is industry-leading. Acourate goes beyond simple room correction to function as a comprehensive audio processing system integrating speaker driver correction filters and crossover network generation. The implementation meets all professional requirements including 64-bit precision processing, proper dithering at the final stage, and low-latency processing via ASIO drivers. The achievement of linear-phase characteristics through FIR filters demonstrates technical superiority impossible with IIR filter-based competitors. However, from the perspective of current digital signal processing technology, these techniques are well-established rather than innovative. The interface complexity and high learning curve reflect usability design challenges rather than technical completeness.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Acourate's current price of EUR 416 is expensive compared to competing products offering equivalent functionality. For instance, Juice Hifi's Audiolense, which also features high-precision FIR filter correction, is available from EUR 165 for the stereo version. Calculating the cost-performance based on the review policy gives `CP = 165 ÷ 416 ≒ 0.4`, suggesting that a product with comparable performance exists at about 40% of the price. Furthermore, by combining the free and highly functional REW (Room EQ Wizard) and RePhase, similar FIR filter generation is possible, although it requires specialized knowledge. Even considering its advanced functionality and the developer's dedicated support, Acourate's price cannot be considered cost-effective for the general user.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AudioVero e.K.'s reliability and support structure are good. The company has demonstrated stability through 17 years of continuous product development and customer support since its 2007 founding. In the Acourate User Group, developer Dr. Uli Brüggemann personally participates in technical support, directly answering user questions. The company maintains clear policies with paid upgrade paths for major updates while providing minor updates free of charge. However, software installation requires PC ID numbers, indicating overly strict license management. Documentation quality has been criticized by multiple user reviews as "difficult to understand," suggesting room for improvement in beginner-friendly support. Given the small company size, there are inherent risks regarding future business continuity.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

AudioVero e.K.'s design philosophy is extremely rational. From its founding, the company has maintained a clear goal of "true sound reproduction" and consistently adopted scientific approaches based on measurable physical phenomena. In Acourate's design, the emphasis on both frequency and phase correction is based on acoustically sound theory. The adoption of FIR filters to achieve linear-phase characteristics and eliminate phase distortion unavoidable with IIR filters represents technically rational choices. The software-based solution strategy achieves higher functionality at lower cost than dedicated hardware. The product development approach that completely eliminates unscientific "sound quality improvement" claims and focuses on measurement data and professional practicality is particularly commendable in an industry rife with audio mysticism. Building user communities through internet utilization also represents a modern and rational approach.

## Advice

AudioVero e.K.'s Acourate is recommended for professionals seeking reliable, high-quality room correction software and technically knowledgeable audio enthusiasts. Particularly for mastering studios and recording engineers where time efficiency and result reliability are crucial, the software provides value commensurate with its price. However, for general users, we recommend first considering lower-priced competitors like Audiolense (EUR 165-390). Basic room correction needs may be adequately met by these alternatives. If considering purchase, we strongly recommend joining the Acourate User Group beforehand to understand the learning curve and time investment required. While technical support is excellent, it's primarily conducted in German and English, so language barriers should be considered.
