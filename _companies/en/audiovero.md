## Overview

Founded in 2007, AudioVero e.K. is a German audio software company based in Bielefeld, specializing in the development, manufacturing, and sale of software and hardware in the fields of electroacoustics and audio-visual consumer electronics. Its flagship product, Acourate, is recognized as an industry-leading digital room and speaker correction software, highly praised by professionals like mastering engineers Bob Katz and Dominique Bassal. The founder, Dr. Uli Brueggemann, is an expert in electroacoustics with extensive experience, developing products with a commitment to pursuing true acoustic reproduction.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Acourate's scientific validity is clearly demonstrated by measurement data. The software uses FIR filters with 64-bit processing to simultaneously correct both frequency and phase characteristics. A 64k-tap filter at a 44.1kHz sample rate achieves a frequency resolution of 0.6729Hz, enabling extremely high-precision correction of low-frequency standing waves. According to Bob Katz, it offers 'transparency equivalent to or better than uncorrected speakers, with a more accurate stereo image and soundstage, and an effectively widened central sweet spot,' confirming audible improvements. The Inter-Channel Phase Alignment (ICPA) feature can also correct group delay asymmetries between left and right channels, all of which are scientifically-grounded technologies based on measurable physical phenomena.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AudioVero e.K.'s technological level is top-class in the industry. Acourate is designed as a comprehensive audio processing system that goes beyond simple room correction, integrating features for generating correction filters for speaker drivers and crossover networks. It meets all the technical requirements for professional use, including 64-bit precision processing, appropriate dithering in the final stage, and low-latency processing via ASIO drivers. The achievement of linear phase characteristics with FIR filters represents a technical advantage not possible with IIR filter-based competitors. However, from the perspective of current digital signal processing technology, these techniques are well-established, and their innovativeness is limited. The complexity of the interface and high learning curve indicate challenges in usability design rather than technical completeness.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The value for money of the flagship product Acourate (€416) is reasonable when compared to its direct competitors. Juice Hifi's Audiolense XO, which has comparable high-precision correction capabilities, is sold for €370. Based on our review policy, this results in `CP = 370 ÷ 416 ≒ 0.89`. Considering Acourate's unique features like ICPA, this price difference is fully justified. As a professional software with an integrated workflow, advanced functionality, and a dedicated support system unattainable with free tools, its pricing is considered legitimate.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AudioVero e.K.'s reliability and support system are good. Having provided continuous product development and customer support for over 17 years since its founding in 2007, the company's stability is proven. On the Acourate User Group, developer Dr. Uli Brueggemann himself participates in technical support, maintaining a system where he directly answers user questions. Major updates are offered through a paid upgrade path, while minor updates are provided for free, a clear policy. However, software installation requires a PC ID number, and license management can be overly strict. Additionally, the quality of documentation has been described as 'difficult to understand' in multiple user reviews, indicating room for improvement in beginner support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

AudioVero e.K.'s design philosophy is very rational, but there is room for improvement. The scientific approach of pursuing 'true acoustic reproduction' based on measurable physical phenomena is consistent and highly commendable. Linear phase correction with FIR filters is a technically optimal choice. However, the interface that delivers this advanced functionality to the user is complex and demands a high learning curve. A lack of consideration for AI-driven automation and a more intuitive user experience, expected in modern software, is a slight negative from a rationality standpoint. While it can be seen as a design philosophy tailored for professional tools, it presents challenges in terms of making its value accessible to a wider range of users.

## Advice

AudioVero e.K.'s Acourate is a very strong option for professionals and knowledgeable audio enthusiasts seeking the best in acoustic correction. When considering a purchase, it is recommended to compare its features and usability with its direct competitor, Audiolense XO, to determine which better suits your needs. This product is the optimal choice, especially if you value Acourate's unique ICPA feature. While it requires a significant amount of time to learn, it provides a level of precise sound field correction that justifies the investment. The technical support is excellent, but note that it is primarily offered in German and English.
