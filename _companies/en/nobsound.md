summary: "A Chinese brand offering low-priced products. However, it faces numerous challenges, including discrepancies between nominal and measured specs, irrational design philosophies using vacuum tubes, and a limited technology level. Its cost-performance is also limited, resulting in a low overall evaluation."

## Overview

Nobsound is an audio brand operated by Shenzhen Cavins Technology Co., LTD, established in 2014 in Shenzhen, China. The company primarily develops low-price Class-D amplifiers, DAC-integrated amplifiers, and tube hybrid products using Texas Instruments chips such as TPA3116D2 and TPA3221. The company also operates under the Douk Audio brand and sells worldwide mainly through Amazon and AliExpress. Their corporate philosophy focuses on providing affordable audio experiences for entry-level audio enthusiasts, establishing a certain position in the Chi-Fi (Chinese Hi-Fi) market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Actual measurement data for their flagship NS-DAC3 Pro shows approximately 9x deviation with a measured THD of 0.009% against the specified 0.001%. Its SINAD value of 81dB is also inferior compared to competing products. Products using the TPA3116D2 chip achieve performance close to its theoretical maximum (THD 0.1%, SNR 102dB), but the NS-13G and NS-15G also show discrepancies with measured THD of 0.01% and SNR of 98dB. While the frequency response generally meets the 20Hz-20kHz range, they fail to reach the transparent level in our measurement criteria table (THD 0.01% or below, SNR 105dB or above). Although performance within the audible threshold is achieved, the deviation between specifications and measured values raises concerns about scientific reliability.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The technology is primarily based on combinations of off-the-shelf chips, with most designs centered on Texas Instruments Class-D amplifier chips like TPA3116D2, TPA3221, and TPA3255. The NS-08E adopts a hybrid configuration with 6J3 vacuum tubes and transistors, but this is a conventional design method. Original circuit design and patented technologies are limited, placing them at the level of OEM design assembly. Many implementations are based on chip manufacturer reference designs, resulting in a technology level evaluated as below the industry average. However, some technical added value is recognized for rational component selection within given budget constraints, distinguishing them from pure OEM products.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For a company-wide evaluation, we select the competitively priced tube hybrid representative NS-08E (50 USD, CP score 1.0) and the Class-D amplifier representative NS-13G (40 USD, CP score 0.35), which faces cheaper competition. The CP for the TPA3116D2-based NS-13G is based on a comparison with a 14 USD product using the same chip on Amazon (14 USD รท 40 USD = 0.35). Considering the larger number of Class-D products in their lineup, we weigh them accordingly and determine the overall score to be 0.5. While they have some price competitiveness in the entry-level market, they are not the cheapest option.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Established in 2014, the company has over 10 years of business continuity and holds a 4.1/5 rating from 11,550 reviews on Amazon. However, there are reports of counterfeit products, such as the MS-10D MKII with a cosmetic-only tube-like appearance, and quality control issues in some products. Details on warranty periods and repair systems are not disclosed, but standard return and exchange support through Amazon is available. As a Chinese manufacturer, their reliability is average, but their support system and RMA response are limited compared to premium brands. The evaluation of firmware update support is neutral as few of their products require it.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The business strategy of providing a low-cost audio experience is rational. However, the audio engineering design philosophy has many problems. Tube hybrid designs like the NS-08E, which intentionally add distortion to achieve a specific sound coloration, are an irrational and outdated approach from a high-fidelity perspective. Furthermore, the significant discrepancies between nominal specifications and measured values in many products cast fundamental doubt on the rationality of their design and quality control. While their cost-reduction efforts are noted, their rationality in aiming for faithful reproduction is judged to be low.

## Advice

Nobsound is an option for audio beginners assembling a system on a very tight budget. However, it is crucial to understand that their nominal specifications do not reflect actual performance and that quality can be inconsistent. When purchasing, it is strongly recommended to choose a sales channel that allows for easy returns and exchanges. It is especially important to recognize that tube-equipped models like the NS-08E are products that intentionally add distortion to alter the sound, which is the antithesis of high-fidelity reproduction. For those seeking higher performance and reliability, it is advisable to consider products with guaranteed measurement-based performance, such as the Fosi Audio V3, even within a similar price range.
