## Overview

Triangle is a French high-end acoustic speaker manufacturer founded in 1980 by Renaud de Vergnette in Soissons, France. Operating under the official name "Manufacture TRIANGLE Hi-Fi," the company has been developing and manufacturing hi-fi loudspeakers for over 40 years with manufacturing concentrated at their Soissons workshop 60 miles northeast of Paris. Triangle offers four main product categories: high-fidelity speakers (floorstanding, bookshelf, custom install), wireless speakers, turntables, and home cinema systems. Notable collections include Borea, Capella, Magellan 40th Anniversary, Esprit, and flagship Signature series. The company employs 23 people and maintains both French headquarters and US operations with global distribution networks.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Triangle's measured performance reveals mixed results across their product range. While sensitivity ratings consistently exceed industry averages at 90-93 dB indicating good efficiency, several concerning patterns emerge from third-party measurements [1]. The Borea BR03's frequency response of 46 Hz – 22 kHz (±3 dB) sits at the borderline of problematic threshold, with independent testing revealing frequency response variations and elevated sibilance in 4-8kHz range. More concerning are impedance characteristics documented in professional measurements: BR03 shows minimum impedance of 4.2 ohms, presenting a moderately low amplifier load. Load characteristics vary by model, so the brand cannot be characterized as consistently operating at 2-4 ohms across the board. Harmonic and multitone distortion measurements indicate elevated levels compared to transparent thresholds. These measurement irregularities place Triangle's performance between problematic and transparent levels according to scientific criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Triangle demonstrates solid technical advancement through proprietary innovations developed over four decades. The EFS (Efficient Flow System) represents next-generation tweeter technology combining 25mm silk domes with specifically developed phase plugs to reduce directivity [2]. The DVAS (Driver Vibration Absorption System) provides proprietary vibration control unique to Triangle [3]. In-house design and manufacturing at Soissons facility demonstrates complete engineering control from R&D and prototyping to acoustic testing and final assembly, with accumulated expertise evident in refined driver geometries and crossover designs. Horn-loaded tweeters with titanium domes represent desirable technology competitors adopt. The company maintains strong patent portfolio and technical papers supporting their innovations. However, Triangle maintains primarily analog/mechanical approaches without significant digital integration, active correction, or cutting-edge technology adoption characterizing current industry leaders. Their innovations, while proprietary and technically sophisticated, represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary advances in speaker technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Company-wide cost-performance evaluation using Triangle representative product Borea BR03 bookshelf (349 USD) with confirmed third-party measurement data. BR03 is used as representative. The world's cheapest equivalent-or-better product with equivalent functionality and measured performance is ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 at 300 USD. B6.2 provides equivalent passive speaker functionality. Measured performance comparison: compared to BR03's frequency response 46 Hz – 22 kHz (±3 dB) and minimum impedance 4.2 ohms, B6.2 shows superior frequency response linearity and impedance characteristics confirmed by third-party measurements (CTA-2034/Spinorama) [1][4][5]. No passive bookshelf speakers under 300 USD with equivalent-or-better measured performance and third-party measurement data were found. Calculation methodology: CP = 300÷349 = 0.86, rounded to 0.9.
## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Triangle demonstrates above-average reliability and support infrastructure built over four decades. Standard warranty is 2 years. Eligible products can receive extended warranty through registration, but turntables are excluded. Extension terms differ: active speakers receive +1 year (total 3 years), passive speakers can extend up to 3 years maximum, with conditions varying by product [6]. Global support includes US operations and French headquarters with dedicated customer service [7]. The 30-day home trial policy reduces purchase risk [6]. Simple speaker construction using proven technologies (paper cones, horn tweeters, passive crossovers) provides inherently robust design resistant to component failure compared to complex active systems. Manufacturing concentration at Soissons facility with experienced workforce (some employees 35+ years) ensures consistent quality control and accumulated production expertise [8]. Triangle's 40+ year operational history demonstrates proven business stability, continuous parts availability, and established repair networks. Company focus on repairability as core value supports long-term product support expectations with serviceable components and traditional construction methods facilitating maintenance.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Triangle's design philosophy prioritizes subjective "emotion" and musical feeling over scientific measurement and objective performance improvement [9]. Marketing consistently emphasizes "sharing the emotion of live performance" and reproducing "all the emotion of music" rather than transparent audio reproduction or measurement-driven optimization. The company's commitment to traditional approaches including paper membrane drivers, analog circuitry, and emotion-focused tuning contradicts scientific evidence favoring materials and technologies with superior measured performance. French manufacturing adds costs not directly contributing to acoustic performance improvement while maintaining heritage positioning. Triangle's conservative approach maintains established technologies rather than adopting cutting-edge digital signal processing, active correction, room optimization, or measurement-driven design methodologies proven effective in modern speaker development. While proprietary EFS and DVAS systems demonstrate innovation, the fundamental philosophy remains subjectively-oriented rather than scientifically rational. The emphasis on craftsmanship, heritage, and emotional connection over technological advancement results in design decisions based on tradition and subjective preferences rather than measurable acoustic improvement.

## Advice

Triangle appeals to buyers seeking traditional French acoustic engineering with emphasis on musical emotion over scientific optimization. However, the systematic cost-performance disadvantage across multiple product lines compared to alternatives with better measured linearity presents a significant challenge for value-conscious buyers. Extended warranty support, global service infrastructure, and established manufacturing history provide reasonable ownership security for traditional speaker designs. Buyers prioritizing scientifically transparent reproduction should consider alternatives with better measured linearity, lower distortion, and superior impedance characteristics at substantially lower cost across all price segments. The subjective design philosophy may not align with preferences for measurement-driven acoustic optimization or evidence-based performance evaluation. Triangle's products suit listeners valuing heritage craftsmanship, French audio traditions, and willing to accept both measured performance compromises and significant cost premiums for established acoustic approaches emphasizing sensitivity and traditional voicing over technical transparency.
