## Overview

Founded in 2004 by Israeli-American Alon Wolf, Magico began development in 1994 when Wolf, who studied at a conservatory, started pursuing the "perfect speaker system," achieving commercialization after 10 years of development. Currently, 35 skilled craftsmen manufacture all components in-house at a 9,000 square meter factory in Hayward, California.

The company offers three series - A, S, and M - covering a wide price range from the A1 (USD 6,500) to the M9 (approximately USD 700,000). The signature 6061-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum cabinets undergo rigorous quality control including 1,000-point laser interferometer measurements and comprehensive Klippel analyzer testing. In 2024, marking the 20th anniversary, the company continues technological innovation with the launch of new S5 and S2 models.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Magico receives high praise for its measurement-based design approach. All products undergo Klippel analyzer testing, with complete frequency response mapping through spherical measurements. Laser interferometer cabinet vibration measurements at 1,000 points thoroughly eliminate resonances. Stereophile measurements show favorable results for many models, with the S3 2023 achieving 30% noise reduction compared to previous versions. Audio Science Review recognizes their technical competence as "one of the few genuine efforts in HEA engineering."

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Magico demonstrates industry-leading technical capabilities. Their precision CNC machining of 6061-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum, innovative drivers combining graphene-reinforced carbon fiber with aluminum honeycomb cores, and third-generation chassis structure optimizing force distribution surpass competitors. The Nano-Tec v.8 cone introduced in the 2024 S5 achieves previously impossible simultaneous lightweight construction and vibration control. Through 3D simulation-based cabinet optimization and precision implementation of custom bracing and damping, they pursue sound quality improvement through purely engineering approaches.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Comparing the Magico A1 (USD 6,500) with the Genelec 8361A (approximately USD 7,000 per pair), which includes coaxial drivers, DSP, and amplifiers, the Genelec offers superior total cost value. Against the A3 (USD 9,600), the Revel F228Be at approximately USD 2,800 demonstrates extremely high measured performance, yielding CP = USD 2,800 ÷ USD 9,600 ≈ 0.29. In the S3 2023 class (USD 49,300), competitors like the KEF Blade Two Meta (approximately USD 21,000) can achieve equivalent or superior performance at lower prices. When evaluated purely on acoustic performance without regard to materials or manufacturing methods, numerous more cost-efficient alternatives exist.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The comprehensive Klippel testing for all units represents a unique industry quality assurance approach, resulting in extremely low defect rates at shipping. Aluminum cabinets exhibit minimal aging degradation and excel in long-term performance retention. Integrated production at the California factory ensures stable parts supply and repair services. However, repair costs tend to be proportionally high relative to product prices. With 20 years of accumulated technical expertise and comprehensive support systems across over 30 countries, the company maintains robust service capabilities.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The design approach is extremely rational. Pursuing the clear goal of a "perfect speaker system," the company continuously implements improvements based on measurement data. The adoption of aluminum cabinets represents a rational decision to eliminate individual variations and aging changes inherent in wood materials. Optimal designs leveraging material properties through graphene-reinforced carbon fiber and aluminum honeycomb demonstrate thorough engineering. Prioritizing functionality over aesthetic luxury, with every component directly contributing to acoustic performance improvement, exemplifies engineering-focused high-end audio design.

## Advice

Magico is a sincere manufacturer that "pursues sound quality through technical excellence." While prices are high, the investment is reliably reflected in sound quality improvements.

- **Engineering-focused audiophiles**: Measurement-backed design delivers performance improvements commensurate with investment. A3 and above models demonstrate true capabilities.
- **Budget-conscious buyers**: The A1 is the company's entry model, but with a USD 6,500 budget, alternatives like Revel F208 or Genelec 8361A offer superior performance options.
- **Long-term users**: Unlike wood, aluminum cabinets show minimal aging degradation, making them optimal for 20+ year use.
- **Professionals**: Clear measurement data and reliable performance suitable for studio monitoring applications.

When considering purchase, strongly recommend comparative auditions with similarly priced Revel, Genelec, and KEF models. While Magico's technical competence is genuine, whether the value justifies the price depends on individual priorities.
