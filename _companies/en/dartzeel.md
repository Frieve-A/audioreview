## Overview

darTZeel Audio SA is a Swiss ultra–high-end amplifier manufacturer founded in 2001 by electronic engineer Hervé Delétraz in Geneva. The company name combines the founder's surname with references to ReVox typography and Zener diodes. Known for distinctive see-through chassis and zero global negative feedback topology, darTZeel produces handmade amplifiers including the flagship NHB-468 monoblocks (260,700 USD/pair) and integrated amplifiers like the CTH-8550 (41,184 USD). All products are manufactured in Geneva with Swiss precision engineering.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Measured performance is above average but not at transparent levels. Stereophile measurements show the NHB-108 model two reaches 0.118% THD+N at 50 W into 8 Ω with A-weighted S/N up to ~102 dB depending on channel and bandwidth, while the NHB-468 shows A-weighted S/N of 87.2 dB referenced to 2.83 V (1 W/8 Ω) and ~0.073% THD+N at ~52 W/8 Ω. Frequency response is extremely wide and flat, reflecting excellent small-signal linearity. Nevertheless, darTZeel’s zero global negative feedback philosophy systematically yields higher harmonic distortion than modern transparent amplifiers that achieve ≤0.01% THD+N and ≥120 dB S/N. These results justify an above-average score but not transparency.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The brand exhibits high technological sophistication: proprietary no-global-feedback circuitry, distinctive mechanical design (transparent chassis sections), and meticulous Swiss manufacturing. Development cycles (e.g., nine years on NHB-468) and in-house design control reflect deep know-how. However, the technology emphasizes a particular sonic aesthetic over maximizing measured transparency.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Cost-performance is extremely poor. Using darTZeel’s current flagship as the company representative, NHB-468 monoblocks are 260,700 USD/pair. The Benchmark AHB2 (single stereo unit) delivers objectively superior or equal user-facing performance metrics—THD+N ≈ 0.00013% (-118 dB), A-weighted S/N 132 dB, and in bridged-mono 380 W into 8 Ω—meeting or exceeding power capability with far lower distortion and noise. **Equivalence note:** The AHB2 provides the same core function (power amplification) with equal-or-better distortion, noise, bandwidth, damping, and sufficient output power (stereo or bridged) for the same use cases.

Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator price (AHB2): 3,499 USD (single unit). Using the company-flagship NHB-468 pair price as denominator per policy:

CP = 3,499 ÷ 260,700 = 0.0134 → 0.0 (score range clamp).

Even considering darTZeel’s integrated CTH-8550 at 41,184 USD, the same comparator (AHB2) still offers superior measured performance at a fraction of the price. The high premiums reflect artisanal construction and exclusivity rather than proportional performance advantage.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Swiss build quality is robust, but support has constraints. Warranty and service are dealer-centric; registration is required; grey-market units are excluded. As of 2024 the company restructured toward build-to-order while maintaining after-sales service for existing customers. Lack of a broad global service network and strict warranty rules weigh on the score despite solid construction.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The “listen first, measure later” stance and intentional avoidance of global feedback prioritize a particular harmonic profile over minimizing distortion and noise. While this can be subjectively appealing, it conflicts with evidence-based approaches aimed at transparent reproduction. Large, costly enclosures and artisanal execution do not translate into objectively superior measured results.

## Advice

darTZeel suits collectors who value Swiss craftsmanship, exclusivity, and unique aesthetics over price-to-performance. For buyers seeking state-of-the-art measured transparency at rational cost, products such as the Benchmark AHB2 (0.00013% THD+N, 132 dB S/N, 380 W/8 Ω bridged) provide far better objective performance at orders-of-magnitude lower prices.
