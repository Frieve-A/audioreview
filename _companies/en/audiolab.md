## Overview

Audiolab is a British audio manufacturer established in 1983, positioned for over 40 years as a benchmark for "affordable hi-fi electronics." Founded by Philip Swift and Derek Scotland, the company emerged from dissatisfaction with expensive hi-fi equipment. Their main products include integrated amplifiers from the 6000, 8000, and 9000 series, backed by a 3-year warranty.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Based on published specifications, products reach transparency-level performance. The 6000A is specified at THD <0.003% and S/N >110 dB, the 8300A at S/N >107 dB and THD <0.001%, and the 9000A at THD <0.0004% and S/N >117 dB. These meet or exceed typical transparency thresholds such as THD below 0.01% and S/N above 105 dB.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Designs primarily integrate commodity DAC chips and analog ICs in well-executed circuits to achieve strong measurements. Truly novel in-house technologies appear limited, and the approach is relatively easy to replicate. While above industry average, it falls short of the highest frontier.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Comparable functionality and measurement transparency can be achieved with general-purpose components at lower total cost (e.g., Topping E30 II DAC ≈ USD 149 + Fosi Audio V3 power amp ≈ USD 89 + ART DJ Pre II MM phono ≈ USD 69 → total ≈ USD 307). Using a typical market price for the 6000A around USD 760, calculation: 307 USD ÷ 760 USD ≈ 0.40 → 0.4 (rounded). Convenience of a single chassis is sacrificed, but user-facing functions and measured transparency can be matched; thus CP is 0.4.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Officially, a 3-year warranty is provided upon online registration (with conditions). No public RMA ratio or MTBF statistics were found. While scattered user reports of individual faults exist, without statistically robust data, we assign a conservative 0.3.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Design approach targeting transparency level achievement is extremely rational. Design philosophy based on scientific evidence includes CFB technology for improved linearity, ESS Sabre DAC adoption, and adequate power supply capacity. The stance of eliminating non-scientific occult elements while focusing on measurable performance improvements is highly commendable. Features like multiple DAC filter selection are rationally provided as measurement characteristic differences rather than user preferences. Design philosophy itself is excellent, with problems residing in implementation, manufacturing, and support aspects.

## Advice

Purchase may be considered with caution. Measurement performance and design philosophy are strong, but alternatives offer similar functionality at lower costs. Chinese integrated amps provide comparable measurements at reduced prices, while reliability reports suggest risks. For budget focus, explore competitive options; for assured support, consider established brands. No strong justification for premium unless valuing British origin.
