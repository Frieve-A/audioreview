## Overview

Ultrasone AG was founded in December 1990 in Tutzing, Germany by Florian M. König, with the first products launched in 1991. The company has built over 30 years of expertise in studio, DJ, and consumer headphones, centered around their proprietary S-Logic technology. They emphasize "Made in Germany" quality through handcrafted manufacturing in their own facilities. The company holds more than 60 patents and features distinctive EMI shielding technology (ULE) for health consideration.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The company's measurement performance is problematic by modern standards. The Pro 900 claims 6Hz-42kHz frequency response, but actual measurements from Reference Audio Analyzer show significant dips around 9kHz and sharp peaks at 10kHz and 11.5kHz, causing harsh high-frequency characteristics. S-Logic technology is claimed to widen soundstage, but this is actually due to frequency response irregularities. The Edition 15's 40mm Mylar driver and Titanium-Gold Coating (GTC) technology show limited actual THD improvement effects. ULE technology claims 98% EMI reduction, but this doesn't directly correlate to audio quality improvement. Compared to modern high-performance DAC amplifiers, transparency levels are not achieved.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

S-Logic technology has been developed since 1991, with unique driver positioning worthy of evaluation. More than 60 patents demonstrate investment in technical development. Made in Germany handcrafted manufacturing and Edition 15's GTC technology show technical efforts. However, basic acoustic design centers on conventional dynamic drivers with limited innovation. Compared to competitors' advanced planar magnetic and electrostatic technologies, the technical level remains at industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The company's pricing is high. For example, the Signature MASTER MKII costs approximately 1,000 EUR (around 150,000 JPY), while equivalent performance Sennheiser HD6XX (199 USD/approximately 30,000 JPY) exists. Calculation: 30,000 JPY ÷ 150,000 JPY = 0.20, resulting in extremely poor cost-performance. The limited Edition 15 costs 2,999 USD with 999-unit limitation, but measurement performance is inferior to other products in the same price range. While "Made in Germany" brand value is included, pure performance-to-price ratio is inferior to competitors.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Handcrafted manufacturing in their German factory ensures good quality control. Over 30 years of corporate history and more than 60 patents provide high technical reliability. Environmental considerations including solar power systems, electric vehicle usage, and sustainable material selection demonstrate corporate social responsibility. Made in Germany brand quality assurance is market-recognized with expected long-term product support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

S-Logic technology's soundstage expansion approach is rational in terms of reproducing speaker listening experience. ULE technology's EMI shielding is understandable as health consideration. However, basic frequency response improvement is deprioritized, with inappropriate audio quality improvement priorities. Professional market specialization is rational, but measurement performance improvement is more important. Environmental initiatives are commendable, but greater technical investment in audio quality improvement is needed.

## Advice

Ultrasone can be an option for those seeking "Made in Germany" quality and S-Logic technology's unique soundstage characteristics, but cannot be recommended for those prioritizing pure audio performance. Particularly for professional applications emphasizing measurement performance, higher-performing competitive products should be considered. In the same price range, options like Focal, Beyerdynamic, and Sennheiser are more rational choices. For experiencing S-Logic technology's soundstage effects, consider purchasing from the used market to improve cost-performance.
