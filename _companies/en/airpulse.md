## Overview

AirPulse is a speaker brand owned by Platinum Audio Systems Company, founded in 2004 by renowned speaker designer Phil Jones in partnership with Edifier Technology Co., Ltd. Phil Jones previously founded Acoustic Energy in 1987 and designed the legendary AE-1 near-field monitors used in Abbey Road Studios. The company specializes in active bookshelf speakers featuring horn-loaded aluminum ribbon tweeters across their A-series lineup, including the A100, A200, and flagship A300. All models combine Phil Jones' acoustic engineering heritage with modern Class-D amplification and digital signal processing.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

AirPulse speakers demonstrate mixed measured performance according to Audio Science Review testing of the A100 model using Klippel Near-field Scanner equipment. Frequency response shows reasonable on-axis performance but horizontal directivity is described as "a bit narrow" with vertical issues creating a response ditch above tweeter axis. Distortion remains controlled at 86 dBSPL but becomes problematic at 96 dBSPL with audible modulation during measurement sweeps [1]. Quantitatively for A100 (far-field basis), preference rating is 4.7 (with sub: 7.1) and frequency-response spans are ±6.6 dB from 52 Hz–20 kHz and ±3.3 dB from 80 Hz–20 kHz [1]. Manufacturer-listed figures include frequency range 52 Hz–40 kHz and signal-to-noise ratio L/R ≥ 90 dB(A) [4]. Overall, results place the lineup around average for active monitors in scientific terms.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

AirPulse employs sophisticated technical implementation including horn-loaded aluminum ribbon tweeters derived from their flagship 7001 monitor design, aluminum cone drivers with underhung motor systems, and Texas Instruments TAS5754 Class-D amplification. The TAS5754 platform combines high input sample rate support with a high PWM carrier frequency [5]. Manufacturer specs state USB and optical inputs support up to 192 kHz input rates [4]. The ribbon tweeter technology represents genuine innovation in the consumer active monitor space, though the overall system integration and measured results don't fully capitalize on these advanced components. Phil Jones' engineering heritage adds credibility to the technical approach, with design elements traceable to professional monitor development.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

AirPulse speakers exhibit poor cost-performance compared to established alternatives. As a representative case, the A100 (USD 999.99) [4] faces the JBL 305P MkII (USD 159 each at Sweetwater; USD 318 per pair based on 2 units), which delivers equal-or-better user-facing functionality (active 2-way, 5-inch woofer, balanced inputs) and strong independent measurements [2][3].

- Equivalence basis (user perspective): 5-inch powered monitor with documented spinorama and low-distortion performance [2]; multiple analog inputs on A100 are not decisive for fidelity.
- Price basis: USD 999.99 (A100) vs USD 318 (305P MkII pair computed as 2 × USD 159) [3][4].

CP disclosure: 318 ÷ 999.99 = 0.318 → Cost-Performance score = 0.3 after rounding (CP = MIN(1.0, 318 ÷ 999.99)). Similarly, higher-priced AirPulse models face multiple studio monitors offering comparable or superior measured results at substantially lower prices. The premium pricing appears to reflect positioning and industrial design rather than clear performance advantages.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

AirPulse benefits from Edifier Technology's established manufacturing infrastructure and support network, providing reasonable warranty coverage and service accessibility. The partnership with a major audio manufacturer (Edifier) ensures parts availability and repair capabilities beyond what typical boutique speaker brands offer. However, as a relatively new brand (post-2004), long-term reliability data remains limited compared to established monitor manufacturers. Phil Jones' reputation for quality design provides some confidence, though individual product reliability will depend on Edifier's manufacturing execution rather than the designer's heritage.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

AirPulse pursues a rational technical approach emphasizing measured performance improvements through ribbon tweeter technology, proper acoustic design, and modern digital amplification. The focus on horn-loaded ribbon tweeters addresses legitimate technical challenges in tweeter dispersion and distortion, while Class-D amplification provides efficient power delivery. Phil Jones' background in professional monitor design brings scientific credibility to the development process. However, the premium pricing strategy for consumer active monitors conflicts with cost-effective approaches proven successful by studio monitor manufacturers, limiting the brand's practical impact on achieving transparent audio reproduction at accessible prices.

## Advice

AirPulse speakers represent competent engineering with attractive aesthetics but poor value propositions. Potential buyers seeking active monitors should consider JBL 305P MkII, KRK RP5, or similar professional alternatives offering superior cost-performance ratios. AirPulse products may appeal to consumers prioritizing Phil Jones heritage and ribbon tweeter technology over measured performance per dollar, but objective analysis favors established studio monitor alternatives for most applications.
