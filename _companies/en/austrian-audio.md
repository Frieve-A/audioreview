## Overview

Austrian Audio is an Austrian audio equipment manufacturer established in 2017 by former engineers from the AKG Vienna factory. The team, with a cumulative 350 years of engineering experience, has the mission of advancing AKG's traditional acoustic design with modern technology. Their flagship products, the OC818 and OC18 microphones, employ handcrafted CKR12 ceramic capsules and Open Acoustics Technology, earning high acclaim in the professional market. Although acquired by DPA Microphones in January 2024, they continue development and manufacturing in Vienna as an independent brand.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Austrian Audio's products demonstrate excellent measured performance. The flagship OC818/OC18 microphones achieve an extremely low self-noise level of 9 dB-A, which is an excellent value approaching the transparent level. The maximum SPL of 148 dB provides superior dynamic range, extendable to 158 dB/168 dB with -10 dB/-20 dB pads. The frequency response is generally flat across the 20 Hz-20 kHz range, with moderate presence enhancement around 5 kHz and air enhancement around 12 kHz, showing excellent performance both in measurements and audibly. The sensitivity of 13 mV/Pa is a standard value, and overall, the products achieve high performance meeting transparent-level measurement criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Austrian Audio's technology level ranks among the industry's highest standards. The CKR12 ceramic capsule, as a modern version of the legendary AKG CK12 capsule, significantly improves consistency and durability through precision handcrafted manufacturing. Open Acoustics Technology (OAT) minimizes acoustic interference through a free-floating design and reduces acoustic reflective surfaces around the capsule to achieve natural sound without resonance. The OC818's dual-membrane technology allows independent processing of front and rear signals, enabling post-production polar pattern control through PolarDesigner software. The new electronic design achieves an extremely low noise floor, achieving a high-level balance between technical innovation and practicality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Austrian Audio's cost-performance is limited. The OC818 (1250 USD) can be compared with the Aston Spirit (450 USD) as a professional-grade microphone with equivalent multi-polar functionality. The Aston Spirit supports three polar patterns (cardioid, omnidirectional, bidirectional) and provides sufficient sound quality and durability for professional studio use, making it a functional alternative to the OC818. Based on the calculation formula `450 USD รท 1250 USD = 0.36`, the score is 0.4 when rounded. While it has a price advantage compared to the Neumann U87 Ai (3595 USD), its absolute cost-performance is rated below average due to the existence of a more affordable, functionally equivalent alternative.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Austrian Audio's reliability and support system is at the industry average level. The product warranty is a standard 2 years, extendable to 3 years through product registration. For headphone products, they provide a 5-year warranty, demonstrating confidence in product quality. However, specific failure rate (RMA ratio) or MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) data is not publicly available. As a relatively new company established in 2017, its long-term reliability track record is still accumulating. While support systems are established, detailed information about regional support coverage in global expansion and firmware update support (not applicable for these products) is limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Austrian Audio's design philosophy is extremely rational and based on scientific evidence. Open Acoustics Technology follows acoustic physics principles to physically minimize acoustic interference around the capsule. In developing the CKR12 capsule, they adopted an empirical approach of measuring and analyzing the excellent CK12 capsule of the past, then reproducing and improving its acoustic characteristics with modern manufacturing technology. There are no pseudo-scientific marketing claims, and all technical features directly contribute to measurable sound quality improvements. Their direction of aiming for transparent-level sound quality through continuous technical improvement in new product development is highly commendable.

## Advice

Austrian Audio presents an extremely attractive option for users seeking professional-quality microphones. The OC818, in particular, offers performance comparable to the Neumann U87 in both versatility and sound quality at a significantly lower price, making it broadly recommendable for professional and home studios alike. The OC18 is an even better value for users who only need a single polar pattern. However, if budget is the top priority, more affordable single-pattern condenser microphones like the LCT 440 PURE are also worth considering. For professionals who value the balance of quality and price and want to choose a brand with future potential, Austrian Audio products are a definite investment. The brand's future technological advancements and product launches are highly anticipated.
