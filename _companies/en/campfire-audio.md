summary: "Boutique IEM manufacturer based in Portland, America, founded in 2015. Split from ALO Audio led by Ken Ball, achieving high acclaim through hand assembly and unique acoustic tuning. Flagship models like Andromeda and Solaris are expensive at USD 1,000-1,800 but have passionate fans for their musical appeal and distinctive sound. Their approach emphasizing listening-based adjustments over measurement data and differentiation through physical acoustic design is unique. However, from a cost-performance perspective, competitiveness with other companies presents challenges."

## Overview

Campfire Audio is a boutique IEM manufacturer based in Portland, Oregon, USA, founded by Ken Ball in 2015. Ken Ball founded Audio Line Out in 2009, establishing a reputation with high-end audio cables as ALO Audio before spinning off Campfire Audio. The company's characteristic is hand-assembling all products in their Portland workshop.

The company prioritizes listening-based adjustments over measurement data, pursuing musical appeal under Ken Ball's philosophy that "earphones with flat frequency response graphs sound like wilted cabbage." Flagship models like Andromeda (USD 1,000) and Solaris (USD 1,800) have gained passionate fans with their distinctive sound that transcends conventional measurement standards. Their approach of avoiding passive components and crossovers, adjusting through physical acoustic design (chambers and resonators) is also characteristic.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Campfire Audio's development methodology differs significantly from conventional measurement-focused approaches. The company avoids publishing frequency response graphs, taking the stance that "measurement data and actual listening perception don't match." This attitude raises questions from a scientific verification perspective. Meanwhile, the company's products receive high ratings in many independent reviews, achieving certain results in subjective sound quality. However, results from ABX tests and blind trials for objective verification are limited, and more proactive approaches to presenting scientific evidence are expected. While their focus on physical acoustic design is commendable, quantitative proof of its effects remains insufficient.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company's technical characteristics lie in unique physical acoustic design. Andromeda's 5-driver dual-diaphragm balanced armature configuration and Solaris's 10mm dynamic driver with radial venting technology demonstrate approaches different from conventional designs. Oregon-sourced billet aluminum housing machining and hand assembly techniques are at high standards. However, drivers themselves depend on external sourcing and are not completely proprietary development. While introducing new technologies like 3D printing for driver housings, they haven't reached industry-leading innovative technology development.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Products with equivalent frequency response and sensitivity to Andromeda (USD 1,000) exist at USD 400 such as Moondrop Variations or FiiO FH9 (USD 433), yielding CP = USD 400 รท USD 1,000 = 0.4. For hybrid IEMs with performance equivalent to Solaris (USD 1,800), ThieAudio Monarch MK3 (approximately USD 733) shows equal or superior measured performance, yielding CP = USD 733 รท USD 1,800 = 0.41. For balanced armature configuration products equivalent to Comet (USD 133), CCA CRA exists at USD 53, yielding CP = USD 53 รท USD 133 = 0.4. While the company's products have rarity from hand assembly and limited production, price efficiency for pure acoustic performance is low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Hand assembly in the Portland workshop provides high reliability in quality control. Each product is individually inspected and evaluated, minimizing variation in finished product quality. After-sales service as an American product is also comprehensive with prompt repair response. Their track record since 2009 as ALO Audio also provides reliability foundation. However, due to hand production, supply stability has limitations compared to mass-produced items. Product warranty is at standard levels without special services like extended warranties.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company's design philosophy shows many acoustically rational aspects. The approach of avoiding passive components and tuning through physical acoustic design makes sense from the perspective of maintaining signal path purity. Adjustment methods utilizing chambers and resonators are also acoustically effective means. The concept of "mismatch between measurement data and listening perception" is understandable considering headphone/IEM characteristics. However, complete disregard for measurement data deviates from scientific approaches, requiring balance between both. The commitment to hand assembly is also rational from a quality control perspective.

## Advice

They provide a product lineup suitable for users who prioritize listening-based sound quality evaluation.

- **Product by price range**: Comet (USD 133) balanced armature configuration, Andromeda (USD 1,000) 5-driver dual-diaphragm configuration, Solaris (USD 1,800) hybrid configuration available.
- **Manufacturing method**: Hand assembly in Portland workshop, Oregon-sourced billet aluminum housing.
- **Design features**: No passive components or crossovers, physical acoustic design adopted.

Pre-audition is recommended. Purchase from authorized dealers enables after-sales service.
