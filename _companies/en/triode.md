## Overview

Triode is a Japanese tube amplifier specialist established in 1994 by Jun'ichi Yamazaki in Koshigaya, Saitama Prefecture. Starting from a small garage operation, the company now manufactures a broad range of tube amplifiers (integrated and power amplifiers) employing classic topologies such as single-ended 300B and push-pull KT88, serving tube enthusiasts in Japan and abroad.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Publicly verified, independent, systematic measurement data for the lineup is limited. In accordance with the policy, when measured performance is unclear, the score starts at 0.5. Tube circuits typically exhibit higher harmonic distortion and lower SNR than state-of-the-art semiconductor designs; if comprehensive third-party measurements are published confirming transparency-level performance, this score should be revised accordingly.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The company demonstrates competent technical skills in vacuum tube circuit design, remaining broadly at industry-average levels for tube amplifier manufacturers. Designs employ established tube topologies and transformer-coupled output stages that satisfy typical category requirements. Compared with modern semiconductor-based implementations, more cost‑effective approaches exist to achieve superior measured transparency; originality and advancement are therefore evaluated as moderate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Against the Evolution 300's price of 19,999 USD, there exists the Fosi Audio V3 (approximately 150 USD) offering equivalent or better functionality and performance. Both products provide basic integrated amplifier functions, with V3 surpassing in measured performance: SNR (V3: 110dB+ vs Evolution 300: 93dB) and THD+N (V3: 0.003% vs Evolution 300: tube-characteristic harmonic distortion) [1]. Calculation: 150 USD ÷ 19,999 USD = 0.0075. Similarly, the Evolution Musashi (5,000 USD) is also high-priced. From an acoustic engineering perspective, alternative means exist to achieve superior performance at lower prices, resulting in poor cost-performance evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Established in 1994 with a long business history, the company emphasizes quality control through handcrafted manufacturing. Domestic Japanese production supports consistent build quality. However, because vacuum tubes are consumable components, regular maintenance and tube replacement are expected, and long‑term reliability is generally inferior to solid‑state products. Information about international support coverage is limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The brand prioritizes tube-character sound for enthusiasts rather than measured transparency. Compared to modern digital/semiconductor approaches, advantages in measured performance and price rationality are limited; from a science-first standpoint this yields a low score. The value proposition for users specifically seeking tube traits remains clear.

## Advice

Triode products offer value for enthusiasts seeking tube-characteristic sound properties, but cannot be recommended for purchasers prioritizing objective audio performance. The functionality and performance equivalent to their high-end Evolution 300 (19,999 USD) can be achieved with modern Class D amplifiers at less than 1/100 the price. Unless you're an enthusiast who values the visual and emotional aspects of tubes and doesn't mind regular maintenance, we strongly recommend considering products adopting more rational modern technology.
