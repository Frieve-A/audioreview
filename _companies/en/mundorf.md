summary: "German audio capacitor manufacturer Mundorf. Established in 1985, this veteran company is falling behind in performance compared to modern technology. Despite high pricing, general-purpose components with equivalent functionality are available at dramatically lower prices."

## Overview

Mundorf is a German audio electronic component manufacturer founded in 1985 in Cologne. Their main products include capacitors, inductors, and resistors, with particular recognition for their MCap® series capacitors. The company launched MCap® SUPREME Classic in 1992, establishing a benchmark for audiophile capacitors. Currently operating under the motto "Inner Excellence," they emphasize handcraft manufacturing processes in their product development.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Passive components such as capacitors, inductors, and resistors can achieve transparent levels of audio impact when properly specified. While the company's products fulfill basic electronic component functions, objective performance comparisons using modern high-precision measuring instruments show no notable advantages. Basic frequency characteristics and low distortion properties of film capacitors are achieved, but these are now common technologies. Premium grades using silver-gold alloys also lack scientifically proven practical improvement effects in the audible range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Since its 1985 founding, the company has developed proprietary winding techniques for film capacitors and special aluminum can sealing technology. Technical accumulation is recognized in areas such as winding patterns for the MCap® SUPREME series and thick-film aluminum deposition technology for self-healing PP (polypropylene) films. However, these technologies represent 1990s to 2000s standards and lack innovation compared to current electronic component technology. Manual manufacturing processes are not contemporary from quality uniformity and productivity perspectives.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Compared to general-purpose electronic components with equivalent functionality, the price difference is extremely large. For example, while Mundorf MCap Supreme 1.0μF/630V sells for approximately 5,000 JPY, equivalent capacitance and voltage rating Panasonic ECQ-E6105KF (1μF/630V metallized polyester film capacitor) can be obtained for about 200 JPY. CP = 200 JPY ÷ 5,000 JPY = 0.04. Since this calculated value is below 0.05, the score rounds to 0.0. There is no difference in practical performance for audio applications, making the 25x price difference unreasonable. Similar situations exist for inductors and resistors, where general-purpose components with equivalent electrical characteristics are available at less than 1/10 the price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As a veteran company established in 1985, basic product quality is stable. Manufacturing systems are maintained in Germany with appropriate quality control considerations. However, information about warranty periods and repair support is limited. Domestic support systems through authorized dealers in Japan are also limited, with no expectation for technical inquiries or failure response. Long-term reliability is at general electronic component levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design philosophy of differentiating basic electronic components as "audio-specific" lacks rationality from modern scientific perspectives. Significant costs are invested in improvements like silver-gold alloy usage and special winding patterns, where measurable differences don't exceed human auditory thresholds. Manual manufacturing processes are also not contemporary from quality uniformity and reproducibility perspectives. Given that general-purpose components with equivalent electrical characteristics are supplied at low prices through mass production, the necessity for specialized audio components is questionable.

## Advice

While Mundorf has a long track record as an audio electronic component manufacturer, it cannot be recommended from a modern scientific perspective. Passive components like capacitors, inductors, and resistors can achieve sufficient performance with appropriately specified general-purpose components. For example, crossover circuit capacitors can be served by Panasonic ECQ-E6105KF or Nichicon general-purpose film capacitors at less than 1/10 the price with equivalent performance. The same applies to inductors, where audio quality differences due to winding techniques are not scientifically proven. If budget exists for Mundorf products, it should be invested in more fundamental audio improvement elements (speaker units or amplifier measured performance improvements). It's important to avoid audio mythology and make judgments based on objective performance and price.
