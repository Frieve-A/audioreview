## Overview

64 Audio is a premium in-ear monitor manufacturer based in the United States, specializing in custom and universal IEMs for professional musicians and audiophiles. The company's lineup spans from compact hybrids to 18-driver flagships, and it markets several proprietary technologies: tia (Tubeless In-Ear Audio), apex (Air Pressure Exchange), and LID (Linear Impedance Design). All products are designed, assembled, and QC'd in the U.S. with globally sourced components.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

64 Audio publishes concrete, user-relevant parameters for its proprietary features. Apex modules specify passive isolation levels of -10 dB, -15 dB, and -20 dB, quantifying the trade-off between pressure relief and attenuation [1][3]. LID is described as an electrical network that linearizes the earphone's impedance so that frequency response remains consistent across sources with different output impedances (e.g., smartphones, DAPs, body-packs) [4]. Third-party measurement content for 64 Audio's top models is available: multiple reviews of the U12t include frequency-response graphs measured on IEC-711/GRAS rigs and module comparisons [5][6]. However, independently published distortion and isolation datasets remain sparse across the portfolio, so full verification against transparency-level targets (e.g., THD <0.05%, isolation -30 dB across the band for passive IEMs) is incomplete.

**Key quantified facts used:** Apex module isolation: m20 → -20 dB, m15 → -15 dB, mX → -10 dB [1][3]; U12t third-party FR measurements exist on GRAS/IEC-711 rigs [5][6].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

64 Audio demonstrates sustained, substantive innovation in IEM acoustics. The tia system uses open BA drivers and a single-bore architecture to reduce tube-related resonances (an approach other manufacturers are unlikely to replicate quickly) [2]. Apex addresses the physiological issue of sealed-canal pressure without abandoning passive isolation, publishing clear attenuation figures per module [1][3]. LID targets a real-world problem—source-dependent FR shifts—by equalizing impedance interaction for consistent tonality [4]. Collectively these mechanisms represent durable know-how and a coherent engineering roadmap focused on measurable outcomes rather than cosmetic differentiation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Company-level CP is a weighted average of representative current models**, compared against the **cheapest product that is equal-or-better in user-visible functions and measured performance** (wired playback, detachable cable, strong passive isolation, accurate/flat tuning). For neutral listening with high isolation, **Etymotic ER2SE (regular price 149.99 USD)** satisfies those requirements: wired UIEM with detachable cable and **35-42 dB** passive isolation (manufacturer spec) and a flat-tuned response [7].  

Representative 64 Audio models and current prices:

- **U4s** → 1,099 USD [8]  
- **Nio** → 1,699 USD [1]  
- **U12t** → 1,999 USD [9]

**Equivalence note (ER2SE → neutral monitoring use):** wired UIEM, detachable cable, **isolation 35-42 dB** (→ apex m20's -20 dB), flat studio-oriented tuning (manufacturer) → functions and key measured axes (FR shape for neutrality; passive isolation magnitude) are **equivalent-or-better** for transparency-focused use [7].

**Per-model CP (formula: CP = MIN(1.0, cheapest-equivalent price ÷ target price)):**

- U4s: 149.99 ÷ 1,099 = **0.14**  
- Nio: 149.99 ÷ 1,699 = **0.09**  
- U12t: 149.99 ÷ 1,999 = **0.08**

**Simple equal weighting** across the three yields a company CP ≈ **0.10**, reflected in the score above. (Temporary sales and used/auction prices are excluded; list/regular prices are used.) Prices verified on 64 Audio and Etymotic official pages [1][7][8][9].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

64 Audio manufactures and services its products in the U.S. with global distribution. The modular apex system is field-swappable, and the brand provides model-specific accessories and support pages. As a specialist manufacturer, service access is solid but naturally not as ubiquitous as mass-market CE brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company's roadmap targets audible, measurable issues: tube resonances (tia), ear-canal pressure (apex), and source-dependent FR variance (LID). Public documentation emphasizes mechanisms and user-visible outcomes rather than romantic narratives, aligning with a measurement-first stance [2][3][4][5][6].

## Advice

Choose 64 Audio if you specifically value **pressure-relief modules (apex)** and **source-consistent tonality (LID)** alongside high build quality; these are distinctive user benefits [1][3][4]. If your priority is **maximum transparency per dollar** with strong passive isolation for tracking/mixing or commuting, an option like **Etymotic ER2SE** delivers much of the neutrality/isolation brief at a dramatically lower price [7]. Within 64 Audio's range, the **U12t** remains a safe all-rounder supported by third-party FR data [5][6], while models like **U4s** and **Nio** trade isolation and tunability via apex modules against price [1][8].
