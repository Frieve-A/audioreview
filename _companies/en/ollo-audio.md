## Overview

OLLO Audio is a manufacturer producing handcrafted studio headphones in the foothills of the Slovenian Alps. Beginning full-scale product development in the late 2010s, they specialize in headphones designed for professional monitoring applications. The company has earned trust from mixing and recording engineers working with renowned artists including Adele, U2, Ed Sheeran, Rihanna, and Sting, characterized by their high-precision acoustic management through the individual calibration system UCS II. Current flagship products include the flagship X1, open-back S4X, and closed-back S4R models.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

OLLO Audio products achieve excellent measured performance figures. The flagship X1 realizes THD of 0.05%, meeting the excellent criterion of 0.05% or less for the headphone category. The S4X series also shows THD under 0.084% and the S4R series under 0.079%, demonstrating good distortion performance significantly below the problematic level of 0.5%. Frequency response achieves precision within ±2dB in standard condition, with extremely high precision adjustment possible within ±1dB when the individual calibration UCS II system is applied. Through scientific approaches using G.R.A.S. 45CC measurement equipment and quality control measurements on all units, they pursue rational efforts toward ensuring transparency in the audible range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The individual calibration system UCS II represents a unique approach in the industry, showing advancement through AI-processed calibration data generation and Realphones technology integration. They possess technical uniqueness through specialized measurement environment construction in collaboration with Dewesoft, handcrafted housing design combining American walnut and stainless steel. However, fundamentally they remain within conventional dynamic driver technology and have not achieved industry-leading innovative technological development. While measurement precision improvement and added value creation through software integration are commendable, no revolutionary progress is observed in fundamental acoustic conversion technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Competitive products exist that provide equivalent or superior performance at significantly lower prices for closed-back studio monitor functionality. For the S4X (400 USD), comparison with equivalent-function Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (159 USD) and Sony MDR-7506 (99 USD) yields 159 USD ÷ 400 USD = 0.40 and 99 USD ÷ 400 USD = 0.25. For the X1 (539 USD), Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro (169 USD) provides equivalent professional specifications, resulting in 169 USD ÷ 539 USD = 0.31. The average of these is approximately 0.32, evaluated as 0.3. Price advantage is limited in providing equivalent studio monitoring functionality, requiring improvement in cost-performance aspects.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The 5-year extended warranty represents industry-leading standards, with full coverage for the initial 2 years and limited warranty covering repair costs for the remaining 3 years. Service centers are positioned in the United States, United Kingdom, and EU countries, establishing rapid support systems with 48-hour response as standard. Support systems emphasizing usability are comprehensive, including 90-day trial periods, DHL pickup service, and designs enabling component replacement at home. Continuous usage records in major artists' recording sessions serve as testimony to product reliability, with durability in professional environments also proven.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The product development approach based on scientific measurement is extremely rational. They maintain a development stance faithful to measurement science through objective evaluation using G.R.A.S. measurement equipment, comprehensive inspection systems considering individual differences, and transparent disclosure of measurement conditions and data processing procedures. The direction of purely pursuing acoustic characteristic improvement while eliminating occult claims and unscientific marketing is highly commendable. Through studio monitoring-dedicated design clarifying usage purposes, they realize tuning based on scientific standards such as Harman Target and studio standards. While within conventional technology scope, they pursue rational approaches toward achieving transparency levels through measurement precision improvement and thorough quality control.

## Advice

OLLO Audio is suitable for users who prioritize scientific approaches and professional quality. Individual calibration providing high-precision characteristics and comprehensive support systems offer value in professional applications, but careful consideration is necessary when emphasizing cost-performance. For professional users who prioritize acoustic precision in studio work and value measured performance and reliability over price, they can be recommended. Conversely, when seeking equivalent basic studio monitoring performance at lower cost, alternative choices such as Audio-Technica ATH-M50x, Sony MDR-7506, and Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro should also be considered. Utilizing the 90-day trial period to confirm compatibility in actual working environments is strongly recommended.
