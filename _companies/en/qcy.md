## Overview

QCY is a Shenzhen-based wireless audio specialist manufacturer that maintains an important position in the true wireless earbuds market as of 2025. The company primarily operates in the sub-30 USD price range for wireless earbuds and headphones, building a product lineup focused on cost-performance. Representative products include the T13 series and H3 series, achieving features like active noise cancellation, multipoint connection, and long battery life at low prices. Through sustained global market growth, brand recognition among budget-conscious users has steadily improved.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

QCY products provide standard acoustic performance for the low-price segment but do not reach transparent sound reproduction levels. The representative T13 ANC series employs 7.2mm dynamic drivers with bass-emphasized tuning, showing frequency response characteristics typical of budget earbuds with approximately Â±3dB deviation across 20Hz-20kHz, exhibiting mid-low frequency bloating and early high-frequency roll-off. THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) measurements exceed 0.1%, falling short of the excellent standard for headphones/earbuds (0.05% or below). While IPX5 water resistance and active noise cancellation features are included, ANC performance remains at 10-15dB levels, significantly below the excellent standard (30dB or above). Bluetooth 5.3 support ensures connection stability, but no scientific advantages in sound quality are recognized.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

QCY's technical level falls below industry average. Most products are based on standard configurations using existing OEM designs, with limited proprietary technology development. The T13 ANC series employs 7.2mm dynamic drivers and Bluetooth 5.3 chipsets, but these are merely combinations of common commercial components. The T13 ANC claims active noise cancellation functionality, but actual ANC performance remains at 10-15dB levels, significantly below industry-leading implementations. Codec support is limited to SBC and AAC, with no support for higher-quality aptX HD or LDAC. Design-wise, combinations of off-the-shelf products dominate, with no proprietary acoustic technologies or innovative feature development confirmed.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

QCY delivers the highest cost-performance in the budget ANC earbud market. The T13 ANC series is currently sold at 32.99 USD, and there are no cheaper alternatives on the market with comparable active noise cancellation features. Based on the review policy, the score is 1.0 as no cheaper competing product exists. Offering features like ANC, multipoint connection, and dedicated app support at this price point demonstrates a clear advantage over other competitors, making it one of the best choices for users who prioritize budget.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

QCY's reliability and support system maintains industry average standards. Basic product durability is secured, with IPX5 water resistance providing sufficient reliability for daily use. Battery life performs according to specifications, with the T13 series achieving 7.5 hours standalone and 40 hours with case. However, data on failure rates and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) for long-term use are not publicly available. Warranty period is standard at one year, with established global support infrastructure. Firmware update support is provided, but frequency and content are limited. Overall, the support system is evaluated as reasonable considering the price range.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

QCY's design philosophy is rationally designed for budget-conscious users. The strategy aims to maximize feature density at low prices, aligning with market needs. The T13 series achieves upper-tier features at low prices, including 4-microphone ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation), dedicated app EQ adjustment, and sleep mode functionality. However, sound quality emphasizes low frequencies, considered a commercial decision catering to general user preferences. The existence value as dedicated audio equipment maintains certain advantages compared to general smartphone audio performance. While design simplification for cost reduction is evident, rationality in the target market is high.

## Advice

For users seeking ANC-equipped wireless earbuds on a budget of around 33 USD, QCY currently represents the most cost-effective option on the market. The T13 ANC series, priced at 32.99 USD, provides features such as active noise cancellation, multipoint connection, and dedicated app support, with no cheaper competitors available. For users who prioritize maximum functionality within a limited budget over absolute sound quality or top-tier ANC performance, the QCY T13 ANC is the optimal choice. While considering higher-priced products is necessary for better performance, it would be difficult to find a better option if cost is the primary concern.
