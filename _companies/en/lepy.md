## Overview

Lepy is a China-based ultra-low-cost digital amplifier manufacturer. Known for mini amplifiers such as the LP-2024A+ (market price 20 USD), the company changed its brand name from "Lepai" to "Lepy" due to trademark issues. Their main products are small Class-D amplifiers sold for under 20 USD, targeting desktop audio and entry-level applications. However, significant discrepancies between measured performance and advertised specifications, along with widespread quality control problems, have been reported. Currently, numerous superior alternatives exist for a small additional investment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Measured data significantly underperforms advertised specifications. LP-2020A measurement results show actual low-distortion output limited to 3-5W at an 8Ω load, despite claiming 20W RMS. THD+N measures between 0.18%-0.29%, far from the modern transparent level of 0.01% or below. The S/N ratio of 90.1dB A-weighted fails to reach the 105dB+ standard, deteriorating to -66dBV when including high-frequency noise. Frequency response claims 20Hz-20kHz but shows good characteristics only at a 4Ω load, with increased distortion at an 8Ω load. These measurement results fall significantly short of modern digital amplifier technology standards and are far from transparent sound reproduction.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The products are nothing more than combinations of basic Class-D designs with no proprietary technology. The LP-2020A uses a Yamaha IC with altered markings instead of the claimed Tripath TA2020, raising concerns about technical specification transparency. The power supply circuits, output stages, and filtering all use minimal configurations with no technical advantages compared to competitors using modern high-performance chips like the TI TPA3255. The design lacks originality, focusing purely on low-cost manufacturing through off-the-shelf component combinations. Component procurement reportedly depends on "whatever parts were available that week," showing no consistent design philosophy.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The Lepy LP-2024A+ (20 USD) is positioned in the world's lowest price tier for a product offering basic stereo amplifier functions. Although its measured performance and quality are extremely low, no alternative with equivalent or better basic functions can be found on the current market at a lower price. Based on the review policy, the cost-performance is rated 1.0 because no cheaper alternative is available for comparison. It is important to note that this score reflects pure price competitiveness only and does not represent overall value when considering performance and reliability.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The company has serious quality control problems. Power circuit failures are frequently reported, with the included power adapters commonly rated as "garbage level." Large unit-to-unit variations exist, with reports of "using used components" and "quality changing depending on that week's parts procurement." Clear information about the warranty period and after-sales support is limited, with a dealer-based response being standard. The repair infrastructure is unclear, and the products are positioned as disposable, with replacement rather than repair expected due to their low price. The reliability level is significantly below the industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The pursuit of extreme low cost forms the core of the design philosophy, but this approach is irrational considering modern technological progress. Price competition that sacrifices quality and performance is an outdated strategy, as higher-performance products have now emerged in the same price range. Investment in basic sound quality improvement elements such as enhancing measured performance, improving quality control, and proper power supply design is neglected. It is irrational to stick with old-generation designs when modern high-performance chips like the TI TPA3255 enable significantly higher performance at similar costs. Even as a cost leadership strategy, it is half-hearted with an insufficient response to technological innovation.

## Advice

Purchasing a Lepy product is not recommended unless the budget is extremely constrained. While the pricing is indeed at the lowest level, the measured performance, quality control, and reliability all fall significantly short of modern standards. By expanding the budget to around 50 USD, you can obtain dramatically superior performance and quality from newer Chinese amplifier manufacturers. For example, the Fosi Audio V3 (around 100 USD) has a larger price gap but offers overwhelmingly higher return on investment when considering long-term use. Lepy's power adapters are of poor quality with a high risk of failure, so the cost of a replacement power supply must also be considered. If you are absolutely constrained to a budget under 20 USD, it is strongly recommended to consider used products from domestic manufacturers or discontinued models. Modern technological progress makes it possible to achieve dramatically higher sound quality and reliability with only a minimal additional investment.
