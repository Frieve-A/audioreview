## Overview

CH Precision is an audio manufacturer based in Préverenges, Switzerland. Founded by Cossy and Heeb, it previously designed OEM products like Anagram's DSP DAC modules. Featuring fully discrete, fully differential transistor circuits, it offers the 1 Series and 10 Series. Main products include the C1.2 DAC (about 43,000 USD), M1.1 power amplifier (about 54,000 USD), and C10 DAC.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

CH Precision products achieve transparent levels in some measurements but have issues. Stereophile measurements of the L1 preamplifier show THD+N of 0.00014% (-117dB), S/N ratio of 105.3dB, and channel separation of 140dB, which is excellent. However, the C1.2 DAC's PCM1704 R-2R ladder exhibits linearity errors increasing below -80dBFS, and IMD may exceed 0.02%, not fully meeting transparent levels. Overall, improvements in audible range are limited, inferior to latest digital DACs.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Technology level slightly exceeds industry average. Fully discrete differential circuits and shunt power supplies (115-120dB rejection) achieve low distortion, but the R-2R-based C10 DAC (16 units in dual differential topology) lacks advancement compared to latest delta-sigma DACs. Modular design and precision machining are notable, but overall innovation is limited.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Cost-performance is rated extremely low. As a company review, representative products C1.2 DAC (43,000 USD) and M1.1 power amplifier (54,000 USD) are compared, using weighted average. For C1.2, Topping E70 DAC (349 USD) with equivalent or better measurements (THD 0.0003%, S/N 120dB+) gives 349 USD ÷ 43,000 USD ≈ 0.008. For M1.1, Benchmark AHB2 (3,499 USD, THD 0.0001%) gives 3,499 USD ÷ 54,000 USD ≈ 0.065. Selection reason: both are flagship products with equivalent function and measurements. Average (0.008 + 0.065)/2 ≈ 0.036, thus 0.0. Many low-cost options with matching function and performance exist, making pure performance-to-price ratio unreasonable.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Reliability is at industry average. Swiss quality control and modular design ease repairs, but as a relatively new company, specific failure rate and MTBF data are lacking. Warranty periods are presumed standard, but detailed disclosure is insufficient, with limited long-term track record.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Design philosophy is partially rational but overall limited. Measurement-focused approach is evaluable, but R-2R DAC adoption causes linearity issues, and the necessity of high-cost dedicated equipment is questionable. With general-purpose setups like PC+DAC achieving equivalent performance cheaply, excessive resource input does not contribute to scientific improvements.

## Advice

CH Precision products show some excellent measurements but have linearity issues and extremely low cost-performance. Against the 43,000 USD C1.2, the 349 USD Topping E70 provides equivalent or superior performance, among many rational alternatives. Buyers should carefully consider the significance of paying high for brand value. For pure sound quality pursuit, low-cost transparent-level products are recommended. It may be an option only if price is disregarded.
