summary: "Classic AC-series tone with intentionally colored tube designs; modest modern tech adoption (Nutube/modeling). Cross-class CP is poor to average when compared to the market’s cheapest non-inferior options."

## Overview

Vox is a British amplifier brand founded in 1957 in Dartford, best known for the AC15 (1958) and AC30 (1959). Since 1992 the brand has been owned and distributed by Korg. Current lines span traditional cathode-biased tube combos (AC series) and modern offerings such as the Nutube-equipped Cambridge50 and compact solutions. [1][5]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

From a fidelity standpoint (FR linearity, THD/IMD, S/N, damping), classic Vox tube combos are **not** transparent by design. The AC30 topology is widely documented for “class-A” misconceptions and associated choices (e.g., lack of global negative feedback, hot EL84 operation) that increase distortion versus modern hi-fi baselines. These produce the signature “Vox” breakup but deviate from transparent reproduction. Comprehensive recent third-party bench data (full FR/THD/SNR vs. level/loading) remain limited. [3]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Vox adopts contemporary tech (Nutube, modeling, USB audio) alongside legacy tube circuits. Cambridge50 combines a 50 W class-D power section, 12" driver, modeling, and USB I/O—practical, user-oriented features, though not class-leading versus today’s best modeling ecosystems. [5]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

**Policy-compliant, cross-class comparison (company-level):** We select **multiple representative Vox products** and compute their CP against the **cheapest equivalent-or-better** products we could verify, then take a simple average (importance share data not public).

1) **AC15C1** (15 W 1×12 tube combo) — street **1,049.99 USD**. Comparator: **Fender Champion 50XL** (50 W 1×12 solid-state/modeling) **279.99 USD** (equal-or-better user functions; higher clean headroom; solid-state designs generally achieve lower THD/flatter FR than cathode-biased, no-NFB tube circuits).  
   **CP = 279.99 ÷ 1,049.99 = 0.266… → 0.3**. [2][6]

2) **Cambridge50** (50 W 1×12 modeling, Nutube pre) — street **399.99 USD**. Comparator: **Fender Champion 50XL** **279.99 USD** (equal power/1×12, onboard effects, comparable/greater versatility; no indication of worse measured linearity).  
   **CP = 279.99 ÷ 399.99 = 0.700 → 0.7**. [4][6]

**Company CP (simple average of the above): (0.3 + 0.7) ÷ 2 = 0.5.**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Warranty terms vary by region: Vox UK lists a 2-year standard (3-year via direct purchase). Tube combos carry typical maintenance burden (heat, tube wear). Failure-rate/MTBF data are not disclosed; support is largely dealer-based with Korg’s global network. Net: slightly below average. [7]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Persisting with no-feedback, hot-bias tube designs prioritizes euphonic distortion over measured transparency; measured-performance progression is limited relative to modern modeling/solid-state approaches that deliver lower distortion, higher S/N, and lower costs. Innovation exists (Nutube/modeling), but the mainline direction remains musically valid yet scientifically suboptimal. [3][5]

## Advice

If you specifically want **AC-style breakup/chime**, Vox delivers that character. For **value/versatility**, cross-shop modern modeling combos (e.g., Boss Katana 50 Gen 3) that provide broader sounds, USB recording, and likely superior objective linearity at a fraction of AC-series prices. Confirm I/O (phones/USB/line/IR) against your needs. [8]
