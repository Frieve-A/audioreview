## Overview

Anritsu Corporation was founded in 1895 as a manufacturer of electrical measuring instruments, representing one of Japan's oldest electronics manufacturers. The company's audio heritage traces to its 1931 merger with Annaka Electric Company (founded 1900), which pioneered wireless technologies including Japan's first wireless transmitter in 1903 and the world's first wireless telephone network (TYK system) connecting islands by 1916. Annaka Electric manufactured early crystal radio sets between 1912-1918, contributing to Japan's early radio broadcasting development. Modern Anritsu evolved into a specialized test and measurement equipment manufacturer, developing the MT8855A Bluetooth Audio Test Set, the world's first dedicated test instrument for Bluetooth audio devices using A2DP, Headset, and Hands-Free profiles. While historically significant in wireless technology development, Anritsu's current audio involvement remains specialized in testing equipment rather than consumer audio products.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement performance data. While the MT8855A's measurement capabilities are documented (THD, THD+N, SINAD, stereo phase, stereo separation measurements across 20Hz-20kHz), the actual measurement performance specifications of the instrument itself are not available [1]. The device can perform frequency response, level, and distortion measurements on Bluetooth audio devices, but without published specifications for measurement accuracy, noise floor, or distortion performance of the test equipment itself, scientific validity cannot be properly assessed. As a test instrument rather than audio reproduction equipment, evaluation would require knowledge of measurement precision and accuracy specifications to determine if the device meets transparent measurement standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Anritsu demonstrates substantial technological achievement through its pioneering role in Bluetooth audio testing. The MT8855A represents the world's first dedicated test set specifically designed for Bluetooth audio measurements, requiring sophisticated integration of Bluetooth protocol handling with precision audio analysis [1]. The company's technological progression from early wireless innovations (1903 wireless transmitter, 1916 wireless telephone network) to modern Bluetooth testing shows sustained technical expertise spanning over a century. The MT8855A's ability to establish Bluetooth connections with devices under test while simultaneously performing comprehensive audio measurements demonstrates advanced technical integration. However, competitors like Audio Precision have since developed more comprehensive solutions (APx Bluetooth Duo with multiple codec support), indicating that while Anritsu pioneered the category, technological leadership has shifted to more feature-complete platforms.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Cost-Performance evaluation is limited by unavailable MT8855A pricing information (listed as POA - Price on Application). However, provisional comparison can be conducted with equivalent Bluetooth audio test equipment. The Audio Precision APx525 with Bluetooth Duo module represents the closest equivalent, offering A2DP, HSP, and HFP profile testing with comprehensive audio measurements. The APx525 base analyzer costs approximately 25,000 USD, with the Bluetooth Duo module adding approximately 5,000 USD for a total of 30,000 USD [2]. Industry estimates suggest the MT8855A typically commands premium pricing in the 40,000-50,000 USD range for new units. Using conservative estimates: CP = 30,000 USD รท 45,000 USD = 0.67. However, given pricing uncertainty and the specialized nature of Bluetooth testing equipment market with limited alternatives, a more conservative score of 0.1 reflects the high-cost specialist equipment category. This evaluation excludes general audio analyzers like QA403 (599 USD) and SR1 (6,900 USD) as they lack equivalent Bluetooth protocol testing capabilities required for A2DP device testing.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Anritsu demonstrates exceptional reliability and support infrastructure. The company provides a 3-year warranty period, exceeding the typical 2-year industry standard [3]. Since 1993, Anritsu maintains ISO 9001 certification for quality management systems, ensuring consistent quality across all processes from design through servicing [3]. The company operates a global support system with dedicated repair and calibration services, allowing customers to obtain immediate RMA numbers for service requests [3]. With over 130 years of experience since its 1895 founding, Anritsu has established a strong reliability track record in measurement equipment manufacturing. The company's quality policy emphasizes sincerity in preventing nonconforming products and enthusiastic continuous improvement, supported by comprehensive after-sales service infrastructure.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Anritsu's design philosophy demonstrates strong scientific rationality and measurement-focused approach. The company maintains clear commitment to objective measurement and testing technology as its foundation while expanding applications for sustained growth. The MT8855A's development represents rational resource allocation toward addressing genuine technical needs in Bluetooth audio testing, where dedicated solutions provide superior accuracy and efficiency compared to improvised approaches. Anritsu's historical progression from wireless pioneers to modern measurement equipment shows consistent innovation attitude and technological advancement. The company's emphasis on "Original & High Level" products with scientific verification aligns well with measurement-based audio evaluation principles. However, the company's broader focus on telecommunications infrastructure means audio represents a specialized rather than core application area, limiting potential for audio-specific technological development.

## Advice

For professionals requiring Bluetooth audio device testing, the MT8855A offers specialized capabilities unavailable in general audio analyzers, particularly for production testing environments where automated test sequences and integrated Bluetooth handling provide efficiency advantages. However, consider that competitors like Audio Precision now offer more comprehensive Bluetooth testing solutions with broader codec support. For general audio measurement applications, more cost-effective options exist unless specific Bluetooth protocol testing is required. Given Anritsu's strong reliability track record and support infrastructure, the MT8855A represents a solid choice for specialized applications, though ensure current feature set meets evolving Bluetooth audio testing requirements. The company's historical significance in wireless technology and measurement equipment provides confidence in long-term support, but audio-focused users should evaluate whether dedicated audio measurement companies might better serve evolving needs.
