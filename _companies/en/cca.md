## Overview

CCA (Clear Concept Audio) is a Chinese budget IEM specialist manufacturer established in 2018. As a sister company of Knowledge Zenith (KZ), it has become a major player in the ChiFi boom by offering multi-driver IEMs in the ultra-low price range of 15-50 USD. With diverse models like CRA, C10, C12, and Rhapsody, the company has penetrated the market with multi-driver configurations and relatively good tuning despite low prices.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

CCA's measurement performance remains at a level appropriate for its budget price range. Even the latest model Rhapsody claims THD below 0.5%, which significantly exceeds the transparency level of 0.01%. The C12's actual measurements record THD 0.125% (1kHz, 95dB SPL), barely exceeding the problematic level of 0.1%. While specific measurement data for frequency response is limited, general adjustments within ±3dB range have been reported. There are no reports of achieving transparency levels for S/N ratio or crosstalk, placing them clearly at a disadvantage in side-by-side comparisons with the latest digital technology.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

CCA's technology level is around industry average. The design capability to achieve multi-driver configurations (5BA+1DD in C12, 4BA+1DD in C10) at low prices is commendable, but it fundamentally relies on combinations of existing technologies. Some technical ingenuity is evident, such as dual magnet design (magnetic field strength 1 Tesla) and adoption of improved versions of BA30095 units, but proprietary innovative technology development is limited. The focus is placed on design optimization for low-cost realization rather than technology investment directly contributing to measurement performance improvement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

CCA's cost-performance is extremely excellent. The flagship product CRA (18 USD) compared to equivalent function and measurement performance Moondrop Chu (20 USD) results in 20 USD ÷ 18 USD = 1.11, but clamped at 1.0, achieving world-class cheapest evaluation of 1.0. Even at the C10 (41 USD) level, searching for equivalent performance products often results in significantly higher prices, maintaining world-class cheapest positioning for multi-driver configuration IEMs. China's manufacturing industry vertical integration and cost optimization enable price settings that are difficult for other companies to achieve.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

CCA's reliability and support are around industry average. While providing 1-year IEM body warranty and 3-month cable warranty, customer service receives mixed evaluations. Regarding quality control, defective product contamination has been reported in past models like ZS3 and ZSN, with certain quality variations pointed out alongside sister company KZ. The warranty process requires customers to bear shipping costs to the manufacturer, and considering international shipping, the practical hurdle for warranty utilization becomes somewhat high.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

CCA's design philosophy meets functions expected from general audio products but lacks progressiveness. Multi-driver realization at low prices is rational, but technology investment toward achieving transparency levels in measurement result standards is limited. While avoiding non-scientific claims, it essentially remains in following existing approaches, with no breakthrough improvements in measurement performance or innovative approaches observed. The design philosophy is specialized for low-price competition in the ChiFi market, positioning conservatively from the perspective of pursuing high-fidelity acoustic reproduction.

## Advice

CCA is a suitable choice for beginners wanting to experience multi-driver IEMs at ultra-low prices. Particularly, the CRA (18 USD) provides overwhelming cost-performance in its price range. However, if prioritizing achievement of transparency levels in measurement performance, considering higher-priced products is recommended. Considering quality variation risks, thorough initial defect checks and purchases from reliable dealers are essential. For long-term use or serious acoustic pursuit purposes, considering options with superior technology levels and measurement performance is advisable.
