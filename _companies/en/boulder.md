## Overview

Boulder Amplifiers was founded in 1984 in Louisville, Colorado, and is a US audio manufacturer. It primarily produces power amplifiers and is a vertically integrated company that manufactures components in-house. Products emphasize measurement performance, with the 2150 monoblock achieving 1000W output, THD 0.00036%, and SNR 97dB A-weighted, but inferior in SNR and others compared to latest Class D amplifiers. The 1100 series shows similar trends.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Boulder's measurement performance is at an intermediate level. The 2150 shows THD 0.00036% (4Ω, 400W), flat frequency response within 20Hz-20kHz, and output impedance of 0.02Ω, excellent in some areas, but SNR 97dB A-weighted falls below the transparent threshold of 105dB, placing it in the intermediate range. These values are confirmed by Stereophile measurements, providing effective audible distortion reduction, but inferior to latest Class D (Purifi 1ET9040BA, SNR 140dB, THD <0.0002%). Distortion control at high output offers improvement, but overall average evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Boulder's technology level is above industry average but not the highest. The 2150 incorporates multiple bipolar transistors and Smart Current Biasing for distortion reduction, but lacks uniqueness and is inferior to the advanced self-oscillating control and efficiency of latest Class D modules (Purifi Eigentakt). Vertical integration for component development exists, but innovation is low, with limited measurement improvements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Boulder products have extremely low cost-performance. Performance equivalent to the 2150 (130000 USD/pair) can be achieved with Apollon Audio Purifi 1ET6525SA (about 2000 USD, THD 0.0002%, SNR >130dB, 650W×2). Calculation: 2000 USD ÷ 130000 USD = 0.015, rounding to 0.0. Similarly, for the 1150 (about 47000 USD), CP = 2000/47000 = 0.043, also 0.0. For transparent-level achievement, Crown XLS 2502 (600 USD, THD <0.5%, 775W×2) suffices, but a price difference over 65 times in a domain with no scientific sound quality difference cannot be justified.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Reliability backed by 40 years of history and US manufacturing is high. Heavy-duty chassis and precision machining ensure mechanical durability, with low parts supply risks from vertical integration. Adopted in pro markets, long-term support is expected. Warranty exceeds industry standards, but complexity and weight increase repair costs and difficulty. No major failure complaints confirmed in 2025, placing reliability at upper industry levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The philosophy emphasizing measurement performance is partial, but Class A/AB operation and massive transistor use are inefficient and irrational. Pursuing neutrality and transparency is correct, but excessive pursuit beyond audible transparency lacks meaning and economic rationality. With equivalent performance achievable at low cost via latest Class D chips, the necessity of dedicated design is absent, with irrational aspects dominant.

## Advice

Boulder products are not recommended except for specific high-output needs. Scientifically, equivalent transparency is achievable with Apollon Purifi (2000 USD), with no audible difference. A 130000 USD budget yields greater improvements via speakers or room treatments. Value is limited to measurement records; for music enjoyment, alternatives are strongly recommended.
