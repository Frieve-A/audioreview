summary: "Japanese speaker maker advocating a time-domain theory. The Yoshii9 line presents a clear concept, but the lack of independent measurements and weak price justification keep the overall score low."

## Overview

TimeDomain Corporation began as an audio lab within ASCII Research Institute in November 1996 and became independent in September 1997. It promotes a proprietary “time-domain theory” and sells amplified speaker systems such as the cylindrical Yoshii9 series [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

We find no credible third-party anechoic measurements (frequency response, THD, dynamic range, etc.). Manufacturer specs for Yoshii9 MK2 include an 8 cm full-range driver and a bundled amplifier rated at 12 W + 12 W with mini/RCA inputs—catalog values rather than independent tests [2]. While the firm emphasizes group-delay flatness in its theory documents, objective demonstrations of audible superiority are not provided [6].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The system architecture—single full-range drivers in a resonance-controlled cylindrical enclosure with a dedicated amplifier—shows a consistent design intent. However, without CTA-2034-class third-party data or peer-reviewed validation, the achieved performance relative to modern studio monitors remains unclear [2][6].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

We use the currently available **Yoshii9 MK2 (speaker + amplifier)** as TimeDomain's representative product. Its market price is **about 2,230 USD** (converted from 2200 USD at the official rate on 2025-08-19) [2]. As the cheapest equal-or-better comparator with published measurements, we select **JBL 305P MkII (pair)**—amplified, with balanced inputs and full CTA-2034 data [3]; Sweetwater pair price is **318 USD** [4].

- **Equivalence note (short)**: Amplified speakers with analog inputs; objective data (spinorama and specs) indicate at least comparable transparency on common metrics [3][4].

**CP calculation (single representative product):**  
CP = Cheapest equivalent price ÷ Representative product price = **318 USD ÷ 2,230 USD = 0.14 → 0.1** (rounded, clamped at 1.0) [2][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A domestic sales channel documents continuing repair availability, which supports long-term usability [5]. However, internationally published reliability statistics are scarce. We therefore assign a midpoint score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Prioritizing time-domain behavior (e.g., group delay) is a reasonable focus, but the company has not disclosed **how much** improvement is achieved on measurable axes. With numerous monitors offering transparent, well-documented performance at far lower prices, price-to-rationality alignment is weak [3][6].

## Advice

If you value measurement-backed transparency and value, start with active studio monitors that publish CTA-2034 data (e.g., JBL 305P MkII) [3][4]. If you are drawn to Yoshii9 MK2’s aesthetics or concept, proceed only after careful in-room audition and verifying return terms, acknowledging the absence of independent measurements. Should robust third-party data be released, reassessment would be warranted.
