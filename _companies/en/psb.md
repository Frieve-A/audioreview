summary: "A veteran speaker manufacturer founded in Canada in 1972. Through founder Paul Barton's design philosophy and cooperation with the National Research Council (NRC), they have built a reputation for acoustic design based on scientific evidence. The overwhelming cost-performance of the Alpha P5 is noteworthy, but compared to other companies, there are areas where they fall behind in technological innovation and brand power. While their development stance in close cooperation with Canadian acoustic research institutions is commendable, their overall competitiveness can be said to be moderate."

## Overview

PSB is a speaker manufacturer founded in 1972 by Paul Barton in Canada. The company name derives from the names of founder Paul Barton and his wife Sue Barton. The company's greatest characteristic lies in conducting acoustic tuning of all products in the anechoic chamber of Canada's National Research Council (NRC). This achieves a scientific approach based on psychoacoustics rather than subjective sound creation.

Currently operating as part of the Lenbrook Group, in 2024 the Alpha iQ received the "Best Wireless Bookshelf Speaker Award" from EISA (European Imaging and Sound Association), continuing steady growth as a company with over 50 years of history. Under the brand concept "True to Nature," they pursue natural sound reproduction.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

PSB's greatest strength lies in their long-term cooperative relationship with Canada's NRC. Through joint research with the world-renowned psychoacoustician Dr. Floyd Toole, they have established a development methodology that emphasizes both measurement data and double-blind listening tests. This is a rare scientific approach in the industry. However, published measurement data is limited, and the reality is that many products lack clear detailed values for THD+N and frequency characteristics. The Alpha iQ's frequency response is published as 64Hz-20kHz (±3dB), but this is not a particularly excellent figure.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design know-how from over 50 years of history and the unique development environment of acoustic tuning in NRC's anechoic chamber certainly contribute to technological improvement. Particularly in the Alpha iQ, they actively incorporate modern functions such as built-in dedicated amplifiers of 180W RMS (60W each woofer, 30W each tweeter) and DSP crossover, BluOS integration, and initiatives in UWB (Ultra Wide Band) technology. However, innovative elements like KEF's Metamaterial technology are not seen in driver technology or cabinet design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Alpha P5 (USD 349) has clear price advantages compared to the Q Acoustics 3020i (USD 449) and ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 (USD 480-930). CP = USD 349 ÷ USD 449 = 0.78, and the advantage increases further when compared to higher-end models. The Alpha iQ streaming speaker (USD 999-1,499) also has competitive pricing compared to the KEF LS50 Wireless (USD 1,599 and above). However, price advantages are limited when compared to Chinese manufacturers' products with equivalent performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

They have a track record of over 50 years of business continuity and a stable management foundation as part of the Lenbrook Group. In the North American market, they have appropriate support systems in place with relatively good parts supply. However, regarding official distributor systems and repair support in the Japanese market, there are areas inferior to other major manufacturers. Regarding product durability, no particular problematic reports are seen, but there are voices pointing out quality variations due to Chinese manufacturing.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The scientific approach through cooperation with NRC is highly commendable, but on the other hand, the scientific basis for proprietary technologies like "RoomFeel Technology" is unclear. This technology claims to "reproduce ideal room setup," but specific mechanisms and measurement data are not published. Additionally, the brand concept "True to Nature" is abstract, and it's unclear what standard of "naturalness" it refers to. As a company advocating scientific approaches, more concrete and verifiable claims are desired.

## Advice

PSB is suitable for users seeking "scientifically-based sound creation at reasonable prices." Particularly, the Alpha P5 can be strongly recommended for beginners to intermediate users seeking high-quality sound on a limited budget.

- **Budget-conscious audio beginners**: The Alpha P5 (USD 349) is one of the most complete choices in its price range. It provides sound quality comparable to higher-end models from KEF and ELAC.
- **Streaming-focused users**: The Alpha iQ (USD 999-1,499) has price advantages compared to the KEF LS50 Wireless and offers high convenience through BluOS integration.
- **Measurement data-focused users**: While there is the background of NRC tuning, since published measurement data is limited, if seeking more detailed specifications, we recommend also considering other manufacturers' products.

Before purchase, it's important to audition as much as possible and confirm that it matches your sound preferences.
