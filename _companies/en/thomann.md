## Overview

Thomann is Europe's largest musical instrument and audio equipment retailer, founded in 1954 in Bavaria, Germany. Hans Thomann Jr. launched online sales in 1996, and the company now handles over 110,000 products. They also develop their own brand "Harley Benton," offering low-cost equipment manufactured in China. As a pioneer in e-commerce, they have grown into a global enterprise with overseas sales accounting for 65% of revenue.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Harley Benton brand audio interface MP-500 supports 192kHz/24bit with THD -93dB (0.002%) and dynamic range of 108dB, clearing the transparent level standards (THD 0.01% or below, dynamic range 105dB or above). The GPA-400 power amplifier's THD below 0.15% and S/N ratio above 90dB approaches problem level, while the HB-20R Combo's THD 0.5% and S/N ratio 75dB is completely at problem level. The MP-500's performance is comparable to the latest digital technology and achieves audibly meaningful quality, but amplifier products have room for improvement.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Harley Benton relies primarily on Chinese OEM manufacturing, with no confirmed proprietary design, technical papers, or patents. While basic technologies like the MP-500's 192kHz support and FRFR-112A's 1200W Class D amplifier are incorporated, these are combinations of off-the-shelf designs. Measurement performance falls below industry average, with no visible technical originality or advancement. The design philosophy prioritizes cost reduction and is far from industry-leading proprietary design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

In price comparison for equivalent function and performance, Harley Benton reaches world-cheapest levels. The MP-500 (198 EUR, approximately 26,400 JPY) is a product combining a 192kHz/24bit audio interface with 8 programmable MIDI foot switches. No competing product with equivalent functionality exists, and the closest competitor MeloAudio Tone Shifter Mega has been discontinued. Since no single product with equivalent or superior function and performance can be found in the current market, the MP-500 becomes effectively the world's cheapest option.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Thomann's support system as a retailer exceeds industry standards. Customers evaluate it as having "the fastest and simplest ordering process" and "excellent customer service." They achieve rapid delivery within Germany and provide support leveraging specialized knowledge from many employees who are musicians. However, long-term reliability data for Harley Benton products themselves is limited, with dependence on Chinese manufacturing quality.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Thomann's strategy has rationality in terms of "improving accessibility through low prices." Their stance of differentiating against Amazon through specialized knowledge and service is commendable. Harley Benton's technology development direction also shows improvement, with the MP-500 achieving transparent level standards (THD -93dB, dynamic range 108dB). However, amplifier products (such as HB-20R Combo) still retain problem-level indicators like THD 0.5% and S/N ratio 75dB, making quality improvement across all products a challenge. Utilization of the latest digital technology is progressing partially.

## Advice

Thomann is excellent as a retailer, and the Harley Benton brand shows significant quality variation by product. High-performance products like the MP-500 achieve transparent-level measurement results and are currently the world's cheapest option for a combination of 192kHz audio interface and MIDI foot controller. However, amplifier products still show problem-level measurement values, requiring careful product selection. When considering purchase, we recommend confirming specific measurement data and making judgments by product category. Thomann's support system as a retailer is reliable, and technical quality achieves high standards depending on the product.
