## Overview

BQEYZ is an audio brand established in 2017 in Dongguan, China, with the official company name Dongguan Xianchao Acoustic Technology Co., Ltd. The acronym stands for "Best Quality Earphones for Your Z(G)eneration" and specializes primarily in in-ear monitors (IEMs). The company's distinctive feature is its specialization in tribrid configurations combining dynamic drivers, balanced armatures, and piezoelectric drivers. Their product lineup includes seasonal series like Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, as well as budget models such as BQ-10 and Frost.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Based on measurement data from its flagship product, the Spring 2, the frequency response exhibits a distinct V-shape with a bloated mid-bass and peaks in the high frequencies, deviating from the ±3dB range indicative of high fidelity. The specifications of 110dB sensitivity and 32Ω impedance are standard. However, reports indicate an increase in total harmonic distortion (THD), particularly in the low frequencies, which poses a challenge to achieving transparency. Available measurement data shows limited detailed numerical information for S/N ratio, making evaluation based on these critical indicators difficult. While the high-frequency extension from the piezoelectric driver is confirmed, it does not necessarily translate to an overall improvement in fidelity. Based on available measurement data, the performance is judged not to have reached a scientifically transparent level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

BQEYZ's most significant technological feature is the tribrid configuration using 5-layer to 9-layer piezoelectric ceramic drivers. The application of piezoelectric elements to IEMs is uncommon, demonstrating industry uniqueness. In-house manufacturing quality control and optimization technology for each driver unit are worthy of evaluation. Particularly, the Spring 2's 9-layer piezoelectric driver achieves high-frequency characteristics difficult for conventional BA drivers. However, this technological innovation has not translated into measurement results significantly exceeding other manufacturers' products, suggesting untapped potential in technical capabilities. Design by technical staff with 20 years of manufacturing experience exceeds industry average standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

For BQEYZ's representative product, the Spring 2 (170 USD), we selected the 7Hz Salnotes Zero (20 USD) and the Truthear x Crinacle ZERO:RED (55 USD) as comparison targets with equivalent or superior measurement performance. As this is a company review, we calculate the average value from multiple alternatives. The 7Hz Salnotes Zero is calculated as 20 USD ÷ 170 USD ≈ 0.12, which rounds to 0.1. The Truthear x Crinacle ZERO:RED is 55 USD ÷ 170 USD ≈ 0.32, which rounds to 0.3. The simple average of these, (0.1 + 0.3) ÷ 2 = 0.2, is the final evaluation score. Even for the budget model BQ-10 (30 USD), numerous alternatives with superior measurement performance exist at similar price points. While piezoelectric drivers offer technical differentiation, price competitiveness remains low considering the audio quality effects users actually obtain.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

BQEYZ provides a standard 1-year warranty for IEM products and a 3-month warranty for cables. Purchases through authorized dealers include 30-day return support. However, user reviews report initial defects and quality degradation during long-term use. Particularly noted are fitting difficulties and cable-related noise issues. As an emerging company established in 2017, long-term reliability data for products is insufficient. Meanwhile, quality control systems through in-house manufacturing are established, maintaining industry-average support standards. Information about repair systems and firmware update support is limited, with improvements expected in the future.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

BQEYZ's tribrid design centered on piezoelectric drivers represents a rational approach utilizing each driver's characteristics. The concept of supplementing high-frequency characteristics difficult for conventional BA drivers with piezoelectric elements is scientifically sound. In-house manufacturing optimization of each driver is also a rational direction. However, actual products still exhibit V-shaped tuning and tonal issues, indicating technical potential is not fully utilized for sound quality improvement. Additionally, with numerous products achieving equivalent performance at lower prices, the necessity for specialized equipment existence is diminishing. While scientific approaches are recognized, final results have not achieved transparency-level sound quality.

## Advice

BQEYZ is commendable for technological innovation, but currently faces significant challenges in price competitiveness. Those considering high-priced models like the Spring 2 are strongly recommended to first compare with products offering equivalent or superior measurement performance at lower prices, such as the Truthear x Crinacle ZERO:RED or Sennheiser IE 300. BQEYZ products are positioned as enthusiast choices for those who value the technical characteristics of piezoelectric drivers. For budget-conscious buyers, alternatives like the 7Hz Salnotes Zero or Moondrop Chu 2 offer similar performance at less than 1/8 the price. While anticipating the company's future technological development and pricing improvements, current product selection requires careful cost-effectiveness consideration. Before purchasing, always conduct listening tests to confirm whether piezoelectric driver tonal characteristics match personal preferences.
