## Overview

Schiit Audio is an audio equipment manufacturer founded in California, USA in 2010. Founders Jason Stoddard and Mike Moffat aimed to provide high-quality audio equipment at affordable prices, focusing on DACs, headphone amplifiers, and power amplifiers as their main products. The company develops proprietary technologies including fully discrete circuits, Mesh digital filters, Continuity A output stages, and Forkbeard control systems, while maintaining transparency through published measurement data. Current flagship products include Modi+ (129USD), Magni+ (109USD), Bifrost (799USD), and Yggdrasil (2,299USD), with a direct sales model eliminating middleman markups.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The company's measurement performance is generally good, with many products clearing transparency-level standards. The Magni+ headphone amplifier achieves THD+N <0.0007% (high gain) and SNR >110dB (high gain), while the Ragnarok 2 integrated amplifier records THD <0.01% and SNR >115dB. The Modi+ DAC implements the ESS ES9018 DAC chip with 24bit/192kHz support. While the company provides basic measurement data, it does not offer comprehensive datasheets like some competitors. These measurement results achieve levels that realize transparent sound reproduction for human hearing, providing scientifically valid sound quality improvement effects. However, some products don't quite reach the highest standards when compared with certain competing products.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Schiit Audio possesses above-average technical capabilities in discrete analog circuit design. Their proprietary Schiit Mesh digital filter combines time-domain and frequency-domain optimization, working with conventional delta-sigma modulators to improve sound quality. The active implementation of self-developed technologies like the Continuity A output stage technology and Forkbeard digital control system is commendable. They properly implement standard DAC chips like the ESS9028 and AK4493S. However, these technologies don't reach industry-leading levels, remaining at mid-tier manufacturer technical standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Comparing the company's representative products against the cheapest products with equivalent or superior function and performance. For the Modi+ (129USD), the Topping DX1 (99USD) can be cited as competition. The DX1 achieves excellent measurement performance of THD+N <0.0002% and SNR 120dB at 99USD. For the Magni+ (109USD), the same DX1 provides excellent performance with 280mW@32Ω output and THD+N <0.0003%@200mW/32Ω. Calculation: Modi+: 99USD ÷ 129USD = 0.77, Magni+: 99USD ÷ 109USD = 0.91, average: (0.77 + 0.91) ÷ 2 = 0.84. Therefore, equivalent function and performance products are available at approximately 84% of the price, placing cost-performance at average levels.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Manufacturing within the United States maintains above industry-average standards for quality control and technical support systems. Company products maintain healthy pricing in the used market, indicating confidence in durability. Warranty periods are industry-standard, but the direct sales system enables rapid customer response. With a track record of over a decade since its founding in 2010, long-term product support can be expected. However, they don't provide particularly superior warranty conditions or innovative support services compared to emerging Chinese manufacturers, limiting evaluation to slightly above industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company's design philosophy is highly rational, based on scientific approaches. Their stance of pursuing objective sound quality improvement through published measurement data, transparent explanations of engineering methods, and elimination of occult claims is commendable. They clearly explain the technical rationale for adopting discrete designs while also taking appropriate approaches including simple op-amp based products where suitable. Cost efficiency through direct sales models, functional expandability through modular design, and firmware update support represent rational design decisions for modern audio equipment. Their technical approach toward achieving transparency-level standards from the measurement criteria table is consistent, with no unscientific sound quality improvement claims observed.

## Advice

Schiit Audio is a reliable American audio manufacturer with good measurement performance and a rational design philosophy. However, the existence of competing products offering equivalent function and performance at approximately 84% of the price places them at a disadvantage in pure cost-performance terms. When considering a purchase, the deciding factor becomes whether you value added benefits such as peace of mind from American manufacturing, brand reliability, design preferences, and expectations for long-term support. For those prioritizing pure measurement performance and cost, Chinese products like the Topping DX1 represent rational choices. However, the company's higher-end models like Bifrost and Yggdrasil offer uniqueness in their price ranges and merit consideration for those seeking technical interest or specific sound characteristics. For beginners, starting with more affordable alternatives is recommended.
