summary: "Japanese cable maker founded in 1952. Uses its in-house 102 SSC (Special Surface Copper) conductors and high-precision processing for power and signal cables, but there is no credible scientific evidence that these products yield audible improvements over properly specified standard cables."

## Overview

Oyaide Electric Co., Ltd. (founded 1952, Japan) manufactures premium audio power cords, interconnects, speaker cables, and connectors. Signature technologies include its **102 SSC (Special Surface Copper)** conductor, diamond-die drawing for smoother surface finish, tight dimensional tolerances, and designs like the C.I.S. (Cross-Insulation Structure) to control capacitance and vibration.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Claims of audible improvements from swapping power cords or digital cables are **not** substantiated by controlled tests. Measurements comparing “audiophile” and generic power cords show amplifier output differences on the order of **0.1–0.2 dB** at ~100 W with distortion components down around **–80 dB**, i.e., at or below audibility in normal use (see References). Oyaide’s published specs—e.g., **Across 3000** conductor resistance **0.63 Ω/100 m**, and **FTVS-510/DB-510** capacitance **56.5 nF/km**—are technically coherent, but they do not imply audible benefits versus standard, compliant cabling.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Oyaide exhibits solid manufacturing: **102 SSC** uses virgin copper, diamond-die drawing, **±1 μm** strand tolerance (versus typical ±8 μm), and dual annealing. Across the lineup, designs target low resistance/capacitance and robust shielding. Examples: **Across 3000** reduces resistance to **0.63 Ω/100 m**; **FTVS-510/DB-510** specifies **56.5 nF/km** capacitance and **21 Ω/km** conductor resistance. These are high-quality implementations typical of premium cables rather than breakthrough innovations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

When compared to the **cheapest functionally equivalent** cords meeting equal or better electrical ratings and safety compliance, Oyaide’s price-to-function ratio is poor. Example: **TUNAMI GPX-R V2 (1.8 m)** sells for **598 USD** at a major US dealer. A **UL-listed 14 AWG, 6-ft, 15 A NEMA 5-15P to IEC C13** cord from a mainstream brand is **10.99 USD**. Similarly, the **VONDITA-X (1.8 m)** is **1,195 USD** at a US dealer while standard 15 A cords remain in the ~10 USD range. Given equivalent function and compliance, the cost delta dominates, hence the low score.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Products are made in Japan with detailed spec sheets and clear electrical ratings (e.g., **125 V/15 A** with **PSE** for Japanese models). Distribution through established dealers adds purchase support. However, **failure-rate statistics (MTBF)** and granular warranty terms are not broadly published, limiting quantitative reliability assessment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Design goals and published metrics (resistance, capacitance, impedance) reflect rational engineering. The tension arises when subjective "voicing" claims are emphasized without reproducible, third-party corroboration. Transparent signal transfer is a valid target; the burden of proof for audible superiority remains unmet.

## Advice

For consumers considering Oyaide products, we recommend focusing on **electrical compliance and safety** rather than claimed audio improvements. Standard, properly rated power cords meeting **UL/CSA/PSE** standards provide equivalent functionality at a fraction of the cost. If premium aesthetics or specific connector requirements justify the expense, that's a valid choice—but don't expect measurable audio benefits.
