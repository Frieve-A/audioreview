## Overview

FM Acoustics is a Swiss high-end audio manufacturer based in Horgen, Switzerland. Founded in 1978, the company established its global reputation through the Resolution Series power amplifiers. The flagship FM 711 series has been in continuous production since 1996, featuring discrete Class A design with high power output. With Swiss precision in component matching and robust construction, FM Acoustics has maintained long-standing support among high-end audio enthusiasts.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

FM Acoustics makes claims such as "complete absence of all forms of distortion" and "100dB removal of interference, hum, and noise," but detailed measurement data from independent testing organizations like Stereophile or Audio Science Review are not publicly available. The evaluation must rely solely on manufacturer specifications, lacking scientific verifiability. Without objective assessment against modern measurement standards, the default value of 0.5 is applied for unknown measurement results. Third-party measurement data disclosure proving transparent-level achievement is required.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Resolution Series employs sophisticated discrete design developed over 30+ years. The design philosophy pursuing analog technology to its limits includes full discrete Class A circuitry, zero feedback design, and custom-designed capacitors. The precision component matching process and 550A peak current supply capability demonstrate significant physical technology investment. However, compared to modern advanced technologies like Hypex NCore or Purifi Eigentakt modules representing the latest Class D technology, the technical approach feels outdated. While acknowledging the scale of technology investment, it doesn't reach industry-leading standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The current price of FM 711-MKIII is approximately 3,818,182 JPY (25,454 USD) in the Japanese market. However, a modern alternative offering equivalent or superior measurement performance exists: Buckeye Amps Purifi 1ET9040BA monoblock pair (339,000 JPY / 2,260 USD). This delivers 375W (8Ω)/750W (4Ω) per channel and is expected to demonstrate measurement performance superior to FM Acoustics. The calculation yields 2,260 USD ÷ 25,454 USD = 0.089, rounded to 0.1. Despite an 11x+ price difference, modern Class D design likely offers superior measured performance, making cost-performance abysmal.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

True to Swiss manufacturing, FM Acoustics is known for robust construction and excellent quality control. The track record of the FM 711 series in continuous production since 1996 demonstrates design maturity and long-term support structure. Manuel Huber's factory maintains rigorous component matching, ensuring manufacturing quality consistency. Failure rates are presumed to be significantly below industry average, with repair support available. However, it lacks the rapid firmware updates and latest feature additions of emerging manufacturers, falling short of industry-leading standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design philosophy emphasizing Class A operation and discrete construction is not necessarily optimal for achieving transparent levels per measurement standards. Modern Class D technologies (Hypex, Purifi) can achieve lower THD+N (below 0.001%), higher SNR (above 120dB), and higher damping factor. The analog circuit mass-investment approach for sound quality improvement has limited scientific effect while significantly increasing manufacturing costs. The mandatory use of dedicated cables (FORCELINES) also raises rationality questions. The direction of maintaining high prices while falling short of modern technology in measured performance cannot be considered rational.

## Advice

While FM Acoustics certainly possesses excellent manufacturing quality and brand value, it becomes difficult to recommend when evaluated by 2025 standards. With equivalent acoustic performance achievable through modern Class D amplifiers from Buckeye Amps or Apollon Audio at one-tenth the cost or less, this cannot be considered a rational purchase decision. Even for those insisting on traditional analog design, we strongly recommend considering competitors like Pass Labs or Boulder that publish measurement data. For purchasers prioritizing scientifically measured performance over brand value or rarity, these products are unsuitable. Instead, modern amplifiers featuring Purifi or Hypex modules offer superior sound quality and vastly better cost-performance.
