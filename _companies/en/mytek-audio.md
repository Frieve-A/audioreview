## Overview

Mytek Audio (officially: Mytek Digital) is an audio equipment manufacturer established in New York in 1992. Initially specializing in professional A/D and D/A converters, it has been used in hundreds of album productions at major record labels including Sony, Universal, and Warner Music. Since 2011, it entered the audiophile DAC market with four product lines—Liberty, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Empire—covering a wide price range. Manufacturing takes place at both the Brooklyn headquarters factory and a new facility in Poland.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Measured data shows excellent results. The Brooklyn DAC+ achieves THD of 0.0006%, significantly exceeding the transparent level (under 0.01%), with S/N ratio of 116dB also clearing the transparent level (105dB or higher). Channel separation records excellent values of 115dB at 1kHz and 95dB at 20kHz. Resolution demonstrates effective performance equivalent to 19-20 bits, with maximum output levels of +22dBu for balanced and +16dBu for unbalanced outputs providing sufficient headroom. The dynamic range of 130dB from the latest ESS Sabre 9038 chipset is also measured to be satisfactory.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Adopts the latest ESS Sabre 9038 DAC chipset and incorporates femtosecond clocks achieving ultra-low jitter of 0.82ps. USB input operates in optimal isochronous asynchronous mode, supporting all sampling rates from 44.1kHz to 384kHz. Leveraging over 30 years of experience in professional audio, studio-level reference clocks and power supply designs are applied to consumer products. However, DAC chips and amplifier circuits are primarily combinations of existing products, with limited proprietary technology from complete in-house design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The Brooklyn DAC+ has a retail price of approximately 329,000 JPY (equivalent to 2,195 USD), but when compared to the Topping D90 III Sabre (approximately 135,000 JPY / 899 USD) with equivalent measured performance, the calculation yields 135,000 ÷ 329,000 = 0.41. For the Manhattan II DAC (899,000 JPY / 5,995 USD), comparison with the RME ADI-2 Pro FS R (approximately 210,000 JPY / 1,400 USD) using the same ESS 9038 chipset yields 210,000 ÷ 899,000 = 0.23. The average cost-performance score is approximately 0.3, representing a price setting of 2-4 times that of products with equivalent functionality and measured performance. Note that Brooklyn DAC+ has limited new product availability as of 2025, being in a transition period to the successor Brooklyn Bridge II.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Has over 30 years of business continuity since its 1992 establishment, with extensive adoption in professional markets. Usage at major labels including Sony, Universal, and Warner Music serves as evidence of reliability. The 2021 product line renewal strengthened the manufacturing system, with stable quality control structures. Warranty periods and after-sales support meet industry standard levels, though no particularly outstanding advantages are observed. As it is not a startup manufacturer, there is confidence for long-term use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The neutral reference design philosophy of "reproducing recorded signals as accurately as possible" is scientifically rational. The approach emphasizing transparent reproduction based on measured data rather than subjective sound tuning, stemming from its professional audio background, is commendable. Adoption of latest DAC chipsets and low-jitter clocks also represents rational approaches contributing to measured performance improvements. However, questions remain regarding the necessity of existing as dedicated audio equipment. Since the same functionality and performance can be achieved at significantly lower cost with general-purpose equipment (PC + products with equivalent DAC chips), rationality is lacking from a cost-efficiency perspective.

## Advice

Mytek Audio is a manufacturer with excellent measured performance and stable quality, but cannot be recommended from a cost-performance perspective. With products having equivalent measured performance available at half to one-quarter the price, there is no rational reason to pay 2-4 times the price difference for the added value of a professional audio brand. Particularly for the Brooklyn DAC+, new product acquisition has become difficult as of 2025, requiring confirmation of stock availability when considering purchase. It becomes a consideration only when valuing professional studio usage history and build quality, or when specific input/output functions are required. For purely high-quality audio applications, we strongly recommend choosing affordable products using equivalent chipsets such as the Topping D90 III Sabre or RME ADI-2 Pro FS R. For scientific audiophiles who prioritize measured data, we recommend considering alternatives with superior cost-performance.
