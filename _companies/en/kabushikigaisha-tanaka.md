## Overview

Kabushikigaisha-Tanaka (株式会社田中) is a Japanese civil-engineering materials manufacturer established in 1922. In addition to geosynthetics and industrial fiber products, the company offers wooden **sound absorption towers (吸音タワー)** using perforated hinoki frames filled with high-density absorber. The product concept—corner placement and broadband porous absorption with controlled mid/high reflection—is consistent with established room-treatment practices, and it received recognition in the **2023 Wood Design Award** [4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The towers implement standard porous absorption in room corners, where particle velocity is high, so **volume/packing density and placement** align with expected low-frequency attenuation. However, **no third-party standardized measurements** (e.g., reverberation-room or impedance-tube tests) are published for this model, so the quantitative effect remains unverified. As a benchmark for plausibility and scale, a measured corner trap (**GIK Acoustics Tri-Trap**) reports per-unit absorption of **≈6.5 sabins at 50 Hz** and **≈12.3 sabins at 100 Hz** (ASTM C423 “J” mount) [3]. This illustrates the order of magnitude achievable by a large corner trap but cannot be assumed for this product without published data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design uses conventional passive methods (perforated wood frame + high-density fill) and a rational corner-stacking form factor. Materials and build are solid, but no proprietary structures or novel acoustic mechanisms beyond established practice are presented.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Official pricing examples are **¥59,800** (31 × 31 cm, unpainted; ≈**399 USD**) and **¥51,800** (23 × 23 cm, unpainted; ≈**345 USD**) [1]. In the same functional role, a measured baseline **GIK Tri-Trap** lists **starting at 259.99 USD** and publishes third-party lab data (ASTM C423) [2][3]. Given the availability of a measured, similarly scaled alternative at a lower US-market price, cost-performance is moderate for objective acoustic use.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

A century in industrial materials suggests manufacturing continuity. Audio-specific support resources (performance warranties, design services, or lab data) are not documented, so expectations should be moderate compared with specialist acoustic brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Corner-focused porous absorption with a perforated wood facade is consistent with room-treatment fundamentals. The main limitation is **evidence**—publishable third-party measurements would strengthen positioning for critical-listening use.

## Advice

For buyers prioritizing **wood aesthetics, domestic craftsmanship, and corner-stackable form**, the Tanaka towers are a plausible option. For projects requiring **predictable, spec-driven results**, select products with **published third-party measurements** (e.g., GIK Tri-Trap) or request data from the manufacturer; mixing measured corner traps with decorative elements can balance certainty and design goals.
