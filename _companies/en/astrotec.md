## Overview

Astrotec is a Shenzhen-based audio brand. Its parent company was established in 2002, the “Astrotec” brand was created around 2009–2011, and it states it was honored as a “Chinese Top 10 Headphone Brand” for five consecutive years (2017–2021) [1]. The current catalog centers on wired IEMs such as **Vesna** (single DD, LCP diaphragm), **AM850 MK2** (single DD), **Volans** (single DD “Tesla” magnetic system), and **Archimedes** (14.8 mm planar + PZT hybrid) [2][3][4][5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent, lab-style datasets (FR/THD/Isolation) for Astrotec’s recent models are limited as of 2025-09-01. We therefore anchor the score at a neutral mid-point and summarize what can be verified:

- **Manufacturer specs (Vesna):** 6 mm dynamic driver with LCP diaphragm; 30 Ω; 102 dB SPL/mW; stated FR 5 Hz–22 kHz [2].  
- **Manufacturer specs (Archimedes):** 14.8 mm planar magnetic driver (dual-sided 14 magnets, 2 µm diaphragm) + 9-layer PZT; 16 Ω; 106 dB SPL/mW; stated FR 5 Hz–25 kHz [3].  
- **Market context (for comparison only):** widely measured baselines exist for competitors like 7Hz Zero/Zero:2 and LETSHUOER S12 families (IEC-711/5128 databases) [6][7][8]; these inform CP equivalence below but are **not** Astrotec’s own measurements.

When robust third-party measurements for Astrotec models become available (full-band FR ±dB, THD vs SPL, isolation), this rating should be revisited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Astrotec implements contemporary transducer tech rather than pushing novel electronics or DSP. Notable examples include the **planar-plus-PZT** hybrid in **Archimedes** (CNC metal shells, specified dual-sided magnet array) [3][5] and LCP diaphragms in budget DD models like **Vesna** [2]. These are competent, mainstream implementations; we do not find evidence of breakthrough system-level innovation or published technical papers/patents that would justify a higher score.

## Cost-Performance (company-wide)

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Representative set (weights reflect typical market pull: **budget 60%**, **upper-entry/planar 40%**):

1) **Budget DD:** **Vesna** — 19.90 USD (official store) [2].  
   **Cheapest equivalent-or-better**: **7Hz Salnotes Zero** — regular list 19.00 USD (Linsoul product page) [9]; widely reported neutral-leaning FR and low distortion baselines [6].  
   **Computation:** 19.00 USD ÷ 19.90 USD = **0.96**.

2) **Planar/PZT hybrid tier:** **Archimedes** — 129.99 USD (retail street, HiFiGo) [5].  
   **Cheapest equivalent-or-better (by user-facing function & measured FR/THD)**: **7Hz × Crinacle Zero:2** — ~25 USD (current street; 5128 FR database available) [7][10].  
   **Computation:** 25.00 USD ÷ 129.99 USD = **0.19**.

**Weighted company CP:** (0.96 × 0.6) + (0.19 × 0.4) = **0.65** → rounded to **0.7**.

**Equivalence note (minimal):** Both comparators are wired IEMs; third-party databases show **FR within transparent-leaning targets and low distortion** at least on par with typical entry planars/single-DDs [6][7][8][10].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Astrotec’s official warranty statement references **one (1)/two (2) years** depending on product/region/dealer, after which the user bears repair/replacement costs [11]. Build uses common, serviceable materials (aluminum or stainless shells, 2-pin connectors on many models) [2][3]. However, the support model is largely dealer-mediated and long-horizon reliability data remain scarce.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The brand focuses on audible transducer choices (LCP, planar, hybridization) and straightforward ergonomics (compact shells, standard connectors) [2][3]. We do not see strong evidence of measurement-driven iteration across releases (e.g., published before/after FR/THD targets), keeping the score modest.

## Advice

- **If you’re spending ~20 USD:** Vesna is a tidy package with an LCP DD; however, 7Hz Zero remains a price-to-performance benchmark backed by abundant third-party data [2][6][9].  
- **If you’re considering Archimedes for planar tech:** weigh it against cheaper, well-measured options (e.g., Zero:2 for tonality, or S12/S12 Pro if you specifically prefer a planar diaphragm feel) [7][8].  
- **Support/warranty:** confirm your retailer’s term (1–2 years) before purchase [11].
