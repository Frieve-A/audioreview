## Overview

Meters Music is a UK-based audio company established in 2017 by Ashdown Engineering, renowned manufacturers of bass guitar amplifiers used by major artists including U2, Foo Fighters, and Paul McCartney. Founded by Mark and Dan Gooday, the company was created to diversify from the declining amplifier market into the growing headphone sector. In recent years, Meters Music was acquired by Tampa-based ERA Music Brands. The company's signature design element is the inclusion of analog VU meters on their headphone products, directly inspired by Ashdown's bass amplifier heritage. Their current product lineup includes the OV-1-B-Connect wireless ANC headphones and LINX TWS earbuds, targeting consumers who prioritize aesthetic appeal and "musical" sound over measurement accuracy.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. The OV-1-B-Connect headphones provide only basic manufacturer specifications without credible third-party measurement verification. Critical performance data is missing: frequency response lacks deviation measurements (manufacturer claims "20Hz-20kHz" without ±dB tolerance specification), no harmonic distortion (THD) measurements available, no signal-to-noise ratio measurements provided, and no comprehensive ANC performance data beyond the claimed "82% background noise reduction" marketing language [1]. Without credible third-party measurements or comprehensive manufacturer specifications with proper test conditions, performance cannot be reliably assessed against established measurement criteria standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Meters Music demonstrates average technology implementation using contemporary but standard components. The company employs QCC3020 chips in LINX TWS earbuds, supporting aptX Adaptive codec functionality [1]. The OV-1-B-Connect model uses QCC5124 System-on-Chip and supports aptX HD codec functionality [2]. While these represent appropriate current-generation technology, they offer no proprietary innovations or competitive advantages beyond industry standards. The products appear to follow conventional OEM/ODM approaches using readily available components without significant technical differentiation or in-house patent technology development. The company benefits from in-house design capabilities leveraging Ashdown Engineering's amplifier heritage, though this experience primarily relates to bass amplification rather than headphone-specific acoustic engineering or DSP expertise. The analog VU meter implementation represents mechanical integration rather than advanced electronic innovation. No evidence exists of proprietary driver technology, advanced signal processing capabilities, or technical implementations that would require substantial time for competitors to replicate, resulting in minimal competitive advantage duration and average technology sophistication levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Meters Music products demonstrate poor cost-performance ratios when compared against functionally equivalent alternatives. The OV-1-B-Connect headphones are priced at 299.99 USD while providing ANC functionality, Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX HD, 16-hour battery life, 20Hz-20kHz frequency response, 94dB/mW sensitivity, and claimed 82% noise reduction. The Soundcore Life Q30 provides equivalent-or-better functionality: it offers superior ANC performance (95% tested measurement vs 82% claimed), superior frequency response range (16Hz-40kHz vs 20Hz-20kHz), equivalent Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity with aptX HD codec support, significantly longer battery life (40h vs 16h), and additional features including multipoint connection, custom EQ functionality, and transparency mode not present in the review target. All these equivalent-or-better specifications and enhanced features are available for 79.99 USD. CP = 79.99 USD ÷ 299.99 USD = 0.3. The comparison target is justified as equivalent-or-better because it matches all core technical specifications while providing superior measured ANC performance, enhanced battery operation, and additional user-facing connectivity and customization features, representing significantly better value for equivalent or superior functionality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Meters Music provides below-average reliability and support infrastructure compared to industry standards. The company offers only a standard 1-year warranty period, shorter than the typical 2-year industry standard, and this warranty is non-transferable and limited to original purchasers only [3]. Support infrastructure is minimal, consisting solely of email contact through ERA Music Brands (inquiries@eramusicbrands.com) without dedicated service centers, phone support, or comprehensive technical support systems. The warranty terms allow the company discretion to repair with new or refurbished parts, replace with equivalent products, or provide partial refunds, but exclude coverage for normal wear, commercial use, or any unauthorized modifications. The company's limited operational history since 2017 and recent acquisition by ERA Music Brands provides insufficient long-term reliability data for assessing failure rates or product longevity. The basic 30-day return policy, absence of extended support options, and limited repair infrastructure further restrict customer protection compared to established audio manufacturers with global service networks and longer warranty periods.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Meters Music's design philosophy demonstrates significant deviations from measurement-based audio engineering approaches. The company's philosophy is fundamentally linked to aesthetic VU meter design as "the defining feature" of their brand, emphasizing visual appeal over measurement-based performance optimization. This approach conflicts with evidence-based audio engineering principles by allocating significant development costs to aesthetic VU meter implementations that serve no functional audio purpose, representing investment in features unrelated to sound quality improvement. The company's emphasis on "musical expertise" over measurement-based optimization demonstrates a preference for subjective evaluation methods over scientific verification. Additionally, the conservative approach emphasizing heritage aesthetics over performance innovation fails to contribute meaningfully to achieving transparent performance levels or cost optimization. However, the company does employ contemporary technology such as QCC3020 chips and aptX HD codec support, indicating partial adoption of current technical standards rather than complete rejection of technological advancement.

## Advice

Meters Music products are not recommended for consumers prioritizing audio performance, measurement accuracy, or cost-effectiveness. The significant premium charged for aesthetic VU meter features cannot be justified given the substantial performance and value disadvantages compared to alternatives like the Soundcore Life Q30. Potential purchasers seeking functional ANC headphones should consider scientifically validated alternatives that provide superior measured performance at significantly lower costs. These products may only appeal to consumers who specifically value the visual aesthetic of analog meters over actual audio quality, understand they are paying a substantial premium for non-functional design elements, and accept below-average technical performance. For anyone seeking transparent audio reproduction, measurement-based performance, or reasonable cost-performance ratios, numerous superior alternatives exist at every price point.
