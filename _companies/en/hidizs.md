## Overview

HIDIZS, founded around 2014 with the launch of their AP100 portable Hi-Fi audio player at CES, positions itself as a "professional acoustic brand" focusing on high-fidelity audio equipment. The company operates across multiple product categories including portable music players (AP80 PRO series), DACs and amplifiers (S9 Pro Plus Martha, S8 Pro Robin, XO), in-ear monitors (MP143 Salt, MP145, MK12 Turris), and accessories. With a tagline of "Soulful Music Beyond Time and Space," HIDIZS emphasizes technological innovation while maintaining a diverse product ecosystem spanning entry-level to premium segments. The company has built a team of over 40 audio professionals and possesses R&D capabilities across the audio reproduction chain, including proprietary FPGA-based processing algorithms.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

HIDIZS products with third-party measurements demonstrate excellent performance that clearly exceeds transparent levels across key audio quality metrics. The S9 Pro achieves outstanding measurements with frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz within -0.48 to +0.04 dB [1], dynamic range exceeding 122 dB, and THD+N measurements between -103.1 and -104.6 dB, representing distortion levels well below 0.001%. The AP80 PRO-X similarly demonstrates very good performance with output impedance below 0.1Ω, THD+N around -95dB, flat frequency response, and excellent jitter performance with sidebands around -140dB [2]. However, key products including the flagship MP143 Salt IEM lack independent measurement verification, relying solely on manufacturer specifications. When significant portions of the product line lack credible third-party measurement verification, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 as manufacturer specifications may not accurately reflect actual performance. While measured products demonstrate excellent capability, the limited measurement availability across flagship products prevents higher scientific validity assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

HIDIZS demonstrates competent technical implementation with in-house design capabilities and appropriate adoption of current-generation technology. The company possesses R&D capability across the audio reproduction chain with FPGA-based processing algorithms and a team of over 40 experienced audio professionals. Products utilize current ESS DAC implementations including ES9038Q2M and dual ES9219C configurations, with software features like MSEB parametric tuning systems. The company shows technical expertise in planar magnetic driver development with proprietary 14.3mm implementations and symmetrical magnetic circuit designs. However, heavy reliance on standard ESS DAC components available to all competitors significantly limits technical differentiation and competitive advantage duration. Most competitors can achieve similar implementations with identical ESS components, and the lack of significant proprietary innovations beyond standard component implementations results in average technology level with limited barriers to competitive replication.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. HIDIZS products demonstrate average cost-performance when evaluated across representative product categories. For company evaluation, two key products are compared to establish overall cost-performance positioning. For the MP143 Salt priced at 159 USD (current market price), the Moondrop Chu II at 19 USD provides equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance [4]. The Chu II features a detachable 0.78mm 2-pin cable, 3.5mm connectivity, and third-party measurements demonstrate high adherence to neutral targets and low distortion. Compared to MP143 Salt's 103dB sensitivity and 20Hz-40kHz frequency response, the Chu II provides 119dB/Vrms sensitivity and 15Hz-38kHz frequency response, demonstrating equivalent-or-better measured performance. CP = 19 USD ÷ 159 USD = 0.12, rounded to 0.1. For the AP80 PRO-X at approximately 199 USD, the HiBy R3 II at 179 USD offers superior 4.4mm balanced output, larger 3.2-inch touchscreen, and higher power output specifications. Compared to AP80 PRO-X's measured performance (output impedance below 0.1Ω, THD+N around -95dB, flat frequency response, jitter performance with sidebands around -140dB [2]), the HiBy R3 II provides equivalent-or-better numerical performance with balanced output specifications including THD 0.0005%, SNR 119dB, dynamic range 115dB, output power 380mW@32Ω, and frequency response 20Hz-90kHz [5]. CP = 179 USD ÷ 199 USD = 0.90. Average CP across categories: (0.1 + 0.9) ÷ 2 = 0.5. While HIDIZS maintains competitive positioning in some categories, more affordable alternatives exist with equivalent functionality and superior measured performance in key product segments.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

HIDIZS provides below-average reliability and support coverage compared to industry standards. Warranty periods are limited to 12 months for players and only 6 months for cables, significantly below the typical industry average of 24 months. Support infrastructure relies primarily on standard email contact with repair-or-replace policies at company discretion. The company does provide firmware update support through their download center for products including ST2 PRO, S3 Pro, AP80 PRO-X, and AP200, demonstrating ongoing product support. However, no global support system, extended support periods, or special support services are mentioned. With approximately 10 years in business since 2014, HIDIZS shows operational stability but lacks exceptional reliability track records or enhanced support infrastructure that would justify higher evaluation in this category.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

HIDIZS presents a contradictory design philosophy that acknowledges measurement importance while simultaneously promoting scientifically questionable concepts about unmeasurable auditory differences. The company's core philosophy emphasizes psychoacoustics and subjective differences that "modern science has yet to fully explain," claiming different listeners experience different perceptions with identical audio equipment. They compare audio reproduction to "paintings vs prints" and emphasize capturing "artistic details" that lack scientific basis for audibility. These claims contradict established scientific consensus on audibility thresholds and represent irrational approaches to audio design. However, practical product development demonstrates rational technology adoption with efficient use of current ESS DAC implementations, functional integration of digital processing and software features, and technical advancement in newer models. The company's engagement with measurement communities, including submitting products to Audio Science Review, suggests the problematic philosophy may be more marketing-oriented than design-driving, though the explicit promotion of unmeasurable psychoacoustic effects remains concerning for rational audio design.

## Advice

HIDIZS products may appeal to users seeking competently engineered audio equipment with excellent measured performance in their DAC and portable player categories where third-party measurements confirm transparent-level performance. The S9 Pro and AP80 PRO-X demonstrate that HIDIZS can execute solid technical implementations with performance exceeding industry standards. However, when evaluated solely on measured performance basis, the company's key products face more affordable alternatives, resulting in average cost-performance positioning. The company's shorter warranty periods and limited support infrastructure should be factored into purchase decisions, particularly for users requiring extended product support. Most concerning is HIDIZS's explicit promotion of psychoacoustic concepts and unmeasurable auditory differences that contradict scientific consensus, which may mislead users about the actual benefits of their products. For users prioritizing rational, measurement-based audio equipment selection, HIDIZS offers competitive technical execution though competitors like FiiO and Topping provide more scientifically sound marketing approaches.
