## Overview
ROSESELSA (formerly Rose Technics) develops TWS earbuds, IEMs, dongle DAC/amps, and desktop DAC/amps. The company has been expanding into Europe, North America, and APAC since 2024 [1]. This review evaluates representative in-line products against the cheapest equal-or-better competitors using verifiable specs and measurements.

## Scientific Validity
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$
Key numbers are **manufacturer/retailer-stated** with sparse third-party standardized bench data so far. Examples: EarFree i5 supports LDAC and claims 48 dB ANC [2]; RS9039 is advertised at up to 126 dB SNR [4]. RT-5000 uses dual ES9038Pro but widely published APx-class measurements are scarce [5]. Until independent datasets broaden, we cap this at **0.6**.

## Technology Level
$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$
Modern choices across categories: LDAC on TWS [2], ES9039Q2M in the RS9039 dongle [3], and dual ES9038Pro on the desktop RT-5000 [5]. I/O breadth and balanced outputs are competitive for 2024–2025. Solid contemporary implementation overall.

## Cost-Performance
$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$
**Method**: identify the **cheapest** competitor with equal-or-better functions/measured performance; compute **(competitor price) ÷ (ROSESELSA price)** per category and average (rounded to 0.1).

- **Dongle DAC/amp**: **TempoTec Sonata BHD Pro** (3.5 mm + 4.4 mm, SNR 131 dB / THD+N 0.00012%) **59.90 USD** [7]  
  vs **ROSESELSA RS9039** **68.99 USD** [3] → **59.90 USD ÷ 68.99 USD = 0.868** → 0.9

- **Desktop DAC/amp**: **SMSL DO400** **499.99 USD** [6]  
  vs **RT-5000** **619.99 USD** [5] → **499.99 USD ÷ 619.99 USD = 0.806** → 0.8

**Average**: (0.9 + 0.8) / 2 = **0.85** → **0.9**.

## Reliability & Support
$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$
Global presence is growing, but publicly available long-term failure-rate/RMA data are limited. With no clear evidence of above-average warranty depth or global repair infrastructure, we assess **industry average (0.5)** for now.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy
$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$
The brand prioritizes measurable, user-facing benefits (modern codecs, practical I/O) over esoteric claims, aligning with measurement-driven development. Emphasis on value density and contemporary silicon choices is **rational** for audible parity targets.

## Advice
If you want objective-leaning specs and strong value, ROSESELSA is worth shortlisting. **RS9039** is a capable 4.4 mm dongle contender; **RT-5000** is full-featured but faces firm price pressure from **SMSL DO400**. For TWS, LDAC/ANC support is attractive; treat manufacturer figures as provisional until robust third-party tests arrive.
