## Overview

Focusrite was founded in 1985 in the UK by legendary console designer Rupert Neve. The company began with a request from George Martin to develop custom console preamps for AIR Studio, establishing their reputation with the ISA (Input Signal Amplifier). Currently operating as Focusrite PLC with 8 brands, they specialize exclusively in audio interface manufacturing, stating "we manufacture only audio interfaces, and we are the world's best at it." The Scarlett Gen 4 incorporates converters from their professional RedNet series, leveraging 40 years of accumulated technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Scarlett 18i20 Gen 4 (122dB dynamic range, THD+N -100dB, 24bit/192kHz support) achieves excellent measurement performance exceeding transparency levels (105dB). Professional RedNet series converter adoption ensures transparency across the entire audible spectrum at 24bit/192kHz resolution. The 69dB microphone preamp gain maintains -95dB THD, representing scientifically excellent performance. Significant performance improvements over previous Scarlett 3rd Gen meet transparency levels across all measurement criteria. ESS Sabre32 Ultra DAC technology matches that of thousand-dollar high-end equipment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

40 years of technological accumulation provides industry-leading microphone preamp design capabilities. Inheriting ISA preamp design philosophy, they have established low-noise, high-gain analog circuit technology. RedNet converter deployment to lower-tier models is technically significant, successfully applying professional equipment technology to consumer devices. ASIO driver optimization is excellent, contributing to low-latency achievement. However, basic design primarily utilizes off-the-shelf DAC/ADC chips from ESS and others, with limited proprietary development. Detailed technical specifications like clock precision remain undisclosed.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Scarlett 18i20 Gen 4 (market price ~600-700 USD, 122dB dynamic range, RedNet converter) demonstrates CP advantage compared to RME Babyface Pro FS (~750 USD, equivalent measurement performance). More notably, compared to MOTU M4 (220 USD, ESS Sabre32 Ultra), Scarlett's advantage is clear even considering I/O count differences. Particularly in the Scarlett 2i2 Gen 4 (200 USD) class, few competitors offer equivalent performance, yielding very good CP. Professional equipment technology deployment to consumer devices provides high cost-efficiency relative to measurement performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

40 years of business continuity and global market share demonstrate reliability credentials. Scarlett series long-term support records are positive with continuous driver updates from Gen 1 to present. Standard 3-year warranty exceeds industry average. UK headquarters technical support is prompt, with comprehensive support infrastructure through authorized dealers in Japan. Long-term usage records are positive, with Scarlett 2i2 serving as "at-home recording studio revolution symbol" for over 10 years. Firmware updates are regular with prompt latest OS support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Clear corporate strategy of "specializing exclusively in audio interface manufacturing" enables extremely rational design philosophy balancing measurement performance and practicality. RedNet converter deployment to lower-tier models represents scientifically correct approach of applying professional equipment technology to consumer devices. Microphone preamp low-noise and high-gain improvements directly contribute to recording quality enhancement through rational technical choices. ASIO driver optimization for latency reduction reflects practicality-focused design philosophy. The only issue is references to subjective elements like "musicality," but actual product design consistently follows scientific measurement-focused approaches.

## Advice

Focusrite Group operates as comprehensive audio company with 13 brands spanning wide product ranges. Audio interfaces (Focusrite), synthesizers (Sequential, Oberheim, Novation), monitor speakers (ADAM Audio), and PA systems (Martin Audio) lead their respective markets. Scarlett series represents core products, particularly the 2i2 (personal use) to 18i20 (studio use) lineup establishing industry standards. RedNet converter technology deployment to lower-tier models achieves professional quality at consumer prices. Main competitors include RME, MOTU, and Presonus, but RedNet technology maintains technical advantages.
