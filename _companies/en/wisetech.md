## Overview

WiseTech, Inc. was established in 2006 in Tokyo, Japan, and launched the NOBUNAGA Labs brand in 2014. The company specializes in audio cable re-cables and accessories, primarily targeting IEM and headphone applications. NOBUNAGA Labs markets itself as offering "high quality products and customer service at an affordable price" with 100% Japanese design, focusing on re-cables for portable audio and professional audio applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

WiseTech's products lack meaningful audio performance measurements to validate claimed improvements. Cable impedance is specified at 0.5Ω or less, which is reasonable for signal transmission, but no published measurement data exists for frequency response, THD, SNR, crosstalk, or other audio performance metrics. Claims of audible improvements from cryo-treatment at -156°C and premium conductor materials lack scientific substantiation through controlled testing or ABX trials. The absence of any measurable performance data places this significantly below problematic levels according to measurement criteria standards.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The technology represents mature, widely-available approaches with no significant innovation. WiseTech uses standard OFC (Oxygen Free Copper) and silver-plated copper conductors, conventional cryo-treatment processes, and MMCX connectors with gold plating. No proprietary patents, innovative design elements, or technical sophistication beyond industry commodity levels were identified. Manufacturing appears to be essentially assembly of off-the-shelf components without in-house design innovation, placing the technology level significantly below industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

WiseTech's NOBUNAGA Labs cables are currently priced at 60-399 USD, providing MMCX connectivity with OFC/silver-plated copper conductors and gold-plated connectors. TRN 8-core MMCX cables at 15 USD are equipped with MMCX connectivity, 8-core pure silver construction, multiple termination options, and impedance specifications are equivalent-or-better. Using TRN 8-core as the comparison target: 15 ÷ 60 = 0.25, which rounds to 0.3. Multiple alternative products exist with superior specifications at significantly lower prices, including KZ 8-core cables (11 USD) and NiceHCK SPC cables (17 USD), all offering equivalent or better functionality and construction quality.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

WiseTech offers only a 1-month warranty period, significantly below the industry standard 2-year average. Multiple user reports document systematic failure within "a few months under standard use" across different price tiers (30, 60, and 99 USD models). Identified weak points include lack of strain relief around connectors and MMCX connector design issues [6]. The 15-day defect replacement policy provides minimal coverage compared to standard warranty practices. The systematic nature of failures across different price points suggests fundamental design or manufacturing issues, placing reliability at the problematic threshold.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The design philosophy demonstrates significant irrational aspects, including scientifically unsupported claims of audible improvements from cryo-treatment and premium conductor materials in cable applications. No measurement-focused approach to sound quality validation is evident, relying primarily on subjective marketing claims rather than objective performance data. The majority of product cost appears unrelated to measurable performance improvements, with premium pricing lacking technical justification when comparable functionality is available at significantly lower cost points. The approach emphasizes subjective qualities over measurable performance, with claims contrary to established cable science regarding audible differences from conductor materials in this application.

## Advice

WiseTech's NOBUNAGA Labs products face significant challenges in cost-performance and reliability that make them difficult to recommend. The premium pricing of 60-399 USD cannot be justified when equivalent functionality is available from TRN, KZ, and other manufacturers at 15-31 USD with superior or equivalent specifications. The documented reliability issues, including systematic failures within months and inadequate warranty coverage, present substantial risk for potential buyers. Those requiring MMCX cables should consider established alternatives with better cost-performance ratios and reliability track records. The company would benefit from adopting measurement-focused validation of performance claims and addressing the fundamental reliability and strain relief issues that have been consistently reported by users.
