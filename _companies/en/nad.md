summary: "Canadian audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1972. Latest streaming integrated amplifiers like the Masters M33 achieve exceptional measured performance with THD<0.00017% through Purifi Eigentakt technology. However, in terms of pricing, equivalent functionality can be realized with PC-based DAC solutions (RME ADI-2 + miniDSP SHD, etc.) at less than half the cost, making cost-performance limited even considering integrated convenience."

## Overview

NAD is a Canadian audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1972. Known by the acronym "New Acoustic Dimension," the company has built its reputation by providing high-performance amplifiers at accessible prices. Recently, they offer a wide product lineup from latest streaming integrated amplifiers like the Masters M33 V2 (approximately USD 4,000) to separate configurations like the C658 (approximately USD 1,200) + C298 (approximately USD 1,465).

The 2025 model M33 V2 particularly combines Purifi Eigentakt technology with ESS SABRE DAC, BluOS integrated platform, and Dirac Live room correction, achieving both measured performance and practicality. The transition from traditional analog-focused approaches to actively embracing digital technology represents a characteristic modern design shift.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The measured data for Masters M33 V2 is extremely excellent, with THD<0.00017% (full power, full frequency range) being an objectively verifiable performance figure. The output of 200W+200W (8Ω) and 700W (bridged) is also confirmed through actual measurements. The effectiveness of Dirac Live room correction can be measured as frequency response improvements, providing scientific basis. The C298's 185W+185W (8Ω) and 340W+340W (4Ω) are also reliable as measured values, with overall product development based on measurement data rather than subjective evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The adoption of Purifi Eigentakt technology is technically advanced, achieving superior efficiency and low distortion compared to traditional Class AB amplification circuits. The design combining ESS SABRE ES9039PRO DAC, BluOS integrated platform, and Dirac Live correction with modern technologies is highly commendable. Through the fusion of over 50 years of amplification circuit design experience with latest digital technology, they achieve products that balance measured performance with practicality. However, basic technologies largely overlap with other manufacturers, limiting uniqueness in terms of originality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The streaming, DAC, and room correction functions of Masters M33 V2 (USD 4,000) can be realized with equivalent or superior performance using RME ADI-2 DAC FS (USD 800) + miniDSP SHD (USD 935) combination for USD 1,735, resulting in CP = USD 1,735 ÷ USD 4,000 = 0.43. Furthermore, basic streaming functionality can be achieved with Topping D90 (USD 465) + Raspberry Pi + Volumio (USD 135) combination for USD 600, yielding CP = USD 600 ÷ USD 4,000 = 0.15. The C658 (USD 1,200) can also achieve equivalent functionality with miniDSP SHD Studio (USD 665), resulting in CP = USD 665 ÷ USD 1,200 = 0.56. Even considering integrated convenience, price competitiveness against PC-based DAC solutions is limited.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

With over 50 years of manufacturing experience and quality control in Canada, reliability maintains high standards. The BluOS integrated platform continues functional improvements through regular software updates, with established long-term support structure. However, for products heavily utilizing digital technology, risks of future compatibility issues and support termination are higher than pure analog products. Global sales networks are well-established, with generally satisfactory after-sales service.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The combination of basic amplification circuit design with latest digital technology is rational. The adoption of Dirac Live room correction is practical, with scientifically-based sound quality improvement approaches. However, BluOS integration and built-in streaming functionality represent redundant aspects from a pure amplifier functionality perspective. Additionally, pricing for high-end models is set higher relative to technical advantages, making it not entirely rational. Traditional "sound quality" focused evaluation criteria also partially remain, with scientifically-based evaluation not thoroughly implemented in all aspects.

## Advice

NAD serves as an excellent choice for modern amplifier manufacturers that balance measured performance with practicality for many applications.

- **Integrated solution seekers**: Masters M33 V2 costs USD 4,000 as an integrated unit, but RME ADI-2 DAC FS (USD 800) + miniDSP SHD (USD 935) + Benchmark AHB2 (USD 2,665) combination at USD 4,400 provides equivalent or superior performance and flexibility.
- **Separate component enthusiasts**: miniDSP SHD Studio (USD 665) offers equivalent streaming and room correction functionality USD 535 cheaper than C658 (USD 1,200).
- **Budget-conscious users**: Topping D90 (USD 465) + Raspberry Pi + Volumio (USD 135) combination realizes basic streaming functionality at one-third the price of NAD solutions.

Compared to PC-based DAC solutions, NAD's pricing is not rational even considering integrated convenience. While technically excellent, other options should be considered if cost-performance is the priority.
