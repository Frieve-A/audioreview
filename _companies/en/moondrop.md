## Overview

Moondrop Technology Co., Ltd. was founded in 2015 by Herbert Zheng, headquartered in Chengdu, China. Starting as a small studio, they now represent "Chi-Fi" (Chinese Hi-Fi) with operations in over 20 countries and regions worldwide.

The company adopts tuning based on the Harman target curve, conducting product development using industry-standard measurement equipment including Audio Precision APx555 and B&K Type4128c HATS. Measurement data for products like Aria (USD 53), Starfield (USD 73), and Blessing2 (USD 233) shows superior characteristics compared to competing products in their respective price ranges.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Moondrop employs a thoroughly scientific approach based on measurement data. Their products are designed to comply with the widely accepted Harman target curve, which is based on extensive listening experiments with scientific foundation. For example, Aria 2's THD+N≤0.05% (@1kHz) specification achieves distortion characteristics well below the audible range. Their proprietary LCP (Liquid Crystal Polymer) diaphragm has theoretically and practically confirmed low-distortion characteristics, with effects verified by numerous independent measurement institutions.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company uses proprietary LCP (Liquid Crystal Polymer) diaphragm 10mm dynamic drivers combined with brass acoustic cavities. Multi-BA driver and hybrid configuration products implement crossover designs. Their development environment includes measurement equipment like Audio Precision APx555, utilizing high-precision 3D printing and software simulation. They hold multiple patents in communications technology and design fields.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Aria (USD 53) shows CP = USD 37 ÷ USD 53 = 0.7, as cheapest products with equivalent measurement performance (THD+N 0.05%, sensitivity 122dB/Vrms, frequency response 20Hz-20kHz) exist at USD 37. Starfield (USD 73) has competing products at USD 51, yielding CP = USD 51 ÷ USD 73 = 0.7. Blessing2 (USD 233) equivalent performance competitors exist at USD 167, resulting in CP = USD 167 ÷ USD 233 = 0.71. While their products achieve high cost-performance overturning traditional pricing conventions, even more affordable competing products exist, resulting in this evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Public RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) rates and failure report data since market introduction remain limited. Product warranty period is 1 year. Global after-sales service locations are fewer compared to established Western manufacturers. Firmware update support is limited to higher-priced products, with entry-level models receiving hardware-only support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company adopts tuning based on the Harman target curve, conducting measurement data-based design. Driver configuration and cavity design are determined according to each product's price range. Aria's brass cavity represents material selection considering acoustic characteristics impact. LCP diaphragm adoption is based on material physical properties (low density, high rigidity). No unscientific elements are included in their design.

## Advice

They provide product lineups suitable for users who value measurement data-based design.

- **Price-range Products**: Aria 2 (USD 53) with THD+N≤0.05%, Starfield (USD 73) with sensitivity 122dB/Vrms, Blessing2 Dusk (USD 233) with multi-BA configuration are available in respective price ranges.
- **Technical Specifications**: Standard specifications include frequency response 20Hz-20kHz, impedance 32-33Ω, sensitivity 122dB/Vrms.

Purchasing through authorized distributors provides 1-year product warranty and after-sales service.
