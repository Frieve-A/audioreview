## Overview

Telefunken Elektroakustik of South Windsor, Connecticut carries on a legacy started over a century ago in Germany, manufacturing premium microphones and professional audio equipment for studio and stage applications. Founded in 2001 to create restoration parts for vintage microphones, the company has evolved into a respected manufacturer of both vintage-inspired tube microphones and modern FET designs. Their product lineup spans from ultra-premium Diamond Series tube microphones like the ELA M 251E and U47 to more accessible options including the M80 dynamic microphone and newer TF17 FET condenser. Assembly and test occur in Connecticut with component-level QC and final-frequency-response verification [2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Manufacturer specifications indicate strong measured performance in several current models. The M60 FET small-diaphragm condenser lists amplifier THD < 0.01%, amplifier S/N > 89 dBA, and amplifier self-noise ≤ 5 dBA (circuit-only), with max SPL > 135 dB and 20 Hz–20 kHz response [3]. The ELA M 251E tube LDC specifies THD < 0.2% @ 1 kHz, S/N 85 dBA, max SPL 130 dB, and 20 Hz–20 kHz within ±3 dB [1]. The M80 dynamic provides an extended 50 Hz–18 kHz range and high SPL handling in stage use [4]. These values support competent capture; however, several tube models intentionally pursue euphonic coloration aligned with vintage voicing rather than transparency to the source, so absolute neutrality is not the design goal for those products.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Telefunken demonstrates high technical sophistication via in-house capsule manufacturing (e.g., CK12-style large-diaphragm capsules), custom transformers (e.g., Haufe T14/1), and rigorous test workflows: parts are screened, tubes and full amplifiers are burned-in, and every microphone is assembled and tested in South Windsor, CT [2]. The company also built precision frequency-response test chambers paired with Audio Precision analyzers to ensure accurate, repeatable measurements of level/FR/phase [5]. These practices reflect a mature engineering culture and strong quality control.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

To evaluate company-level cost-performance, we selected four representative current products that span the Diamond (flagship), Alchemy (modern), SDC, and Dynamic series, then computed a **simple average** of product-level CP because market share by model is undisclosed. For each product, CP is calculated as **cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator price ÷ review target price**.

- **ELA M 251E (Telefunken)** — reference tube LDC  
  Price: **11,995 USD** [1].  
  Comparator: **Warm Audio WA-251** (tube LDC, same three polar patterns, 20 Hz–20 kHz FR, higher max SPL 132 dB vs 130 dB; broadly comparable measured performance for the intended application) [8][9].  
  **CP = 899 USD ÷ 11,995 USD = 0.075** → 0.1 (rounded to one decimal).

- **TF17 (Telefunken)** — modern FET LDC (cardioid)  
  Price: **895 USD** [10].  
  Comparator: **Lewitt LCT 440 PURE** (cardioid LDC; FR 20 Hz–20 kHz, max SPL 140 dB, very low self-noise 7 dB-A; equal-or-better core specs for neutral capture) [12][13].  
  **CP = 299 USD ÷ 895 USD = 0.334** → 0.3.

- **M60 FET (Telefunken)** — SDC (cardioid set)  
  Price (single mic): **749 USD** [3].  
  Comparator: **sE Electronics sE8** (SDC; FR 20 Hz–20 kHz, max SPL up to 159 dB with pads, self-noise 13 dB-A; equal-or-better user-facing specs) [6][7].  
  **CP = 249 USD ÷ 749 USD = 0.332** → 0.3.

- **M80 (Telefunken)** — handheld dynamic (vocal)  
  Price: **249 USD** [4].  
  Comparator: **sE Electronics V7** (supercardioid dynamic; FR 40 Hz–19 kHz and very high max SPL 168 dB; equal-or-better stage-use performance envelope) [6][11].  
  **CP = 98 USD ÷ 249 USD = 0.394** → 0.4.

**Company CP score** (simple average of the above CPs) = (0.075 + 0.334 + 0.332 + 0.394) / 4 = **0.284** → **0.3** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

- **Build & QC**: Hand assembly and multi-stage QC (component screening, tube burn-in, FR checks) in Connecticut [2].  
- **Test infrastructure**: Dedicated frequency-response chambers with reference mics and Audio Precision systems [5].  
- **Warranty**: With product registration, warranty becomes **1 year parts/labor for capsule & tube, and 4 years for amplifier & power supply**; vacuum tubes carry **90-day** coverage [6][7].  
These factors indicate robust reliability and support aligned with professional workflows.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Positive aspects include measurement-based QC, investment in test facilities, and availability of FET designs capable of neutral capture. However, continued emphasis on vintage tube voicing prioritizes subjectively pleasing coloration over strict transparency. For buyers seeking neutrality per dollar, many third-party options match core functions and measured performance at substantially lower cost.

## Advice

Telefunken suits professionals who specifically need the sonic behavior of classic tube microphones and accept premium pricing for that aesthetic. For neutral, budget-sensitive capture, the **M60 FET** and **TF17** are the most rational entries in Telefunken’s range, but strong value alternatives exist (e.g., sE8, LCT 440 PURE). Choose Telefunken primarily when its build quality and vintage voicing are required by the project brief.
