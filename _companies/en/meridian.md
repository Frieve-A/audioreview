## Overview

Founded in 1977 by Bob Stuart and Allen Boothroyd, Meridian Audio has been a pioneer leading the digital technology revolution in the audio industry. They particularly made their name with "DSP speakers" - the world's first consumer active speakers integrating digital signal processing (DSP). The company questioned the traditional methodology of combining separate components like speakers, amplifiers, DACs, and crossovers, pursuing a scientific and rational approach that optimizes all elements as a single system. Recently, they're also known as developers of "MQA (Master Quality Authenticated)," a controversial new format for high-resolution audio sources.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Meridian's philosophy is deeply rooted in modern acoustic science and digital signal processing technology, making it extremely scientific. Their approach of using DSP to correct frequency response and temporal distortions in the digital domain - caused by physical limitations of speaker drivers and room acoustics - is highly effective and rational. Particularly, their proprietary "apodising filter" that corrects pre-ringing distortion occurring during recording symbolizes their stance on pursuing temporal accuracy. While MQA format has debates regarding its effectiveness and business model, the theoretical background focusing on temporal information importance is based on scientific inquiry. Overall, their emphasis on measurement and correction over subjective "sound tuning" deserves high praise.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Meridian possesses world-class technology in digital audio. Their DSP active speakers design and optimize crossovers, power amplifiers, DACs, and speaker drivers entirely in-house, building integrated systems that achieve levels impossible with assembled individual components. This enables sending optimal signals directly to each driver while controlling phase and frequency characteristics with extreme precision. This system design philosophy and advanced DSP programming capability to realize it represents core technology that others cannot match.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Meridian's DSP speaker systems are extremely expensive, even considering integrated amplifiers and DACs. For example, even entry-level DSP speakers exceed USD 6,700 per pair, with higher models reaching hundreds of thousands to over USD 67,000. Since this review policy evaluates value as function and performance divided by price, necessarily high absolute prices of Meridian products result in low scores. Equivalent performance can be achieved by combining passive speakers, DACs, and power amplifiers individually at much lower cost, hence this evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

As a UK high-end brand, Meridian boasts excellent quality and long-term reliability. Products are robustly built and designed for long-term use. Additionally, an enthusiastic user community exists where information exchange and maintenance know-how for older models are shared, supporting long-term asset value. They provide the high level of support and reliability expected from high-end brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Meridian's design philosophy is supremely rational from a "system optimization" perspective. Audio reproduction quality depends on countless variables including component compatibility, cables, and installation environment. Meridian aims to eliminate these variables as much as possible through DSP active speakers, reproducing intended designer performance at the user's location. This represents an extremely logical, waste-free approach that scientists and engineers idealize. Their philosophy pursuing overall rather than partial optimization deserves full marks.

## Advice

Meridian represents one of the ultimate choices for users who prefer a "scientific approach to audio." If you want freedom from component selection hassles and focus on reproducing recorded sound sources as accurately as possible, their DSP speaker systems provide ideal solutions. No complex wiring is needed, and their refined design harmonizes with modern living spaces. However, enjoying this philosophy and performance requires very high initial investment. For users who understand this value and spare no expense, this brand will provide the ultimate satisfaction.
