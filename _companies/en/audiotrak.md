## Overview

AUDIOTRAK is a Korean audio brand established in the late 1990s that specializes in computer audio solutions including USB DACs, headphone amplifiers, and sound cards. Originally a division of ESI (ESIO GmbH), the brand became known for products like the Prodigy series, DR.DAC2 DX series, and Maya audio interfaces. AUDIOTRAK positions itself as delivering precise, detailed, and neutral sound for audiophiles and PC audio enthusiasts, emphasizing measurement-focused design with quality component selection.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

AUDIOTRAK demonstrates mixed measurement performance across its product line. The Prodigy Cube achieves 108dB dynamic range [1], significantly exceeding the 105dB transparent threshold and representing excellent performance. The Prodigy 7.1 achieves 106dB D/A and 102dB A/D dynamic range [2], meeting transparent levels. However, the Maya 44 USB shows only 87dB dynamic range [3], falling below the 90dB problematic threshold. Frequency response across the product line maintains standard 20Hz-20kHz coverage [3]. The significant performance variation between higher-end and budget models results in average positioning between transparent and problematic measurement levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

AUDIOTRAK employs industry-standard technical implementation using established components including Wolfson WM8776 DAC chips and VIA Envy24HT controllers. The engineering approach demonstrates competence with quality passive components (WIMA capacitors, Alps potentiometers), 4-layer PCB construction with EMI shielding, and socketed op-amps allowing user customization. However, no proprietary patents or significant technological innovations distinguish the designs from competitors. The technology represents solid engineering practices using mature, proven solutions rather than cutting-edge advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Cost-performance is recalculated using the **cheapest product that is not inferior in both functions and measured performance**.  
Representative AUDIOTRAK model: **Prodigy Cube** — 24-bit/96kHz DAC, **dual headphone outputs**, **line out**, **coaxial S/PDIF out**, **microphone input**, analog **volume control**, and **108dB dynamic range** [1]. Typical street price used here: **135 USD**.

Cheapest not-worse alternative found: **ASUS Xonar U7 MKII** — **114dB SNR**, integrated headphone amp, **Line-in/Mic-in combo**, **coaxial S/PDIF out**, clickable **volume knob/output selector**, 192kHz/24-bit support [4][5]. Official webshop price listed at **79.90 CHF** (≈ ~90 USD) [6].  

Resulting CP ratio (cheapest equal-or-better ÷ target): **≈0.67 → 0.7** (rounded to one decimal). This indicates that equivalent-or-better capability is available for roughly two-thirds of AUDIOTRAK’s representative price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Driver and long-term support can be inconsistent across legacy models, and market availability is limited in many regions. Construction quality is generally positive due to solid component choices and socketed op-amps that aid serviceability, but the legacy status of several products and constrained distribution create risk for prospective buyers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

AUDIOTRAK maintains rational design philosophy without non-scientific claims or occult audio approaches. The measurement-focused approach using proven components demonstrates appropriate cost-effectiveness for intended price points. Technology adoption follows conservative patterns using mature, established solutions rather than cutting-edge innovation. Functional integration provides clear audio improvement purposes with reasonable feature sets. However, the conservative approach lacks innovative elements or advanced technology adoption that would elevate the design philosophy above industry average levels.

## Advice

Given the recalculated cost-performance, AUDIOTRAK products—while capable—are often undercut by **ASUS Xonar U7 MKII** that matches or exceeds core functions and measured performance at a lower official list price. Consider AUDIOTRAK only if you specifically need its feature set or find significant discounts; otherwise, modern alternatives like the U7 MKII provide superior value and broader ongoing support.
