## Overview

Founded in 2004, Aune Audio manufactures desktop DAC/amp combos, headphone amplifiers and headphones. Recent efforts include the MLD (Multi-Layer Distributed) diaphragm used in its AR-series headphones[5][11].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

- **S9c Pro (manufacturer specs):** line-out THD+N 0.00022% and dynamic range 122 dB are documented in official materials[2][3]. These values meet transparency thresholds within the audible band.  
- **Independent data:** ASR measured the Aune X1S (ESS9018K2M) at roughly **111 dB SINAD** on the DAC path[1]. The same unit’s headphone output impedance has been reported around **5.9 Ω**, which can interact with low-impedance IEMs[1].  
- **Headphones:** AR5000 lists **THD < 0.03% @1 kHz / 100 dB SPL** and **5–41 kHz** bandwidth (manufacturer)[6].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

S9c Pro combines dual ES9068A DACs with a full clock-sync scheme (2nd-gen ultra-low-jitter PLL, 10 MHz clock input) and a fully discrete headphone amplifier with twin-JFET inputs delivering up to 5 W[2][3]. On the headphone side, Aune’s MLD diaphragm and ergonomic architecture are the noteworthy innovations[11]. Overall, the brand excels at thoughtful integration of mature technologies rather than breakthrough silicon.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Typical market price for S9c Pro is **699 USD**[9][10]. A cheaper **equivalent-or-better transparency path** is **JDS Labs Atom Amp 2 + Atom DAC 2** for **258 USD** total[7][8]. While the JDS stack omits extras like balanced outs or external clocking, it delivers transparent performance and ample real-world power. Applying the defined formula:

- **CP = 258 USD ÷ 699 USD ≈ 0.37 → shown as 0.4.**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The EU official store states **24-month warranty** and **ships from Germany**, with shipping terms clearly listed[2][4]. Aune maintains current product information and a support portal on its official site; the company has operated since **2004**[5].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Aune emphasizes measurable fidelity (THD+N, noise, FR) and practical implementation. S9c Pro’s clock-sync architecture and discrete amplifier, and the AR5000’s MLD driver, are rational means to reduce distortion/noise and improve usability without leaning on unverifiable claims[2][3][11].

## Advice

- Choose **S9c Pro** if you want an all-in-one with robust power, balanced outputs, and clock features at transparent performance levels[2][3].  
- If you don’t need the extras and want the best value, the **JDS Labs Atom stack** achieves transparency for far less money[7][8].  
- For open-back headphones with an interesting driver architecture, **AR5000** is worth a look[6][11].
