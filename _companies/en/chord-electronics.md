## Overview

Chord Electronics is a high-end audio manufacturer founded in the UK in 1989. Founder John Franks is an aviation electronics specialist, later joined by digital signal processing expert Robert Watts, who developed proprietary FPGA-based digital processing technology. The company particularly excels in DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) products, using unique architectures that don't rely on conventional DAC chips to achieve extremely high performance. Products like DAVE, Hugo, and Qutest have earned high praise worldwide from audio enthusiasts for their distinctive design and exceptional sound quality, with technical superiority particularly evident in high-resolution audio playback.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Chord Electronics' DAC products demonstrate extremely excellent measurement characteristics. Their flagship model DAVE records industry-leading measurements including THD+N -127.5dB and SNR 127dB, with clear differences confirmed in ABX tests. Through proprietary FPGA-based processing, they achieve high-precision digital processing impossible with conventional DAC chips. Technologies including noise shaping, higher-order delta-sigma modulation, and proprietary filtering are all scientifically based. However, audible differences compared to top-tier equipment may be limited in some cases.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Chord Electronics' technical standards are industry-leading. Founder John Franks' aviation electronics knowledge combined with Robert Watts' deep digital signal processing expertise enables unique DAC designs using FPGAs. The technology of implementing massive parallel 1-bit DACs using FPGAs rather than conventional DAC chips offers uniqueness unmatched by competitors. They lead the cutting edge in digital processing technology with high sampling frequency support, proprietary noise shaping technology, and high-precision clock circuits. Manufacturing quality is also extremely high, with cases machined from aluminum billets and internal circuit implementation representing industry-leading standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Chord Electronics products are extremely expensive, resulting in harsh evaluation from a cost-performance perspective. For example, DAC products with equivalent measurement performance to Chord DAVE (USD 13,333) are available from RME ADI-2 DAC (USD 1,333) or Topping D90SE (USD 533). Based on the cost-performance calculation formula, CP = USD 533 รท USD 13,333 = 0.04. From a pure performance-to-price perspective, they are extremely overpriced.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Chord Electronics offers high reliability meeting quality standards for luxury equipment. They provide a 2-year warranty period with support systems through distributors worldwide. Failure rates are low, with particularly excellent analog circuit reliability. Digital components also offer stable long-term operation due to FPGA characteristics. However, repair part procurement costs are very high, especially when specialized component replacement is needed. Firmware updates are regularly provided with feature improvements and new functionality additions. Comprehensive support is available in Japan through authorized distributors.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Chord Electronics' design philosophy is extremely rational, pursuing pure technical superiority. Based on founder John Franks' aviation electronics experience and Robert Watts' deep digital signal processing knowledge, designs are based on measurement data and theoretical foundations. The proprietary FPGA-based architecture is a rational approach to overcome limitations of conventional DAC chips. There are no unscientific "sound quality improvement" claims, with all specifications changes having objective basis. Design also prioritizes electrical performance, pursuing functional beauty. High pricing is also based on rational reasons including unique technology development costs and small-scale production.

## Advice

Chord Electronics suits serious audio enthusiasts seeking the highest level of digital audio reproduction. Their technical superiority is particularly evident in high-resolution audio playback. When considering purchase, it's important to consider overall system balance and combine with high-end amplifiers and speakers that can maximize their DAC performance. While pricing is extremely high, those valuing technical uniqueness and rarity can find value. Not recommended for beginners or budget-conscious buyers; it's advisable to first gain experience with other manufacturers' high cost-performance products before considering these as an ultimate goal. Pre-purchase auditioning is essential to confirm suitability for your musical preferences and usage environment. For long-term use, consider future upgrade paths and support systems in your selection.

## Additional Information

Chord Electronics has recently expanded into portable DAC/amplifier products, offering mobile products like Mojo and Hugo. These products are positioned as entry-level options to experience the company's technology at more accessible prices. They're also developing products with integrated streaming functionality, expanding their product lineup to accommodate modern digital music environments.
