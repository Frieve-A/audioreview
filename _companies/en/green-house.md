## Overview

GREEN HOUSE is a Tokyo-based electronics manufacturer founded in 1991, operating as a fabless company across multiple product categories including audio equipment. The company emphasizes innovation with their tagline "CONTINUE THE CHALLENGE FOR YOUR 'SMILE' AND 'HAPPINESS'" and maintains ISO 9001, 27001, and 14001 certifications [1]. Their audio portfolio includes Bluetooth earphones and headsets, with representative products being the GH-TWSX wireless earbuds featuring Bluetooth 5.2 and aptX codec support, and the GH-BHHSB headset series utilizing older Bluetooth 3.0 technology. The company handles product development from planning through delivery in-house, focusing on functionality-driven design rather than subjective audio philosophies.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be comprehensively evaluated due to insufficient measurement data from credible third-party sources. Available manufacturer specifications show the GH-TWSX supports modern audio codecs including aptX [2], while the GH-BHHSB operates with basic Bluetooth 3.0 profiles [3]. The aptX codec theoretically provides full frequency range coverage from 20Hz-20kHz according to Qualcomm's specifications [4], though GREEN HOUSE does not publish frequency response measurements for their implementation. Critical audio performance metrics such as THD, S/N ratio, intermodulation distortion, crosstalk, and dynamic range are not publicly available from independent measurement laboratories. The presence of aptX codec suggests potential for improved wireless audio quality compared to standard SBC compression, but without independent verification of actual performance against transparent level criteria, the evaluation defaults to 0.5 per framework guidelines for products lacking sufficient measurement data. Independent measurement data will be incorporated when available to provide more definitive scientific validity assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Technology implementation represents competent but unremarkable engineering. The GH-TWSX demonstrates modern connectivity with Bluetooth 5.2 and multi-codec support (SBC/AAC/aptX), showing appropriate adoption of contemporary wireless standards. However, no proprietary patent technology or significant technical innovations are evident in their wireless audio implementations. The progression from GH-BHHSB's outdated Bluetooth 3.0 to GH-TWSX's modern 5.2 standard indicates reasonable technology updating, though competitive advantages are minimal given widespread availability of similar implementations across the industry. Design ownership appears in-house rather than OEM-based, but the technology choices represent standard industry practices without distinctive technical differentiation that competitors would particularly desire to adopt.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

Cost-performance evaluation examines GREEN HOUSE's representative audio products across their portfolio. The current flagship GH-TWSX wireless earbuds, priced at approximately USD 28 [5], provide comprehensive functionality including Bluetooth 5.2, aptX codec support, IPX5 water resistance, and 15-hour total battery life.

Systematic investigation involved searching for competing wireless earbuds using specific functional criteria rather than product names or brands: Bluetooth 5.x connectivity, aptX codec support, IPX5+ water resistance, and 15+ hour battery life. Multiple products were evaluated during this search process. The TREBLAB X3-PRO at USD 40+ offers Bluetooth 5.3 and IPX5 rating but lacks aptX codec support, making it functionally inferior despite higher battery performance. The TREBLAB X8 at USD 40 provides Bluetooth 5.4 and IPX5 water resistance with up to 10 hours per earbud and 40 hours total with case, but lacks aptX codec support which is essential for equivalent audio quality functionality. The Edifier TWS5 includes Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX and IPX5 protection but pricing exceeds USD 50, making it more expensive than the review target. Other budget alternatives either compromise on codec capabilities (lacking aptX support) or water resistance ratings (below IPX5 standard), failing to meet equivalent-or-better functionality requirements.

Equipped with Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, aptX codec support, and IPX5 water resistance rating, the GH-TWSX provides equivalent-or-better functionality compared to alternatives, with audio codec performance and connectivity standards matching or exceeding comparison targets. No competing products were identified offering the same functional combination at lower prices than USD 28.

CP = USD 28 ÷ USD 28 = 1.0

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Reliability and support infrastructure presents significant limitations. WARRANTY coverage is restricted to 6 months for the GH-TWSX [6], which is short compared to brands offering 1-year warranties. Note that within the EU, legal guarantee requires a minimum of 2 years. Support services operate exclusively within Japan with phone assistance available Monday-Friday 10:00-17:00 and 24-hour email acceptance [7], but explicitly state "warranty is valid only in JAPAN" [6]. The company maintains ISO certifications suggesting systematic quality management, and offers specialized services like data recovery within the first year. However, the abbreviated warranty period, geographically limited support infrastructure, and absence of international coverage significantly compromise long-term reliability assurance for global users, particularly given the inherent vulnerability of wireless earphones to moisture damage and battery degradation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Design philosophy demonstrates scientifically sound approaches focused on functional improvements and user benefits. The company's emphasis on measurement-based quality management through ISO certifications and systematic "Plan · Do · Check · Action" methodology [8] indicates rational development processes. Technology progression from older Bluetooth 3.0 implementations to modern 5.2 standards with aptX codec support shows commitment to measurable performance advancement rather than subjective audio mysticism. Cost allocation appears appropriate, with investments in connectivity improvements, water resistance, and battery life directly contributing to user-facing functionality. The absence of occult audio claims or expensive analog fetishization in their wireless product lineup suggests pragmatic engineering focused on achieving transparent wireless audio transmission through established digital standards and codec implementations.

## Advice

GREEN HOUSE products suit budget-conscious consumers seeking modern wireless audio features without premium pricing. The GH-TWSX earbuds offer competitive functionality for users prioritizing aptX codec support and water resistance within limited budgets. However, the 6-month warranty and Japan-only support make these products unsuitable for international users requiring long-term service coverage. Domestic Japanese consumers benefit most from the cost-performance advantages, while global buyers should consider alternatives with broader warranty coverage despite higher prices. The company's rational approach to wireless audio technology makes their products appropriate for users seeking functional improvements over subjective audio philosophies, though the abbreviated support infrastructure limits their appeal for mission-critical applications.
