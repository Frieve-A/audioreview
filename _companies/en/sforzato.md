## Overview

SFORZATO is a Japanese high-end audio manufacturer established in September 2009 by engineer and music enthusiast Kyoichi Omata. Founded with the purpose of music playback through network audio devices, the company specializes in network players, DACs, and master clocks. All products are manufactured domestically in Japan and feature handcrafted customization using SQ-selected components. The company has developed proprietary DIRETTA protocol and ZERO LINK technology, aiming for technological innovation in the high-end network audio field.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Major products like DSP-030EX2 and DSP-010EX2 use ESS 9038 Pro chips and achieve native support for PCM 768kHz and DSD512. The ESS 9038 Pro generally demonstrates good measurement performance as a DAC chip, with typical THD+N of -122dB and SNR of 129dB, but specific measurement data (THD, SNR, frequency response) for the company's products are not publicly available. In the network player product category, sound quality degradation in the digital transmission section is theoretically minimal, making DAC section performance the primary evaluation factor. The company claims proprietary FPGA implementation for ESS control, but whether this contributes to improved measurement performance is difficult to judge without actual measurement data. Claims about DIRETTA protocol improving audio quality lack independent scientific verification and may be imperceptible.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The proprietary DIRETTA protocol and ZERO LINK technology represent notable technological innovations in the industry. DIRETTA, in particular, as a new protocol aimed at high-quality network transmission, has the potential to overcome the constraints of conventional Ethernet-based systems. The DSP-010EX2 features 7 independent power transformers and 21 independent power lines with a 17kg external linear power supply, showing commitment in design philosophy. FPGA-based control of ESS DAC chips also demonstrates a higher technical level than typical implementations. However, verification is needed regarding how much these technologies actually contribute to measured sound quality values, as independent tests show limited evidence of audible benefits.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Against the market price of approximately 1,500,000 JPY (about 10,000 USD) for DSP-030EX2, the WiiM Pro Plus with equivalent functionality is available for 34,380 JPY (about 229 USD). The WiiM Pro Plus features AKM 4493SEQ and achieves excellent measurement performance with 120dB SNR and -110dB THD. Calculation: 34,380 JPY รท 1,500,000 JPY = 0.023, which rounds to 0.0. Basic functions as a network streamer (Roon Ready, MQA, TIDAL/Qobuz support) are completely covered by WiiM Pro Plus, and even lower-cost Raspberry Pi + Volumio configurations can be realized for around 15,000 JPY (about 100 USD). No performance difference sufficient to justify the dedicated device's existence has been confirmed through measurements.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As a Japanese domestic manufacturer with a track record since its 2009 establishment, the company has expanded internationally through distributors. Products are manufactured by hand in Japan, providing a certain level of reliability in quality control. However, being an emerging manufacturer, long-term failure rate data and detailed repair system information are unknown. The complex structure typical of high-end equipment raises concerns about maintainability and long-term stability of parts supply. Regarding firmware update support, as a product line adopting proprietary protocols, continuous software development is necessary, but its continuity is a concern given the company's scale. User reviews indicate general satisfaction but lack quantitative data on reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Product development specialized in network audio is modern and rational. The development of proprietary protocols like DIRETTA and ZERO LINK can be evaluated as technological ambition, but their necessity is questionable given that existing Ethernet/USB connections can achieve sufficient sound quality with minimal degradation. Complex power supply design with external linear power supplies can be expected to have physical effects, but the improvement effects that would justify hundreds of thousands of yen in price difference for digital equipment are scientifically dubious, as measurements do not confirm audible differences. Compared to general-purpose equipment (PC + DAC, smartphone + external DAC), the rationality of existing as a dedicated device does not match the price. The non-disclosure of measurement data also contradicts the rational design philosophy of modern times that emphasizes scientific approaches.

## Advice

While SFORZATO's technological ambition and quality as a Japanese-made product can be appreciated, general purchase recommendation is difficult from a cost-performance perspective. Equivalent functionality can be realized with WiiM Pro Plus (34,380 JPY, about 229 USD), and for those seeking further cost reduction, Raspberry Pi + Volumio configurations (around 15,000 JPY, about 100 USD) are also options. When considering SFORZATO products, judgment based on values other than pure measurement performance and cost-performance is necessary, such as pure interest in technology, commitment to Japanese-made products, or expectations for the future potential of proprietary protocols. However, given the lack of independent measurements verifying claims, these expectations may not translate to audible improvements. If the purpose is building a practical music playback environment, we recommend first verifying effects with low-cost alternatives through blind tests and measurements. Before purchasing high-end network players, always request measurement data and conduct scientifically-based comparative studies.
