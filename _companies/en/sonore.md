## Overview

Sonore, operating under Small Green Computer from New Hampshire, specializes in purpose-built network audio streamers designed to replace standard computer-based audio systems. The company manufactures the Rendu series including microRendu (USD 640), ultraRendu Plus, and opticalRendu Deluxe, targeting audiophile applications with Ethernet input and USB audio output configurations. Sonore appears on Roon's official partners page [4]. Founded with the philosophy that standard computers introduce noise through hard drives, clocks, and power supplies, Sonore positions their products as optimized alternatives for digital audio streaming.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Independent measurements by Audio Science Review of the microRendu v1.4 revealed concerning results. Testing showed that "lowest possible noise floor was not attained with this product" and "no noise was reduced over the mass market computer parts" when compared to standard computer USB outputs [1]. The claimed benefits of purpose-built audiophile design could not be verified through objective measurement. All Rendu products support PCM up to 768kHz and DSD512, meeting technical specifications for high-resolution audio transport [5]. However, the core value proposition of measurably improved audio quality over standard computer-based solutions remains unsubstantiated by third-party testing.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sonore employs competent engineering approaches including dedicated USB circuits, low-noise clock buffers, and optimized power regulation designs. The opticalRendu Deluxe features optical Ethernet isolation and the v1.5 microRendu incorporates improved power converters and clock buffering from higher-end models. Products utilize custom PCBs with minimal component count and specialized circuit topologies. While the engineering is solid for embedded Linux streaming devices, the fundamental approach lacks breakthrough innovation beyond standard ARM-based computer implementations with USB audio interfaces.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

 Cost-performance is weak against finished products offering equivalent functions. The microRendu at USD 640 provides Ethernet-to-USB RAAT endpoint functionality that is available from the iFi ZEN Stream, a finished, Roon Ready, USB-audio network transport priced at USD 399 [2][3]. Calculation: 399 ÷ 640 = 0.623 → 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sonore demonstrates solid reliability track record with established warranty coverage and technical support through Small Green Computer. The company maintains active firmware updates for Linux-based products and provides comprehensive documentation. Manufacturing in New Hampshire suggests quality control oversight, and the established user community indicates reasonable product longevity. No widespread reliability issues appear in user reports, though some users experienced firmware update complications during ASR testing.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design philosophy focusing on noise reduction and optimized USB audio output represents rational engineering objectives. Minimizing computer-generated interference through dedicated hardware approaches aligns with scientific audio principles. However, the emphasis on "purpose-built audiophile" marketing without demonstrated measurable improvements over standard solutions reduces rationality scores. The high pricing for functionality achievable through general-purpose computing platforms suggests limited cost optimization rationale, particularly given equivalent performance from significantly less expensive alternatives.

## Advice

Consider iFi ZEN Stream as a cost-effective finished alternative: Roon Ready, USB audio out, at USD 399 [2][3] versus USD 640+ for Sonore products. If pursuing Sonore products, demand independent measurements demonstrating audio improvements over standard computer USB outputs before purchase. The optical isolation features of higher-end models may appeal to users requiring galvanic separation; evaluate whether standard fiber media converters achieve equivalent isolation at lower cost.
