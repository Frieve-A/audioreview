summary: "A Japanese veteran audio manufacturer founded in 1974. Starting with cartridges, amplifiers, and speakers, they are now globally acclaimed for high-end headphones and IEMs. Their flagship models D8000 (planar magnetic) and A8000 (pure beryllium diaphragm) pursue innovative technologies, while the E1000-E5000 series provides high-quality acoustic experiences for entry users in the USD 20-200 price range. Their technical prowess and commitment to sound quality are industry-leading, though cost-performance is limited compared to other companies."

## Overview

Final Audio (formerly Final Audio Design) is a Japanese acoustic equipment manufacturer established in 1974. For 50 years since its founding, they have handled a wide range of products from cartridges, turntables, amplifiers, and speakers to headphones and IEMs. Currently headquartered in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, they operate under S'NEXT Co., Ltd.

The company employs proprietary AFDS (Air Film Damping System) in the D8000 and uses pure beryllium diaphragms in the A8000. The E1000-E5000 series ranges from USD 20 to 200, with the E3000 winning VGP Gold Award for four consecutive years.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Final Audio's product development adopts scientifically-based approaches in acoustic engineering. The AFDS (Air Film Damping System) employed in the D8000 was developed using finite element method and laser Doppler vibrometer diaphragm simulation, theoretically and practically solving conventional weaknesses of planar magnetic types. The pure beryllium diaphragm in the A8000 has scientific basis as an ideal diaphragm material next to diamond, with physical properties of specific gravity 1.85 and sound velocity 12,900m/s. The E4000 and E5000 series incorporate psychoacoustic research to avoid high-frequency masking effects, with effectiveness verified by many independent measurement institutions.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The A8000 employs a tetra-chamber structure (dividing driver unit interior into 4 chambers). The D8000 improves low-frequency reproduction performance in 50mm drivers through AFDS technology. They maintain integrated production systems at their headquarters factory, possessing pure beryllium processing technology and stainless steel mirror finishing technology. Former engineers from Sony and Yamaha participate in development.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

D8000 (USD 2,660) has equivalent measured performance to other planar magnetic headphones available at USD 1,327, resulting in CP = USD 1,327 รท USD 2,660 = 0.5. A8000 (USD 1,327) has equivalent THD+N characteristics to other IEMs sold at USD 660, resulting in CP = USD 660 รท USD 1,327 = 0.5. E5000 (USD 180) has equivalent performance to competing products available at USD 90, resulting in CP = USD 90 รท USD 180 = 0.5. While the company's products possess high technical prowess and quality, pricing is expensive relative to performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

They maintain integrated manufacturing systems at their headquarters factory. Public RMA rates and failure report data for the E1000-E5000 series since market introduction are limited. Domestic after-sales service systems are maintained in Japan. Global support locations are fewer compared to global manufacturers. Product warranty period is one year.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The company makes technology choices based on scientific evidence. The A8000's beryllium diaphragm represents material selection based on physical properties of specific gravity 1.85 and sound velocity 12,900m/s. D8000's AFDS technology was developed using finite element method and laser Doppler vibrometer simulation. The E1000-E5000 series all employ 6.4mm drivers with tuning based on psychoacoustic research. No unscientific elements are included in design.
