## Overview

Audio Design is a Japanese audio equipment manufacturer with over 21 years of history. The company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells stereo preamps, power amps, selectors, DACs, and headphone amplifiers in-house. Their products are handcrafted by skilled artisans, and in 2017, they achieved 3rd place in the under-1-million-yen category of Stereo Sound magazine's Best Buy Component preamp division, earning industry recognition. They sell through their direct sales site as well as specialized audio retail stores.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company's measurement performance is extremely excellent. The DCP-240 preamp achieves a distortion rate of 0.00063% at 2V output, while the DCHP-200 headphone amplifier shows outstanding THD of 0.0005% across the full frequency range. These values significantly exceed the transparent level (0.01% or below) in the measurement results reference table and provide sufficient effects within human auditory thresholds. Dynamic range improvements and circuit designs using paired FETs also contribute to measurable improvements, confirming scientifically-based sound quality enhancement.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Technical innovations such as full-balanced design adopting amp-in-first configuration and use of paired FETs throughout the circuit can be observed. Particularly, the DCP-240 employs a design that improves dynamic range by 20dB compared to conventional configurations, contributing to measurement performance improvements. However, these technologies are not revolutionary by industry standards and remain within the technical level achievable by other companies. While differentiation through in-house design is achieved, technical uniqueness and advancement remain at a moderate evaluation level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Cost-performance receives a low evaluation. The DCP-240's price is 550,000 yen, but the Topping PRE90 (90,000 yen) exists in the market with equivalent preamp functionality and measurement performance when paired with the dedicated "Ext90" input extender (35,000 yen). The calculation result of 125,000 yen รท 550,000 yen = 0.227 indicates that the same functionality and performance can be obtained at about 1/4.4th the price. The Topping PRE90 has excellent measurement performance with THD 0.0003% and dynamic range 141dB, providing equivalent or superior preamp functionality to the DCP-240, making it difficult to find advantages justifying the price difference.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

There is a track record of continuing business for over 21 years, with high reliability as a Japanese company. Having an in-house design and manufacturing system establishes clear responsibility for products, and handling by specialized audio retail stores demonstrates trust in quality. However, as a small-scale enterprise, there are limitations compared to major manufacturers regarding support system scale and future parts supply guarantees, leaving some uncertainties. While above industry average standards, it does not reach the highest level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The pursuit of measurable performance improvements is scientific and rational. The achievement of improvements in objective indicators such as THD reduction and dynamic range enhancement is commendable. However, in the current situation where equivalent measurement performance can be realized with significantly cheaper products, the necessity of existing as expensive dedicated audio equipment is questionable. With advances in general-purpose technology causing traditional high-end audio equipment to lose its advantages, the rationality of design philosophy is limited in its inability to provide value commensurate with price.

## Advice

While Audio Design products are certainly excellent in measurement performance, recommending them as realistic choices is difficult. If purchasing a preamp with equivalent functionality for the 550,000 yen price of their products, we strongly recommend purchasing the 90,000 yen Topping PRE90 with the 35,000 yen Ext90 and investing the remaining funds in more effective applications (speakers, room acoustic improvements, etc.). Even if you find value in the peace of mind of Japanese manufacturing or handcrafted production, carefully consider whether that value corresponds to a 4.4-fold price difference. For objective sound quality improvement purposes, choosing cost-performance superior alternatives is rational.
