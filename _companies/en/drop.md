summary: "Under Corsair, Drop continues long-running community co-developed staples (HD 6XX, PC38X) while also releasing experimental designs like OAE1. Measurements are generally solid; pace of execution is good, pricing power is average, and support/warranty are about average."

## Overview

Drop began in 2012 as a community-driven co-development platform and became a Corsair brand in 2023[1]. In audio it partners with Sennheiser/EPOS and Axel Grell, maintaining staples like the HD 6XX and PC38X while attempting novel designs such as the OAE1. This review synthesizes current third-party measurements and market pricing to assess the company’s overall tendencies.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Flagship measurements are mostly competent. The HD 6XX shows good frequency-response consistency and channel match[5]. The PC38X, an open-back wired headset with a boom mic, delivers stable imaging and speech capture[11]. The OAE1’s driver-forward layout broadens stage but third-party data reports an impedance peak near ~5.5 kHz and placement/leakage sensitivity, which can interact with high-output-impedance sources[14]. Net: measurement-first and reliable overall, with notable exceptions.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Rather than pure in-house R&D, Drop efficiently productizes high-quality external design assets (Sennheiser lineage, Axel Grell’s know-how). Integration under Corsair has improved scale and logistics[1][2]. With OAE1-class experiments (forward driver placement, highly open mesh), originality and implementation are above industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For a **company-level** score we compute a **weighted average** across three representative models (weights by market presence: HD 6XX=0.5, PC38X=0.3, OAE1=0.2), each compared to the **single cheapest** equal-or-better alternative in user functions and measured performance.

- **HD 6XX (199 USD)** → comparator **HiFiMAN HE400se (109 USD)**; both are open-back, wired; third-party data shows comparable FR/THD ranges[6][7]. **Calc:** 109 ÷ 199 = **0.547… → 0.5**.  
- **PC38X (199 USD)** → comparator **Logitech G PRO X wired (99.99 USD)**; both wired with boom mic; mic quality comparable; closed-back Logitech has superior passive isolation[11][12]. **Calc:** 99.99 ÷ 199 = **0.502… → 0.5**.  
- **OAE1 (299 USD)** → comparator **HE400se (109 USD)**; open-back wired with strong measurement consistency[6][7]. **Calc:** 109 ÷ 299 = **0.364… → 0.4**.

**Weighted result:** 0.5×0.547 + 0.3×0.502 + 0.2×0.364 = **0.497… → 0.5** (rounded to one decimal as required).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Drop states a **30-day** return window for new, unused items[3] and offers an optional extended warranty program[2]. HD 6XX/PC38X pages indicate **2-year** manufacturer warranty[4][10]. Support channels benefit from Corsair scale, yet cross-partner variance and limited long-horizon failure data keep this at an average 0.5.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Marketing claims are restrained; the lineup emphasizes measurable deliverables (open-back voicing, wired stability, mic intelligibility) over audiophile myths. Experimental pieces like OAE1 may split opinions, but with known caveats they can be operated sensibly; overall approach is pragmatic with some risk-taking.

## Advice

For a neutral-leaning open-back at a fair price, **HD 6XX (199 USD)** remains dependable[4][5]. For gaming, **PC38X (199 USD)** stands out for imaging and mic quality[10][11]. To try a **front-staged** presentation, **OAE1 (299 USD)** is interesting, but avoid high-output-impedance amps (e.g., some OTLs) to reduce interactions[14]. Always verify return policy and warranty terms before purchase[2][3].
