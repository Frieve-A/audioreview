## Overview

ND Audio is an emerging IEM manufacturer with an R&D team engaged in direct e-commerce for 10 years, specializing in dynamic driver development at affordable prices. The company's flagship product is the Planet, featuring 12mm beryllium-plated dynamic drivers with refined Harman Curve tuning and planetary-inspired transparent resin cavity design.

The Planet is priced at approximately USD 18, positioning it in the budget IEM market segment. The company distributes primarily through various online retailers including Headphone Zone, The Audio Store, and other regional distributors, emphasizing accessible pricing and beryllium-plated driver technology with claimed 20% performance improvements.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

ND Audio Planet lacks critical measured performance data required for proper scientific evaluation. Available manufacturer specifications include only basic parameters (impedance 32Ω, sensitivity 112dB, frequency range 20-40kHz) without essential audio quality metrics such as harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, frequency response deviation measurements, or passive sound isolation data.

The claimed frequency response range of 20-40kHz is broader than standard 20-20kHz but lacks the crucial ±dB deviation measurements needed to assess actual performance quality. Without third-party measurements or comprehensive manufacturer specifications for audio-quality-relevant parameters, Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated beyond the baseline score mandated for insufficient data scenarios.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The Planet employs 12mm beryllium-plated dynamic drivers with dual-magnetic, dual-cavity design and claims refined Harman Curve tuning. While beryllium-plated drivers represent established technology with known performance characteristics, this implementation appears to use mature technology without cutting-edge innovation.

The design includes standard features such as detachable 2-pin cables with gold-plated connectors and ergonomic lightweight construction. However, no evidence exists of proprietary patent technology, advanced digital integration, or competitive advantages that would be difficult for competitors to replicate. The technology integration remains purely analog/mechanical without DSP or modern signal processing capabilities that characterize contemporary high-end audio products.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations.

The ND Planet at USD 18 demonstrates excellent cost-performance when compared to equivalent products. The Moondrop Chu II at USD 20 provides equivalent-or-better functionality with dynamic driver, detachable cable, metal construction, and verified frequency response measurements. As the Planet is priced lower than the cheapest equivalent alternative identified, no cheaper product with equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance exists in current market analysis.

CP = MIN(1.0, 20 ÷ 18) = 1.0

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

ND Audio provides 1-year warranty on IEM products and 3-month warranty on cables through authorized distributors like Linsoul Audio, which falls below the industry average of 2 years. Support infrastructure operates primarily through dealer-based networks rather than direct manufacturer engagement.

The company's 10 years of e-commerce experience provides some operational foundation, but limited track record exists in the audio industry for reliability assessment. Current availability issues with some retailers indicating out-of-stock status suggest potential supply chain challenges. Construction appears standard for IEM products without exceptional robustness claims or specialized support systems.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

ND Audio's design philosophy demonstrates mixed rationality in cost-effectiveness and scientific approach. While claiming Harman Curve tuning (measurement-based approach), the USD 18 pricing shows reasonable cost optimization for a beryllium-plated driver implementation, though lacking comprehensive measurement validation.

The emphasis on "Planetary Design & Craftsmanship" and beryllium performance claims require measurement evidence for scientific validation. The pricing appears reasonable for the claimed technology level, though the conservative analog approach without advanced DSP integration or cutting-edge features limits potential for meaningful performance improvements. The focus on accessible pricing with beryllium technology shows some cost-effectiveness rationality.

## Advice

ND Audio Planet represents a reasonable value proposition for budget-conscious audio purchasers seeking accessible pricing in the beryllium driver segment. The USD 18 pricing provides entry-level access to beryllium-plated driver technology, though with limited measured performance verification.

**For Budget-Conscious Users**: The Planet offers competitive pricing in the sub-USD 20 segment, but consider the Moondrop Chu II (USD 20) for verified performance measurements and superior build quality documentation.

**For Measurement-Focused Buyers**: Consider alternatives with comprehensive third-party measurements such as the 7Hz Salnotes Zero series or Truthear GATe, which provide detailed performance verification at similar pricing.

The Planet demonstrates how accessible pricing can provide beryllium driver technology to budget market segments, though measurement transparency remains limited compared to established budget competitors.
