## Overview

SOUNDPEATS is a wireless earphone specialist manufacturer founded in 2010 and headquartered in Shenzhen, China. With "Sound for Urban Sports" as their brand concept, they have continued cost-performance focused product development for approximately 15 years. Full-scale global market expansion began in 2013, with parent company Shenzhen Yinke Information Technology Co., Ltd. achieving over 4 billion JPY in annual sales and exporting products to 30 countries worldwide. A Japanese subsidiary, SOUNDPEATS Co., Ltd., has been established to strengthen Asian market expansion.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The flagship Air3 Pro achieves approximately 35dB maximum noise reduction performance, which is competitive for wireless earphones under 50 USD. Measurement data shows that mid-range resolution is maintained, with auditory transparency within acceptable ranges. The H2 model adopts a BA+DD hybrid configuration, and crossover technology implementation shows confirmed measurement improvements. In terms of frequency response flatness and distortion rates, it demonstrates advantages in the audible range compared to similarly priced products.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Technical approaches are evident including proprietary crossover technology, coaxial dual dynamic drivers (Engine 4), and BA+DD hybrid configuration (H2). However, these technologies are combinations of existing design methodologies with reasonable implementation standards. The adoption of Qualcomm QCC3046 chips and aptX Lossless support provides latest codec compatibility, representing appropriate utilization of chipset manufacturer technology. Measurement performance maintains competitive levels in THD+N, IMD, SNR values compared to similarly priced products.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

As a product with equivalent or superior functionality to Air3 Pro (5,890 JPY), the QCY MeloBuds Pro (5,583 JPY) exists. The QCY product offers superior 46dB ANC performance (exceeding Air3 Pro's 35dB), LDAC support for hi-res audio, and similar connectivity, providing completely equivalent or superior function and performance from a user perspective. Calculation: 5,583 JPY ÷ 5,890 JPY = 0.95 → 1.0 (capped). QCY MeloBuds Pro won VGP 2025 Gold Award and has measurement performance advantages, making it a superior choice while being less expensive than Air3 Pro.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

One-year product warranty and prompt after-service are provided, with actual user experiences confirming responsive support including "new product replacement within 4 days of contact" and "speedy response within 1 week." Free replacement support for failures is implemented, with appropriate responses to typical failure patterns such as unilateral volume reduction occurring around 3 months after purchase. Japanese language support is provided through support@soundpeats.com, with quality control systems established at authorized retailers. Support quality exceeds industry standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While the "Sound for Urban Sports" brand concept shows clear application focus, actual product design shows insufficient efforts toward achieving transparency levels in measurement result standards. Particularly, the 35dB ANC performance is clearly inferior compared to similarly priced competitors (QCY MeloBuds Pro's 46dB), raising questions about technical design decisions. The rationale for adopting "bass-focused sound signature" in product development is unclear regarding whether it contributes to frequency response measurement improvements. While the cost-performance focused product strategy is understandable, design philosophy rationality is limited given the existence of products achieving superior measurement performance at the same price point.

## Advice

SOUNDPEATS can be an option for users who prioritize Japanese market support structure, but for those prioritizing acoustic performance, QCY MeloBuds Pro at the same price point is strongly recommended. Measurement comparisons show QCY products are superior in all aspects: ANC performance (35dB vs 46dB), codec support (no LDAC vs LDAC supported), and VGP award achievement (none vs 2025 Gold Award). The only rational reason to choose SOUNDPEATS is confidence in domestic support structure. There is little necessity to pay equivalent prices for products that are objectively inferior in measurement performance, and with superior alternatives available, recommendation is not possible. Rather than being swayed by brand values like "specialist manufacturer" or "15 years of history," rational choices based on measurement data are important.
