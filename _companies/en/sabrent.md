## Overview

Sabrent is a manufacturer of computer peripherals and accessories, including a line of USB audio adapters and external sound cards. Founded with the mission to make everyday technology more accessible, Sabrent focuses on providing affordable plug-and-play audio connectivity solutions for computers and mobile devices. Their audio product lineup primarily consists of USB audio adapters using C-Media chipsets, targeting consumers who need basic audio connectivity without complex setup requirements.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Many entry-level Sabrent adapters (e.g., AU-MMSA USB-A) are commonly based on C-Media’s CM108B, a basic USB audio solution whose **supported sampling rates are 44.1/48 kHz** with 16-bit conversion; public third-party measurements for Sabrent’s own adapters are not available. Sabrent’s newer AU-UCMA (USB-C) **claims** 16/24-bit operation up to **96 kHz** on the official product page, but again lacks independent lab data. Given the absence of verified THD+N/SINAD/SNR measurements for Sabrent units themselves, we default to a provisional mid value and adjust slightly downward to **0.4** pending independent testing.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Sabrent employs mature, commodity USB audio chipsets (e.g., CM108B) without proprietary processing. **Most entry-level designs are limited to 44.1/48 kHz**, while select models (e.g., AU-UCMA) **advertise** up to 96 kHz. Products generally omit advanced features like DSP suites or software integration and prioritize low-cost, replicable reference designs over original audio IP.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Sabrent USB audio adapters are typically around **12 USD** for basic models, versus the **Apple USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter at 9 USD**. The Apple unit provides equivalent functionality with **measured** performance widely documented in objective testing (e.g., **~0.9 Ω output impedance, ~98–100 dB SINAD**), which exceeds expectations for this price tier. Cost-performance calculation: **9 ÷ 12 = 0.75 → 0.7** (rounded).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sabrent offers **1-year** standard warranty (often **extendable to 2–5 years** with timely registration, depending on product). The company provides RMA support and states **replacement with transportation prepaid** for qualifying warranty returns. Simple hardware and few moving parts aid reliability; however, support experiences vary by user report.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Sabrent prioritizes straightforward, low-cost connectivity over innovation. The approach is rational for budget users needing simple I/O, but it does not advance measurement-focused performance or software features.

## Advice

For basic USB audio I/O on a tight budget, Sabrent is serviceable. If you value **measured** audio performance per dollar, the Apple USB-C adapter is a stronger baseline; step up to a dedicated USB DAC if you need higher power or features.
