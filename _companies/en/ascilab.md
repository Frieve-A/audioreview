## Overview

ASCILAB (Acoustic Science Laboratory) is an emerging speaker manufacturer based in Seoul, South Korea. Founded by Changyeul Park and Jinsung Ko, who have over 20 years of experience in acoustics and audio technology. The company has adopted a measurement-driven design approach by introducing the Klippel NFS (Klippel Near Field Scanner) from its establishment. Currently, they develop bookshelf speakers such as C6B, F6B, and A6B as their main products, achieving acoustic performance that significantly exceeds their price range through proprietary waveguide design and 1.1kHz crossover technology.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

ASCILAB's products achieve excellent acoustic performance through design based on measurement data from Klippel NFS. The C6B speaker achieves a maximum SPL of 99dB and low-frequency reproduction capability down to 50Hz (-3dB), receiving high ratings in objective measurements by independent testing organizations such as ASR (Audio Science Review) and Erin's Audio Corner. The low crossover frequency of 1.1kHz is considered technically challenging for 2-way speakers, and its implementation achieves acoustic characteristics comparable to 3-way speakers. It has been confirmed that performance close to the transparent level in the measurement results criteria table is achieved across multiple indicators.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

ASCILAB utilizes the industry-leading measurement equipment Klippel NFS from the design stage and performs optimization through finite element analysis (FEA). Their proprietary waveguide design is a technical achievement that enables the low 1.1kHz crossover while ensuring uniform high-frequency directivity. The adoption of ultra-high-density MDF (700kg/m³) and internal bracing structure effectively suppresses resonance, while aluminum-ceramic drivers achieve high rigidity and low distortion. These technologies can be evaluated as effective technologies that other companies would desire, but they fall short of a perfect score as they use some off-the-shelf components rather than being entirely in-house designed.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

ASCILAB's flagship product C6B (1100 USD) has been evaluated by independent evaluation agencies as having "performance exceeding products at 5 times the price" and "design elements comparable to the 30,000 GBP KEF Blade." Competitive products with equivalent or superior performance, such as the KEF LS50 Meta (1600 USD), exist, but multiple expert evaluations confirm that ASCILAB demonstrates superior performance. Therefore, the C6B is effectively the world's most affordable product for its level of functionality and measurement performance, earning the highest cost-performance score of 1.0. The F6BS also achieves high acoustic performance at 575 USD, providing irreplaceable value in its price range.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

ASCILAB is an emerging company with limited data on long-term failure rates and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures). The founders' over 20 years of acoustic technology experience and professional background provide a foundation for reliability, but the company's track record is still in the accumulation phase. Product warranty and after-service systems are estimated to be at industry average levels, but detailed information about specific warranty periods and repair systems is limited. Currently, sales through Purité Audio London in the UK have been confirmed, and the geographically limited sales system also affects reliability evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

ASCILAB's design philosophy thoroughly adopts a scientific approach based on measurement data, perfectly aligning with this site's evaluation criteria. The measurement-driven design using Klippel NFS is an extremely rational approach that eliminates subjective evaluation and directly leads to objective performance improvement. The achievement of 1.1kHz crossover is a result of overcoming technical difficulties through scientific methods, contributing to achieving transparent-level sound quality. The provision of price-breaking performance is also a rational strategy that utilizes initial investment in measurement equipment for product performance improvement. The attitude of completely eliminating unscientific claims and subjective sound quality theories, pursuing only measurable performance improvements, can be evaluated as an ideal direction in the audio industry.

## Advice

ASCILAB is a noteworthy emerging manufacturer that achieves acoustic performance far exceeding its price through measurement-driven design. The C6B, in particular, provides acoustic performance at 1100 USD that would traditionally require several times the price, making it a top recommendation for buyers who prioritize objective performance. The F6BS achieves excellent performance at 575 USD, making it suitable for budget-conscious buyers as well. However, being an emerging company, those who prioritize long-term warranties and comprehensive after-sales service are recommended to confirm warranty conditions with sales agents before purchase. In terms of acoustic performance, it is comparable to existing high-priced products, and it can be strongly recommended to all buyers seeking scientifically-based sound quality improvement.
