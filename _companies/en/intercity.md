## Overview

Intercity was a small Japanese audio manufacturer focused on desktop headphone amplifiers, with notable models such as the HD-1L and MBA-1 Platinum Edition. The brand is now defunct and products surface only on the used market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

No public third-party laboratory measurements (THD+N, SNR, frequency response, crosstalk) are available for Intercity amplifiers, so transparent-level performance cannot be confirmed. As a modern transparent baseline for reference, an entry-class desktop amp like JDS Labs Atom Amp+ reaches SINAD 119 dB, SNR > 122 dB, and 1 W @ 32 Ω [1][2]. In the absence of comparable data from Intercity, we start from unknown (0.5) and apply a small penalty for measurement opacity to 0.4.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Intercity’s designs were conventional analog desktop headphone amplifiers of their era. We find no evidence of distinctive published patents or peer-reviewed technical papers. Given today’s state of the art, this places the firm below average in originality and recency.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

**Comparator (world’s cheapest equal-or-better):** JDS Labs Atom Amp+ — finished desktop headphone amplifier with pre-out and proven transparent-class performance at **99 USD** [1][2].  
**Representative Intercity price:** HD-1L MSRP **99,800 円** (major headphone show report) [3] ≈ **about 670 USD** for USD-basis scoring.

**Equivalence note:** Same user-facing function (desktop HPA); Atom Amp+ measurements meet transparent thresholds, so it qualifies as equal-or-better [1][2].

**Result:** The company-level CP is poor relative to the comparator, hence **0.1**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The brand no longer operates. Only used-market listings exist; there is no manufacturer support channel, warranty, or parts supply [4][5]. This is effectively the worst case for long-term serviceability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Publicly available material does not substantiate either clearly evidence-based claims or pseudo-scientific ones for Intercity’s designs. With limited verifiable statements from the manufacturer, we assess neutrality at 0.5.

## Advice

Not recommended for practical use. Currently, transparent measured desktop headphone amplifiers with good support are available at low prices (e.g., JDS Labs) [1][2].
