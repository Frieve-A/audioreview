## Overview

RHA (Reid Heath Acoustics) was a British audio company founded in 2011 by Thomas Heath and Andrew Reid, specializing in premium in-ear headphones from Glasgow. The company gained recognition for innovative driver technologies including the world's first commercial in-ear planar magnetic headphones and proprietary DualCoil driver systems. RHA distinguished itself through in-house engineering, handcrafted drivers, and premium materials like stainless steel and zirconium. In June 2021, RHA changed its name to Origin North Ltd, and was subsequently acquired by Sonos in October 2021. The original RHA website was shut down toward the end of 2024, significantly impacting the company's market presence and support infrastructure.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Based on available third-party measurements, RHA products show slightly-above-average scientific validity. The CL2 Planar achieves very low THD in independent testing [1], and the T20 confirms ample basic headroom such as high sensitivity [2]. As typical for earphones/headphones, frequency-response deviations and unit variance remain, so company-wide results do not fully reach transparent level. With multiple models having third-party data (FR, phase, group delay, etc.) [1][2], 0.6 is justified overall.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

RHA demonstrates significant technological innovation and sophistication through proprietary developments. The company pioneered the DualCoil driver technology with frequency-split crossover systems, separating frequencies at 2.2kHz between inner and outer voice coils [3]. RHA achieved the world's first commercial in-ear planar magnetic headphones with the CL2, featuring 10-micrometre-thick drivers in zirconium shells [4]. Additional innovations include Aerophonic design inspired by musical instrument acoustics and in-house handcrafted driver manufacturing. The technology remains competitive and desirable, representing meaningful innovations requiring substantial R&D investment that other manufacturers would likely want to adopt.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

This site compares only user-facing functions and measured performance; driver types/configurations are not considered. For a company-wide CP evaluation, we select representative RHA products and compare them to cheaper alternatives with equivalent-or-better functions and confirmed measured performance. For T20 (~200 USD), the Truthear Hexa (79.99 USD) serves as basis given equivalent measured consistency and practical functions; CP = 79.99 USD ÷ 200 USD = 0.40 [7]. For CL2 Planar (899.95 USD), a current model with widely-shared third-party measurements and equivalent-or-better functions and measured performance, Letshuoer S12 (~150 USD), serves as basis; CP = 150 USD ÷ 899.95 USD = 0.17 [8]. Weighted by market significance across representative products, overall CP rounds to 0.3.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

RHA faces critical reliability and support challenges following corporate restructuring. While the company previously offered above-average 3-year warranties and premium stainless steel construction for durability, current support infrastructure is severely compromised. RHA changed its name to Origin North Ltd in June 2021, was subsequently acquired by Sonos in October 2021, with the official website shut down by late 2024 [5]. Historical customer reports indicate MMCX connector failures and cable durability issues. The uncertain future of warranty support and absence of official channels significantly impact long-term reliability considerations for potential purchasers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

RHA demonstrates highly rational design philosophy with strong engineering focus and substantial R&D investment [5]. The company pursued scientific approaches including measurement-based optimization, published frequency response charts for transparency, and aerophonic design principles inspired by musical instrument acoustics [3]. Innovations like DualCoil technology with 2.2kHz crossover separation and world-first planar magnetic miniaturization represent genuine engineering achievements with clear scientific justification [4][6]. The company emphasized functional design over marketing claims, maintained in-house manufacturing with handcrafted drivers, and invested heavily in research and development. While premium materials added cost, the core focus remained on measurable performance improvements through innovative driver technologies.

## Advice

RHA products should be approached with significant caution due to current market realities. While the technology achievements are noteworthy, particularly the DualCoil and planar magnetic innovations, the cost-performance disadvantage against modern alternatives is substantial. The company's uncertain support structure following corporate changes presents serious long-term ownership risks. Potential purchasers seeking similar performance should consider current-generation alternatives like the Truthear Hexa or other independently-measured options that provide better value propositions. Existing RHA owners should be prepared for limited future support availability and consider backup options for critical use cases.
