## Overview

ALR Jordan was a German speaker manufacturer established in 1989, where founder Karl-Heinz Fink learned metal cone technology from legendary British driver designer E.J. Jordan and adopted aluminum cone drivers across all products. The company offered three series: Entry, Classic, and Note, selling in Japan for approximately 58,000-78,000 JPY. However, the company became effectively defunct after the late 2000s and is now only available through the used market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

ALR Jordan speakers had nominal specifications such as a frequency response of 40-28,000Hz and 90dB sensitivity, but they fall into the problematic level on many metrics by modern standards. While metal cone drivers are theoretically rigid, the resonance control in their designs was insufficient, resulting in THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and frequency response flatness significantly inferior to modern speakers. For instance, current products like the KEF Q350 (approx. 70,000 JPY) and the ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 (approx. 50,000 JPY) achieve a relatively flat frequency response within ±3dB and low distortion below 0.5% in many bands, whereas ALR Jordan's measurement performance does not reach transparency levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design inheriting E.J. Jordan's metal cone technology was advanced for the 1980s but is outdated by current technical standards. The adoption of 24dB crossover networks and Linkwitz-Riley alignments was appropriate for its time, but it is rated as having a low technology level compared to modern DSP control and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) optimization. Compared to competing products that achieve higher performance through contemporary design methods like KEF's Uni-Q drivers or ELAC's concentric drivers, its level is below the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Compared to the ALR Jordan Entry M's original launch price of 78,000 JPY, the superior-performing ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 is available for about 50,000 JPY. The calculation is: `50,000 JPY ÷ 78,000 JPY = 0.641...`, which rounds to a score of 0.6. In terms of pure performance-to-price ratio, its cost-performance cannot be considered high, as superior current products exist at a lower price. The fact that only used items are available due to the company's closure also contributes to its low competitiveness.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

ALR Jordan has been effectively defunct since the late 2000s, and its official website is non-functional. There is no manufacturer support, repair service, or parts supply, making it impossible to address any failures. Naturally, no warranty is provided, placing it at the industry's lowest level for reliability and support. Any operational guarantee on used purchases depends on the seller, and long-term reliability is extremely low.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The approach of a high-rigidity design using metal cone drivers was a rational design philosophy from the perspective of reducing distortion and improving transient response. The acoustic design, based on E.J. Jordan's technology, was a scientific approach aimed at measurable performance improvements, demonstrating a rational direction that avoided occult elements. However, modern design methods can now achieve equivalent performance at a lower cost, diminishing its necessity as a dedicated audio device. While the rationality of the design at the time is commendable, it is outdated in the current technological landscape.

## Advice

Excluding its historical value, ALR Jordan is not a manufacturer that can be recommended for purchase today. With no support available due to the company's closure and availability limited to used items, many superior current products exist in the same price range. For a budget of around 50,000 JPY, the ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 is an excellent choice in all aspects: measurement performance, support, and cost-performance. If the budget can be stretched slightly, the KEF Q350 (approx. 70,000 JPY) also offers scientific validity that far surpasses ALR Jordan. Unless you are specifically seeking it for its vintage audio appeal, choosing from current products is the rational decision.
