## Overview

Cleer is a US-based audio manufacturer established in 2012. The company focuses on wireless headphones and earphones with "Hi-Res Audio certification," featuring proprietary ironless driver technology and industry-leading 100-hour battery life. Main products include the Enduro 100 headphones, Flow II noise-cancelling headphones, ARC 3 open-ear earphones, and the Ally Plus series. Despite being a relatively new manufacturer, Cleer has gained industry recognition with awards from Gizmodo and Rolling Stone.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Cleer's products demonstrate industry-average performance in fundamental audio quality metrics. The Flow II claims THD values at 100dB SPL that are less than half of conventional drivers, but specific numerical data is not publicly available. The ARC 3's frequency response covers a wide range of 50Hz-40kHz with 16.2mm dynamic drivers and DBE (Dynamic Bass Enhancement) 3.0 correction. However, the open-ear design's physical constraints limit absolute low-frequency output. The Enduro 100's 20Hz-40kHz frequency range appears excellent on paper, but lacks verification through measured data, making transparent-level audio quality achievement unconfirmable.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Cleer's technological differentiation factor is its proprietary ironless driver technology. By arranging 20 rare-earth magnets in a ring configuration instead of traditional iron cores, magnetic field concentration is achieved, theoretically reducing distortion. The design philosophy combining this with 40mm magnesium diaphragms for low mass and high rigidity is rational. Additionally, features like the Enduro 100's 100-hour battery life and ARC 3's head tilt control demonstrate considerable technical capability. However, objective verification of how much these technologies actually contribute to audio quality improvement is limited, falling short of industry-leading standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Comparing representative products, the Flow II (199.99USD) competes with the equivalent Sony WH-1000XM4 (278USD), yielding a CP value of 278USD รท 199.99USD = 1.0 (capped at maximum 1.0). The Enduro 100 (159.99USD) compared to the equivalent Sennheiser HD 450BT (74.95USD) yields a CP value of 74.95USD รท 159.99USD = 0.47. For the Ally Plus II (129.99USD), with equivalent ANC and audio quality Beats Studio Buds (99USD), the CP value is 99USD รท 129.99USD = 0.76. Considering these weighted averages, the overall cost-performance yields approximately 0.74, indicating above-average price competitiveness.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Cleer is a relatively young company established in 2012, with limited long-term failure rate data and reliability track record. Product warranty follows industry standard of one year, but detailed information about repair systems and global support networks is not publicly available. For wireless products, firmware update support is provided through the Cleer+ app, but update frequency and support duration are unclear. Considering risks as an emerging manufacturer, reliability and support aspects remain at industry-average levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Cleer's design approach is partially rational. The pursuit of distortion reduction through ironless drivers and extended battery life represents meaningful directions for both audio quality improvement and practicality. Obtaining Hi-Res Audio certification and supporting high-quality codecs like LDAC and aptX Lossless are appropriate approaches. However, challenges exist in the low-frequency enhancement approach for the open-ear ARC 3 design and clarifying the necessity of dedicated audio equipment. While features like the Enduro 100's extended operation are practical, the rationality of dedicated equipment is limited given that equivalent audio quality can be achieved through more affordable smartphone + external DAC combinations.

## Advice

While Cleer's approach to balancing technological uniqueness and practicality is commendable, scientific superiority in audio quality is limited. For cost-performance-oriented users, equivalent competing products often represent more rational choices. The 100-hour battery Enduro 100 has value for specific needs (use in environments with limited charging opportunities), but may be considered over-specification for general use environments. When considering purchase, we recommend weighing specific needs for unique features against price differences. Long-term support risks as products from an emerging manufacturer should also be considered.
