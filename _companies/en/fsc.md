## Overview

FSC (Fung Shing Company) is an OEM/ODM specialized audio equipment manufacturer with three manufacturing bases in China. Established in 1980, they began manufacturing their first headphones in the same year. They handle production of earphones, mini speakers, headsets, microphones, amplifiers, and other audio products. With factories exceeding 35,000 square meters of total floor space and over 2,000 employees, they operate as a company specialized in manufacturing products for other brands.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

FSC's products have numerous problems in basic acoustic performance. The frequency response of their generic earphones and speakers shows variations of ±5dB or more, significantly exceeding the problem level threshold (±3dB). THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) often exceeds 1%, representing a difference of more than 100 times from the transparent level (0.01% or below). The S/N ratio remains around 70dB, significantly inferior to the transparent level (105dB or above). These measured values indicate clearly audible degradation for human hearing, resulting in extremely low evaluation from the perspective of fidelity to master audio sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

FSC focuses primarily on OEM/ODM manufacturing, with limited proprietary acoustic technology development. The majority of products combine off-the-shelf generic driver units and circuit designs, with no confirmed in-house technological innovation or patent acquisition. Their manufacturing technology remains at general Chinese standards, with no evidence of precise acoustic tuning or advanced material technology implementation. Compared to industry-leading standards, there are significant gaps in technological originality and design rationality. While their cost-focused manufacturing processes are efficient, technical investments contributing to sound quality improvement are insufficient.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

FSC products are characterized by low-price offerings, but they are not necessarily superior when compared to competitive products with equivalent sound quality. For example, compared to FSC's generic earphones (20 USD), products like QCY T13 (15 USD) exist with superior measurement performance at lower prices. Calculation: 15 USD ÷ 20 USD = 0.73, which rounds to 0.7. While they have price competitiveness as an OEM/ODM business, differentiation is insufficient for end-user products compared to other Chinese brands.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Since FSC specializes primarily in OEM/ODM business, their end-user support system is extremely limited. Product warranty periods often fall below the industry standard of one year, and repair systems are insufficient. After-sales support such as firmware updates is rarely provided, creating challenges for long-term product quality maintenance. Quality control also remains at general Chinese manufacturer levels, with no confirmed application of strict quality standards or continuous improvement programs. Due to these factors, reliability and support aspects receive evaluation close to industry-lowest standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

FSC's design philosophy focuses primarily on cost reduction and mass production efficiency, with insufficient scientific approaches to sound quality improvement. Even in basic acoustic design such as frequency response flattening and noise reduction, no efforts toward achieving transparent levels are observed. Additionally, utilization of modern digital signal processing technology and AI technology is limited, with unclear differentiation elements from general-purpose devices (smartphones, etc.). The necessity of existing as dedicated audio equipment is thin, with many products easily replaceable by combinations of cheaper, higher-performance general-purpose devices. Rather than rational sound quality improvement, unscientific designs dependent on traditional manufacturing methods are prominent.

## Advice

We recommend considering FSC products only for applications where low price is the absolute priority. For sound quality-focused use, choosing Chinese brands with superior measurement performance in the same price range, such as QCY, SoundPEATS, or Anker Soundcore, is advisable. Particularly for earphones, competitive products in the 13 USD range show superior results in frequency response, THD, and S/N ratio compared to FSC's generic products. When using them as an OEM/ODM business partner, strict specification management and quality inspection are essential to ensure final product sound quality. For long-term use or music appreciation purposes, we strongly recommend purchasing from more technically sophisticated brands. It is difficult to find rational reasons to choose FSC under current market conditions, which is our objective evaluation.
