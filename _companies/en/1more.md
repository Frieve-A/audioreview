## Overview

1MORE is an audio brand founded in 2013 in Shenzhen, China, established by former Foxconn general managers with investment from Xiaomi. The company operates under the philosophy that "music lovers should always hear more," with a mission to provide high-quality headphones at affordable prices. They have achieved recognition for their technical capabilities, including the world's first THX-certified Quad Driver earphones and 12 CES awards. Currently based in San Diego, USA and Shenzhen, China, they offer a wide range of products including Triple Driver series, SonoFlow series, and ComfoBuds series.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

1MORE's flagship Triple Driver In-Ear headphones demonstrate frequency response within 20Hz-40kHz range with THD measurements below 0.1% in mid and high frequencies according to TechRadar and SoundGuys measurement reviews. S/N ratio exceeds 100dB on most models, meeting the policy's transparent level requirements. However, low-frequency distortion characteristics show room for improvement, with some models exhibiting THD values of 0.08-0.12% in bass response below 100Hz, exceeding the 0.05% threshold for headphones. Overall measurement performance provides scientifically valid audible improvements over baseline products.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

1MORE employs a unique triple driver configuration (2 balanced armature + 1 dynamic driver) and has developed the world's first THX-certified earphones, demonstrating technical originality. They actively adopt cutting-edge technologies such as QuietMax ANC technology, LDAC codec support, and hybrid ANC technology. However, measurement data reveals some quirks in frequency characteristics, particularly in low-frequency distortion. While possessing technical levels above industry average, it's more of an effective combination of existing technologies rather than completely original technical innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

1MORE's products offer exceptional cost-performance compared to competitors with equivalent features and performance. In many cases, they are offered at or near the lowest prices in their respective product categories.

- **1MORE SonoFlow (75USD):** As one of the most affordable LDAC/ANC-enabled headphones on the market, it provides core features comparable to more expensive models like the Sony WH-1000XM5 (279USD).
- **1MORE Triple Driver (60USD):** This multi-driver earphone is overwhelmingly low-priced compared to renowned high-fidelity models like the Shure SE535 (494USD).
- **1MORE ComfoBuds Mini (99USD):** As a compact TWS with high-performance ANC, it has a very competitive price point even when compared to higher-end models like the Sony WF-1000XM4 (159USD).

As such, with major products effectively achieving the industry's lowest prices for equivalent functionality, the cost-performance rating is a top-tier 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

1MORE is a relatively new brand founded in 2013, with limited long-term reliability track record. While they provide a standard 1-year warranty, their repair and support systems in Japan are weaker compared to major brands. However, they actively provide firmware updates and are committed to continuous product improvement. Despite achievements such as 12 CES awards, specific reliability data such as failure rates and MTBF are not publicly available, necessitating evaluation at industry average level for support quality.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

1MORE's design philosophy is based on the clear concept of "excellent sound quality at affordable prices," which is fundamentally rational. They adopt technical approaches that contribute to measurable sound quality improvements, such as Triple Driver configuration and THX certification. However, some products feature bass-emphasized tuning, which prioritizes subjective preference over measurement transparency. Additionally, regarding the significance of existence as dedicated audio equipment, the advantage over smartphone high-quality DAC amplifiers in the same price range is not clear for some products. There are aspects of both scientifically-based design and commercial sound tuning, making it not completely rational.

## Advice

1MORE is suitable for users seeking high sound quality on a limited budget. The Triple Driver series in particular offers sound quality equivalent to 533 USD class competitors at 133 USD, making it widely recommendable from beginners to intermediate users. However, for those prioritizing long-term reliability and support systems, established brands like Sony or Sennheiser should be chosen. For those seeking completely flat sound quality, it's strongly recommended to audition before purchase, considering 1MORE's bass-emphasis tendency. For experiencing cutting-edge wireless technology (LDAC, ANC) at low prices, the SonoFlow series is a viable option. Overall, it's an attractive choice for users who prioritize price-performance ratio above all else.
