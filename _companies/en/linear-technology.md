## Overview

Linear Technology Corporation was an American semiconductor manufacturer founded in 1981 by Robert H. Swanson, Jr. and Robert C. Dobkin. For 36 years, it operated independently as a high-performance analog IC specialist, developing excellent audio op-amps such as the LT1115, LT1124, and LT1364. However, in 2017, Analog Devices acquired the company for 14.8 billion USD, and it ceased to exist as an independent entity. Currently, the "Power by Linear" brand name remains on some power management products.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The flagship product LT1115 achieved ultra-low noise performance of 0.9nV/√Hz at 1kHz, which was an industry-leading specification. THD is 0.002% (10kHz, AV = -10, RL = 600Ω), significantly below the 0.01% transparency level. The LT1364 features 70MHz bandwidth and 1000V/µs slew rate, providing more than sufficient performance for audio applications. The LT1124 series also achieved low noise with 2.7nV/√Hz typical, meeting the transparent level.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Ultra-low noise design technology was industry-leading at the time. Achieving the LT1115's 0.9nV/√Hz required advanced circuit design and process technology impossible with simple OEM products. The company also contributed significantly to the engineering community by providing the free LTspice simulator. With over 7,500 product lineup covering data conversion, signal conditioning, and power management with proprietary design technology. However, some technologies are now outdated from current standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Current market pricing of Linear Technology products is expensive compared to equivalent-performance competitors. Taking LT1115 (0.9nV/√Hz) at approximately 20 USD and the cheapest equivalent Analog Devices ADA4898-1 (0.9nV/√Hz) at approximately 2.70 USD, CP = 2.70 USD ÷ 20 USD = 0.135 → rounded to 0.1. Other flagship products similarly face cheaper equivalents post-acquisition.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

During independent operation, the company provided stable quality control and technical support. However, after the 2017 acquisition, no independent Linear Technology support structure exists. Currently integrated into Analog Devices' support system, creating uncertainty about support continuity for former Linear Technology customers. While product reliability maintained high standards, corporate sustainability posed problems.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

There was no rationality in continuing as an independent company. While high-performance analog IC technical value is recognized, the 14.8 billion USD acquisition proves the company could no longer maintain competitiveness independently. Currently, Texas Instruments and Analog Devices itself provide equivalent or superior performance products at lower prices, eliminating Linear Technology's unique value proposition. Post-acquisition, it became merely a brand name without serving as a technology innovation entity.

## Advice

We cannot recommend adopting Linear Technology products for new applications. While the company's technical legacy is appreciable, it no longer exists as an independent entity and products are significantly overpriced compared to competitors. For new designs, we strongly recommend selecting alternatives with equivalent performance at rational prices, such as Texas Instruments' OPA1611/OPA1641 or Analog Devices' AD797/ADA4898-1. For existing systems using Linear Technology products, replacement planning should be considered.
