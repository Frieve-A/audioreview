## Overview

Soundcraft is a British professional audio manufacturer founded in 1973 by Phil Dudderidge and Graham Blyth in London. The company pioneered the touring mixer market with the Series 1, the first flight-case integrated mixing console. Now owned by HARMAN (Samsung), Soundcraft produces analog and digital mixing consoles for live sound, recording, broadcast, and installation. The portfolio spans compact Ui series digital mixers to large-scale Vi series consoles for major touring and installed sound.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Where third-party lab data are scarce for pro consoles, we reference official specifications and clearly label them as manufacturer specs. Vi-series measured specifications (manufacturer) indicate competent transparency: frequency response +0/–1 dB from 20 Hz–20 kHz (stagebox mic in to line out) and THD <0.003% at 1 kHz (min gain). The platform supports 48 kHz or 96 kHz sampling with 40-bit floating-point processing [1]. Ui24R provides standard live-sound DSP (channel dynamics, 31-band GEQ on outputs) and Studer-designed mic preamps [2]. Overall, Soundcraft consoles meet professional norms but do not clearly exceed transparent thresholds versus the best contemporary digital mixers.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Soundcraft’s technology stack is mature and well-integrated. Vi consoles implement 96 kHz / 40-bit float processing, Lexicon FX, dbx processing, and built-in BSS DPR901II dynamic EQ models; the FaderGlow™/Vistonics™ interface is an operationally rational innovation for fast layer navigation [1][6][7]. Ui24R combines browser-based multi-device control (no app), dual-path multitrack recording (USB drive and computer), and Studer-designed preamps in a compact rack format [2]. These are solid, field-proven engineering choices rather than bleeding-edge breakthroughs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

For a representative, current workhorse we use the Ui24R. The lowest stable new US market price is **1,369 USD** (MAP) [3]. The **cheapest equivalent-or-better** alternative is **Behringer X32 Rack with X-LIVE** (adds SD multitrack to match Ui24R’s integrated recording); Sweetwater’s bundle price is **1,170 USD** [4]. Equivalence rationale (user perspective): remote control, multitrack recording, and core mix capacity; X32 Rack also offers higher maximum channel count (40 inputs) with comparable published performance [4][5].  
**Raw calculation (CP<1.0 required to show):** 1,170 USD ÷ 1,369 USD = **0.855…** → rounded to **0.9**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

HARMAN provides global support/warranty with documented firmware upkeep on Ui24R (e.g., v3.x feature updates; downloads show updates through July 2025) [2]. Hardware construction of Vi surfaces and stageboxes is professional-grade, and documentation/firmware for Ui series is comprehensive. Field reports note occasional quirks typical of compact digital ecosystems; overall, support and reliability track at industry-standard levels rather than best-in-class.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The company emphasizes practical, measurement-aligned engineering (transparent signal path, integrated DSP, rational UI like FaderGlow). However, its direction is largely conservative—prioritizing workflow and ecosystem consistency over measurable leaps in noise/distortion versus top performers. Investment tends toward operational robustness rather than pushing audible transparency beyond already-adequate thresholds.

## Advice

Soundcraft remains a sensible choice for live-sound engineers and venues prioritizing dependable workflows and a broad ecosystem. Choose Vi series where tactile control, I/O scale, and integrated BSS/Lexicon/dbx tooling justify the spend. Ui24R is a compact control/recording hub with excellent practical features and competitive cost-performance at current US pricing—though an X32 Rack + X-LIVE bundle undercuts it slightly in price while matching key functions. Evaluate required I/O, recording workflow, and control method (browser vs. app) against local pricing before purchase.
