summary: "Chinese IEM brand with solid measured performance via hybrid/tribrid designs. However, when compared strictly on measured performance alone, cheaper alternatives undercut it, and QC/support consistency remains a concern."

## Overview

Founded in 2019 under Linsoul Audio, ThieAudio focuses on in-ear monitors across Voyager (multi-BA), Legacy (hybrid), and flagship tribrids combining DD + BA + EST. Notable models include **Oracle MKIII (USD 589)** and **Hype 10 (USD 899)**. While they target high performance at accessible prices, consistency in QC and after-sales support warrants attention.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Independent measurements indicate broadly competent performance. **Hype 10** shows **avg. impedance 14.64Ω** and **sensitivity 133.9 dB/V SPL** on RAA, with documented frequency-response shifts versus source output impedance (e.g., ~±2.8 dB at 40 Hz). Public THD datasets remain limited; available evidence suggests performance within practical limits, so we set this at 0.7.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

High-end models employ **IMPACT²** (dual-isobaric bass) and reputable BA suppliers, with four-way crossovers and carefully tuned acoustic bores. Execution is competitive for the segment. Core transducer tech is sourced rather than developed in-house.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Ignoring **driver topology and price class**, we compare strictly on **functionality (e.g., 0.78 mm 2-pin)** and **measured performance** to the **cheapest** product that matches or exceeds those metrics. Among products with **independently verified** target compliance and **low THD**, the cheapest is **TRUTHEAR x Crinacle ZERO: RED (USD 64.99)** with Rtings-measured **THD 0.04% @94 dB / 0.19% @104 dB** and **115.7 dB SPL @1V** sensitivity.

- **Oracle MKIII (USD 589)** → ratio **64.99 ÷ 589 ≈ 0.11**  
- **Hype 10 (USD 899)** → ratio **64.99 ÷ 899 ≈ 0.07**

Average ≈ **0.09**, so this criterion is **0.1** under strict measured-performance comparison.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Linsoul advertises a **1-year warranty**, but user reports cite **slow handling** and **challenging communication** in some cases, alongside sporadic early defects. Prefer retailers with robust return windows and clear domestic support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Assigning DD/BA/EST to LF/mids/treble roles is a rational, measurement-driven partition. Crossover and acoustic path choices align with objective goals, though complexity can increase manufacturing tolerance and reliability risks.

## Advice

If you want **target-aligned tuning** and modern multi-driver tech, ThieAudio can deliver. That said, a **strict measurements-only** comparison finds cheaper options (e.g., ZERO: RED) that meet or exceed key metrics. Mitigate support risk via strong-return retailers and confirm fit/kit requirements in advance.
