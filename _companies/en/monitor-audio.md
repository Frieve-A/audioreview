summary: "A veteran British speaker manufacturer established in 1972. With over 45 years of design experience, they cover a wide range of price points through their Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum series. They have a reputation for proprietary technology development centered on C-CAM (Ceramic-Coated Aluminum Magnesium) technology, with particularly strong competitiveness in the mid-price range. However, publication of measurement data is limited, and cost-performance can be inferior compared to other manufacturers' products in the same price range."

## Overview

Monitor Audio is a speaker manufacturer founded in 1972 in Rayleigh, Essex, England. With over 45 years of design experience and currently employing 100 staff, it is one of the UK's representative Hi-Fi brands. The company advocates a "Transparent Design Philosophy" and pursues "transparent" sound that accurately reproduces the artist's intended sound.

Their product lineup spans from the entry-level Bronze 6G, mid-range Silver 7G, high-end Gold, to the flagship Platinum series. The Bronze 2 (279 pounds) in particular has continued to evolve for approximately 20 years as a standard in the 200-350 pound price range, serving as a benchmark product demonstrating the company's technical capabilities.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Monitor Audio undertakes technical efforts, but published measurement data is limited. The latest Silver 7G series has implemented improvements based on clear technical rationale, including new tweeters and waveguides, and 3-inch neodymium magnet midrange drivers. However, detailed measurement data such as THD+N, frequency response, and impedance characteristics are not published for many products, making scientific verification difficult. The Bronze 100's frequency response (37Hz-28kHz) is good, but the measurement conditions for these figures are unclear.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The company's technical characteristic lies in their proprietary C-CAM (Ceramic-Coated Aluminum Magnesium) technology. This technology achieves lightweight yet highly rigid driver cones, providing excellent high-frequency characteristics particularly when combined with Gold Dome Tweeters. Technical progress can be seen with each generation, including the Bronze 6G series' Uniform Dispersion Waveguide technology and the Silver 7G's improved crossover design. However, revolutionary breakthroughs like KEF's Uni-Q technology are not evident, and technical progress remains incremental.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

While the Bronze 100's price is unclear, the Bronze 2 (279 pounds ≈ USD 399) is in the same price range as the Wharfedale Diamond 12.1 (USD 399). CP = USD 399 ÷ USD 399 = 1.0 can be considered, but when compared to the KEF Q150 (normally USD 550, on sale for USD 350), the CP becomes 350 ÷ 399 = 0.88 when Q150 is on sale. The Diamond 12.1 won the 2024 What Hi-Fi award, indicating fierce competition in this price range. The upper Silver 7G series also has limited price advantages compared to competing products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As a veteran manufacturer with over 50 years of continuous business operation, reliability is high, with a stable management foundation employing 100 staff at the UK headquarters. Product quality has also maintained a certain level of reliability as demonstrated by long-term market evaluation. However, there are concerns about quality impact from manufacturing location changes, such as moving Silver series production to China in 2004. Support systems in the Japanese market provide appropriate support through authorized dealers, but are somewhat inferior compared to other major manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The "Transparent Design Philosophy" is easy to understand, with a clear goal of accurately reproducing the artist's intent. Improvements based on specific technical rationale are also implemented, such as C-CAM technology and Uniform Dispersion Waveguide technology. However, the definition of "transparency" and measurement methods are unclear, and there is no public information on what criteria are used to judge transparency. Additionally, while advocating "harmony with the environment," specific implementation methods and verification data are lacking, making the scientific basis of the design philosophy insufficient.

## Advice

Monitor Audio is suitable for users who want "traditional British sound realized with modern technology." Products in the mid-price range particularly showcase high completion levels that leverage years of development expertise.

- **Beginners seeking British sound**: The Bronze 2 (USD 399) is excellent as an entry-level speaker that realizes traditional British sound crafting with modern technology. Comparison listening with the similarly priced Wharfedale Diamond 12.1 is recommended.
- **Mid-level audiophiles**: The Silver 7G series has significantly improved from the previous 6G series with improved crossover design. Comparison with KEF's Q350 and ELAC's upper models is recommended.
- **Users prioritizing measurement data**: Since published measurement data is limited, those seeking more detailed specifications should consider products from other manufacturers like KEF or Genelec.

It is important to conduct listening tests before purchase to confirm compatibility with your sound preferences and environment.
