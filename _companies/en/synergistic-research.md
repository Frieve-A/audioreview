summary: "An audio company promoting proprietary scientific theories like 'quantum tunneling' and 'UEF technology' while developing extremely high-priced cables and accessories. Most products lack clear evidence of effectiveness from mainstream scientific and engineering perspectives. While supported by users who believe in brand value and subjective sound quality evaluations, the objective performance-to-price ratio is among the lowest in the audio market. Purchase decisions test personal beliefs rather than scientific rationality."

## Overview

Synergistic Research was founded in 1992 by Ted Denney as an American high-end audio company. They manufacture a wide range of products from power cables, interconnects, and speaker cables to unique accessories like fuses, ground blocks, and soundfield adjusters. The company features technologies with proprietary terminology such as "UEF (Uniform Energy Field)," "Active Shielding," and "Quantum Tunneling treatment," with products sold at extremely high prices ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. Their design philosophy diverges from mainstream science and electrical engineering, making their effectiveness a subject of long-standing debate in the audio community.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

There are no peer-reviewed studies or measurement data that have been scientifically verified and reproduced by third parties regarding the claimed effects of the company's "quantum tunneling," "UEF technology," "graphene," and other technologies on audio signals. While subjective reviews by audio critics mention "expanded soundstage" and "improved resolution," these are not based on ABX blind tests that eliminate placebo effects and confirmation bias. For example, the company's fuses selling for hundreds of dollars have been shown through disassembly to have internal structures not significantly different from generic inexpensive fuses, with no objective evidence of physical or electrical superiority justifying their price. Most claimed effects are difficult to explain through known physical laws, and scientific validity cannot be recognized.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The physical construction of products, such as connector quality and exterior finish, is often robust and befitting their high price range. However, the core "technologies" underlying their design mostly lack rationality from scientific and engineering perspectives. For example, "Active Shielding" applies external DC voltage to the shield layer of cables, but the claim that this provides audible improvements to audio signal quality lacks objective measurement data support. From a standard engineering perspective, many technologies appear to be more marketing elements for product differentiation and high-price justification rather than problem-solving solutions. While creative, their deviation from scientific rationality results in extremely low technology level evaluation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Cost-performance is at the lowest conceivable level in the audio market. The astronomical price difference compared to alternatives with equivalent function and performance results in a 0.0 evaluation based on the CP definition formula.

-   **Fuses**: Synergistic Research's "Master Fuse" sells for approximately USD 650 each, while electrically equivalent high-quality fuses from Littelfuse or Bussmann can be purchased for under USD 1. With no objective data proving performance differences, the price difference exceeds 650 times. `CP = 1 ÷ 650 ≈ 0.0015`
-   **Speaker Cables**: The company's speaker cables range from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars (e.g., SRX series at approximately USD 30,000 for 8 feet). Meanwhile, cables like Mogami 3103 or Canare 4S11, which have earned tremendous trust in professional settings, cost around USD 100 for equivalent length. These professional cables have extremely low resistance, capacitance, and inductance with top-tier electrical performance. The claimed sound quality differences are not scientifically proven, with price differences reaching hundreds of times. `CP = 100 ÷ 30,000 ≈ 0.003`

These examples clearly show that product prices are formed by proprietary theories and marketing rather than performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As a company with a long history, they have built dealer networks worldwide. The physical manufacturing quality of products is high, and they are not inferior products that fail immediately. Support systems for warranty and repair exist, and they fulfill certain responsibilities as a high-priced product manufacturer. However, product reliability includes not only physical durability but also consistent delivery of claimed performance. Since the performance itself is based on unscientific claims, performance reliability is nonexistent, but considering the company's support structure and physical robustness of products, this score is given.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy is diametrically opposed to scientific rationality. Claims like "fuse direction changes sound," "stickers made from specific materials improve sound quality," and "quantum processing improves electron flow" are incompatible with modern physics and electrical engineering common sense. These philosophies prioritize subjective "hearing experience" and mystical narratives over objective measurements and universal laws. Product value depends largely on whether one believes in and empathizes with these non-rational narratives. While this approach might be viable if audio is viewed as art or hobby reflecting personal sensibilities and beliefs rather than a product of science and technology, from the "rational perspective" evaluation axis of this review, it must receive extremely low evaluation.

## Advice

When considering purchasing Synergistic Research products, it is crucial to strongly recognize that this is not an investment aimed at performance improvement based on science or engineering. The company's products are best positioned as extremely expensive accessories for enjoying audio in the realm of "hobby" or "art" that pursues personal sensibilities and philosophy.

If you prioritize objective performance, measurement data, and cost-performance, the company's products should be completely excluded from consideration. With the same or minimal investment, you can obtain scientifically proven high-performance products from companies like Mogami, Canare, Topping, and Fosi Audio.

Conversely, if you have significant financial resources and want to explore unconventional ways of enjoying audio or find value in their unique brand story and design, trying them at your own risk is one option. However, you should be prepared that their "effects" are largely due to psychological satisfaction.
