## Overview

Leak is an audio manufacturer established in London, UK in 1934 by Harold Joseph Leak. The company was known for technical innovations, including the development of the world's first sub-0.1% distortion amplifier in 1945. Production ceased in 1979, but the brand was revived in 2020. Currently, they offer the Stereo 130 and 230 integrated amplifiers, CDT CD transport, and Sandwich speaker series. The product lineup combines classic exterior design with modern digital functionality for their market comeback.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Current products achieve measurement performance close to transparent levels. Actual measurements of the Stereo 230 amplifier confirm 80W into 8Ω and 120W into 4Ω when THD+N reaches 1%, exceeding the rated 115W@4Ω specification. THD at 20W output measures 0.0014% (-97dB), meeting transparent-level criteria. The Stereo 130 also achieves 0.005% THD and 108dB S/N ratio, with a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (±0.5dB). ESS 32-bit DAC chips (ES9018K2M/ES9038Q2M) enable high-resolution playback up to DSD256.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design combining modern ESS Sabre DAC chips with Class AB amplification represents a standard industry approach. The Stereo 230's "double parallel" power stage design improves low-impedance load handling, with DC Servo circuits enhancing output quality. A dedicated current feedback circuit for headphone output is also implemented. However, this is essentially a combination of existing technologies without proprietary innovative elements. Unlike the technical breakthrough of achieving 0.1% distortion in 1945, current products show no such innovation and remain at industry-average design levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

There are serious issues with the price-to-performance ratio. The flagship product, the Stereo 230 (1,695 USD), is an integrated unit with an amplifier, multi-input DAC, and phono stage. However, equivalent or superior functionality can be achieved with a combination of more affordable components. For example, combining a Fosi Audio V3 amplifier (approx. 90 USD), an SMSL SU-1 DAC (approx. 80 USD), and a Fosi Audio Box X2 phono preamp (approx. 50 USD) results in a total cost of around 220 USD. This setup covers all the main features of the Stereo 230 and achieves comparable or better measurement performance. The calculation 220 USD ÷ 1,695 USD ≈ 0.13 shows that Leak's product is about 8 times more expensive. It is difficult to rationally justify this price difference with factors other than design or brand name.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As a traditional British brand, it maintains certain reliability standards. Since the 2020 revival, they have gradually expanded their product lineup and established stable supply systems. Continuous coverage in specialist publications like Stereophile has improved market recognition. However, with less than five years since the revival, long-term reliability data is insufficient. Regarding support systems, while they have a global expansion, specific service details for Asian markets remain limited. This represents a standard level for a newly revived brand.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The direction toward achieving transparent-level measurement performance is scientifically rational. They incorporate elements contributing to sound quality improvement, including Class AB amplification, high-performance ESS DACs, and appropriate power supply design. However, given the existence of technical approaches that achieve equivalent performance at a lower cost, they lack proprietary technology or innovation to justify the high pricing. While the vintage design revival concept meets market needs, no technical superiority sufficient to bridge the price gap is evident. Insufficient utilization of modern signal processing technology and cost reduction methods leaves room for improvement in rationality.

## Advice

Leak's current products reach transparent levels in measurement performance with no sound quality issues. However, numerous alternatives provide equivalent functionality at lower prices, making them unsuitable for purely performance-focused purchasing decisions. They merit consideration only for those who value the fusion of vintage British audio design with modern technology and can tolerate the price difference. They particularly suit users who prioritize interior harmony and ownership satisfaction. However, it is important to understand that superior performance combinations are achievable within the same budget. For those prioritizing sound quality, a rational strategy would be to allocate most of the budget to speakers while selecting low-cost, high-performance amplification.
