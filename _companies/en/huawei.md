## Overview

Huawei is a telecommunications equipment manufacturer founded in 1987 and based in Shenzhen, China, which has recently entered the audio field. The flagship FreeBuds series has been developed since 2018, offering a wide lineup from high-end models like FreeBuds Pro, FreeBuds Pro 3, and FreeBuds Pro 4 to the affordable FreeBuds SE series. The company's audio products particularly focus on noise cancellation technology, with active technical initiatives including the proprietary L2HC codec and HiRes Audio certification.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Huawei's audio products achieve measurable improvements in some areas but do not reach transparency levels overall. While third-party measurements indicate challenges in low-frequency reproduction for the FreeBuds Pro 3's frequency response, this can be improved through EQ customization. Noise cancellation performance achieves effective isolation in the 50Hz-2kHz range, showing auditorily meaningful improvements in this field. Although overall acoustic balance has room for improvement in sound quality, the dual-driver configuration achieves wide-band reproduction of 14Hz-48kHz, reaching a certain level of fidelity to master sources.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Huawei demonstrates technical originality with its proprietary L2HC codec (versions 2.03/3.0) achieving 990kbps high bitrate transmission. Technical initiatives such as improved interference resistance through Polar Code technology and enhanced processing capability via the Kirin A2 chip are recognized. The FreeBuds Pro 3 achieves 14Hz-48kHz wide-band reproduction through a dual configuration of 11mm dynamic drivers and micro planar drivers, also obtaining HiRes Audio Wireless certification. These technologies contribute to sound quality improvement and achieve a certain technical standard within the industry, though not reaching the highest levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Using FreeBuds Pro 3 (245 USD) as reference, the Sony WF-1000XM4 with equivalent or superior functionality and performance is currently available for approximately 198 USD. Calculation: 198 USD รท 245 USD = 0.81, which rounds to 0.8. While Sony's price has declined as a previous-generation product, FreeBuds Pro 3 represents current market pricing. The newer Sony WF-1000XM5 (298 USD) offers superior performance across most metrics. Affordable products like FreeBuds SE 2 (49 USD) demonstrate high competitiveness, making the company's overall cost-performance favorable. Compared to Apple AirPods Pro 2 (249 USD), it offers comparable functionality with price advantages.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Huawei leverages its extensive experience as a telecommunications equipment manufacturer to achieve relatively stable quality control. Regular firmware updates for functional improvements are provided, with support systems exceeding industry standards. While international political constraints limit support in some regions, product durability and defect rates maintain acceptable levels compared to competitors. Warranty periods are standard and repair systems are well-established.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Huawei's audio product development has a clear direction toward improving noise cancellation technology, which is measurable and auditorily effective, earning high evaluation. The proprietary L2HC codec for high bitrate transmission and pursuit of HiRes certification are rational approaches contributing to sound quality improvement. However, fundamental frequency response improvements remain insufficient, and design philosophy for sound quality aspects beyond noise cancellation has room for improvement. While the significance as dedicated audio equipment is recognized, differentiation from competing products in sound quality is insufficient, leaving overall rationality at moderate levels.

## Advice

For those considering Huawei products, the most recommendable users are those who prioritize noise cancellation performance above all. The ANC performance of FreeBuds Pro 3 is definitively industry-leading, making it an excellent choice for primary use in noisy environments. For music listening as the main purpose, default settings may feel lacking in low frequencies, but significant sound quality improvements are possible through 10-band EQ, allowing accommodation of sound quality-focused users with proper adjustment. For cost-performance priority, affordable products like the FreeBuds SE series represent excellent choices with high competitiveness in this price range. Regarding future support continuity due to political constraints, this varies by region, so verification before purchase is recommended.
