## Overview

SW1X Audio Design (pronounced As One X Audio Design) is a high-end audio equipment manufacturer based in Essex, UK, specializing in NOS (Non-Oversampling) DACs with tube output stages. The company advocates "ultimate high-performance audio equipment design" and designs and hand-assembles all products in the UK. Founder and chief engineer Dr. Slawa Roschkow draws inspiration from Audio Note UK while pursuing his own unique direction. The product lineup is divided into six performance levels from DAC I to the flagship DAC V Special model, with the top-tier models priced at approximately 80,000 euros.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

SW1X Audio Design DACs intentionally adopt NOS design that does not perform oversampling, jitter reduction, noise shaping, or reclocking, passing ultrasonic noise directly through, resulting in measurement performance at problem levels by modern standards. The vintage DAC chips used, including TDA1541, PCM56, and TDA1543, are significantly inferior to modern ESS ES9038PRO and AK4499 in terms of THD above 0.1%, S/N ratio below 90dB, and dynamic range below 100dB. No measurement data exists from Audio Science Review, and the company openly declares "musicality over measurement values," making it difficult to achieve transparent levels (THD below 0.01%, S/N ratio above 105dB). The addition of tube output stages further deteriorates distortion rates, and scientifically audible improvement effects cannot be expected.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The company develops unique designs combining tube output stages with R2R ladder technology, but the technological elements used are fundamentally outdated. DAC chips like TDA1541 and PCM56 from the 1980s were excellent for their time but are technically inferior compared to modern multibit delta-sigma DACs. While manufacturing attention to detail such as hand assembly and high-quality components is acknowledged, the design philosophy itself goes against the progress of modern digital audio technology. Individual technological elements like 6N6P tubes and dedicated power circuits show certain technical capabilities, but overall must be evaluated as below industry average technical level.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

SW1X Audio Design's DAC V Special is priced at approximately 80,000 euros, but products with equivalent or superior functionality (DAC conversion, multiple inputs/outputs) and measurement performance exist, such as Topping E70 (699USD, approximately 642 euros), Topping D90 III Discrete (999USD, approximately 917 euros), and SMSL VMV D2 (1,699USD, approximately 1,560 euros). These products exceed SW1X with SNR>120dB and THD<0.0001%, and for company review, weighted average of multiple representative products is calculated (selection reason: superior measurement performance and equivalent functionality, world lowest price class). Calculation example: 642EUR รท 80,000EUR = 0.008, 917EUR รท 80,000EUR = 0.011, 1,560EUR รท 80,000EUR = 0.020, average approximately 0.013, representing world-class worst cost-performance. Furthermore, equivalent functionality can be achieved with PC + high-performance DAC combinations for a few hundred euros. In pure functionality and performance evaluation excluding vintage value or craftsmanship value, it is difficult to find rationality for existing as dedicated audio equipment.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

SW1X Audio Design operates continuously and maintains a hand-assembly production system in the UK, providing certain reliability. They adopt a made-to-order model and can be expected to provide individualized support. However, specific failure rate data, MTBF, and detailed information about warranty periods are not publicly available, making comparison with industry standards difficult. Due to the design using tubes, there are expected to be component lifespan and temperature management challenges compared to solid-state devices. As a small specialized manufacturer, the support level is estimated to be standard, but comprehensive service systems like those of major manufacturers cannot be expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

SW1X Audio Design's design philosophy lacks scientific basis and goes against rational approaches in modern digital audio. NOS design allowing ultrasonic noise transmission, intentional filtering elimination, and adherence to vintage DAC chips do not contribute to measurable sound quality improvement. The claims of "prioritizing musicality" and "disregarding measurement values" can be interpreted as an unscientific attitude avoiding objective evaluation. Adopting tube output stages increases distortion rates, moving away from achieving modern transparent levels. Despite being able to realize equivalent functionality much more affordably through PC + high-performance DAC combinations, the necessity of existing as dedicated equipment is unclear. Design philosophy that goes against industry technological progress must be said to have problems from a rationality perspective.

## Advice

SW1X Audio Design products cannot be recommended for purchasers who prioritize measurement performance and cost-performance. The functionality and performance obtainable for 80,000 euros can be realized much more affordably and with superior measurement performance through products like the Topping E70 (699USD, approximately 642 euros) or SMSL VMV D2 (1,699USD, approximately 1,560 euros). Furthermore, PC + high-performance DAC combinations can substitute equivalent functionality for a few hundred euros, reducing the necessity of dedicated equipment. While there may be certain value for enthusiasts who prefer tube distortion and NOS design tonal changes, these represent tonal changes (distortion) rather than objective sound quality improvement. For those considering purchase, we strongly recommend comparing combinations of modern technology DAC + amplifier + speakers within the same budget. Particularly for younger generation music lovers, we recommend choosing modern audio systems based on scientific evidence. If prioritizing return on investment, products from this company should be avoided.
