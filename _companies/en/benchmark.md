## Overview

Founded in 1985 in Syracuse, New York, Benchmark Media Systems is an extremely unique American audio equipment manufacturer operated by a hybrid team of musicians, audiophiles, and professional audio engineers. The company's philosophy is "applying measurement-grade performance to music reproduction," emphasizing durability and reliability equally with sound quality.

The DAC3 series and AHB2 power amplifier achieve industry-leading measured performance while earning Stereophile's "Digital Component of the Year" finalist status at 1/16th the price of dCS Vivaldi, realizing extraordinary cost-performance. Through advanced technologies like quad balanced 32-bit ES9028PRO DAC chips and UltraLock3 jitter attenuation systems, they fundamentally transform conventional "reference" concepts.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Benchmark's technology is completely proven by measured data. The DAC3 achieves distortion and noise 20-30dB lower than high-quality power amplifiers, realizing minimum 21-bit resolution. The AHB2's 132dB dynamic range is 10-30dB quieter than premium reference amplifiers, achieving noise-free operation across the full 0.1Hz-200kHz bandwidth. These performances are clearly demonstrated through objective measurements, possessing fundamental technical advantages distinct from Class-D amplifiers. Complete isolation from interface jitter through the UltraLock3 jitter attenuation system is also scientifically verified.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Benchmark's technical standards represent industry-leading levels. Cutting-edge designs include quad balanced 32-bit ES9028PRO DAC chips, UltraLock3 jitter attenuation systems, and internal digital headroom preventing intersample overs. The AHB2 achieves complete jitter isolation for 192kHz non-compatible USB 2.0, S/PDIF, and AES3 inputs, supporting 32-bit PCM and native DSD conversion. The company's technical team integrates knowledge from professional audio, musicians, and audiophiles, maintaining the highest technical capabilities in both theory and practice. Through designs combining innovation and practicality, they elevate industry technical standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Benchmark's overall cost-performance, while inferior to Chinese manufacturers in basic measured performance, maintains excellent professional quality standards. The DAC3 HGC (USD 1,600, THD+N -118dB, SNR 124dB) faces competition from the equivalent Topping D90SE (USD 900, THD+N -120dB, SNR 125dB), yielding CP = USD 900 ÷ USD 1,600 = 0.56. The AHB2 (USD 2,133, THD+N -122dB, 200W/8Ω) competes with the basic performance Topping LA90 Discrete (USD 533, THD+N -124dB, 200W/8Ω), yielding CP = USD 533 ÷ USD 2,133 = 0.25. However, considering comprehensive value including UltraLock3 jitter attenuation technology, measurement-grade 21-bit resolution, and long-term reliability, they provide overwhelming cost-performance in the luxury audio market by achieving equivalent performance to dCS Vivaldi at 1/16th the price. Given technical reliability and professional support as a measurement equipment manufacturer, the pricing is reasonable.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Since founding in 1985, Benchmark has established a solid position as a professional audio equipment manufacturer. Company products emphasize durability and reliability in design, maintaining quality for extended use. Consistent quality control at US headquarters ensures high product stability. Industry evaluation is extremely high, earning Stereophile's Class A recommended component status, guaranteeing long-term value. However, domestic Japanese support infrastructure is limited, relying on support through authorized import distributors.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Benchmark's design philosophy is extremely rational. Based on the clear goal of "applying measurement-grade performance to music reproduction," all design decisions are supported by objective data. By integrating knowledge from musicians, audiophiles, and professional engineers, they achieve both theoretical excellence and practicality. The AHB2's design philosophy of "transparency without amplifier characteristics" perfectly aligns with basic acoustic engineering principles of faithful reproduction. Occult elements are completely eliminated, with consistent design based purely on scientific and engineering approaches, simultaneously achieving measurement-grade performance and musical satisfaction.

## Advice

Benchmark is optimal for serious audiophiles seeking both "measurable ultimate performance" and "musical satisfaction." The transparency, once experienced, offers such completeness that other equipment feels inadequate.

- **Reference System Construction**: The DAC3 HGC + AHB2 combination provides "endgame" level performance far exceeding its price point. For many audiophiles, this represents a level where further upgrades become unnecessary.
- **Professional Users**: Measurement-grade performance makes it optimal for mastering and recording reference monitoring, directly contributing to improved music production precision.
- **Measurement Data Priority**: For those seeking ultimate performance through objective data, considering price, it provides the world's best cost-performance.
- **Budget-Conscious Buyers**: For equivalent basic performance at lower prices, consider Chinese DACs (Topping, SMSL, etc.). However, clear differences exist in professional quality and long-term reliability.

Benchmark products are positioned as "the final answer in audio equipment." Their overwhelming transparency and measured performance reproduce all information contained in music without omission, providing true musical experiences. For those seeking value beyond price, no more certain choice exists.
