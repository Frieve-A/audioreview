## Overview

MYER-AUDIO is a brand focused on in-ear monitors (IEMs) under the SLIIVO line. It emphasizes hybrid driver designs (dynamic + balanced armature) and distinctive faceplate aesthetics. The company **claims** “over two decades of industry experience” (company claim; third-party verification not found) [8]. Current lineup highlights include the SLA3 (original 103.99 USD; often discounted) [4] and SL-41 MK2 (regular 180 USD; often discounted) [5], plus the newer SL224 eight-driver hybrid [6].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Independent third-party frequency-response (FR) data exist on a B&K Type 5128 fixture for multiple MYER-AUDIO models. The SLA3 and SL-41 MK2 have 5128 FR traces published in Crinacle’s database/tools [1][2][3]. These establish basic tuning characteristics but comprehensive transparent-level metrics (e.g., wideband THD vs SPL, passive isolation in dB with method disclosure) are limited in public sources as of August 19, 2025. Manufacturer electrical specs for SLA3 state **impedance 40 Ω** and **sensitivity 107 dB** [4]. SL-41 MK2 is commonly listed at **43 Ω / 108 dB** on retailer and community spec pages [5]. Given FR data availability but scarce full-suite measurements, a neutral midpoint score is retained.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Designs employ conventional hybrid architectures (e.g., SLA3: 1DD+3BA; SL-41 MK2: 1DD+4BA) with 3-way crossovers and off-the-shelf BA units (e.g., Knowles) [4][5]. The SL224 expands driver count (2DD+2BA+4 micro-planar) [6]. These are competent, industry-standard approaches; no distinctive proprietary breakthroughs or demonstrably superior objective performance are documented.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Method (company review):** Weighted average across representative, actively sold models (SLA3 and SL-41 MK2). With no disclosed shipment mix, weights are evenly set (0.5/0.5) for objectivity.

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator used for both:** **Truthear HEXA (1DD+3BA)** at **79.99 USD** (regular price) [9]. HEXA offers equal-or-better user-facing function (wired IEM with detachable 0.78 mm 2-pin cable) and neutral-leaning FR validated on the same 5128 framework [10], satisfying the equivalence rule.

- **SLA3 (103.99 USD)** vs HEXA (79.99 USD): CP = 79.99 ÷ 103.99 ≈ **0.77**.  
  Rationale: comparable hybrid functionality; SLA3 has 1DD+3BA, HEXA 1DD+3BA; both have neutral-biased FR on 5128 [2][10]; manufacturer electrical specs confirm normal drivability [4][9].
- **SL-41 MK2 (180 USD)** vs HEXA (79.99 USD): CP = 79.99 ÷ 180 ≈ **0.44**.  
  Rationale: same user-facing function; 5128 FR available for SL-41 MK2 [3]; no evidence of objectively superior transparency over HEXA.

**Weighted company CP:** (0.77×0.5) + (0.44×0.5) ≈ **0.61 ⇒ 0.6** (0.1-step rule).

> Notes: Regular (non-sale) prices were used where both regular and discounted prices were displayed [4][5][9].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Products are mainly sold via third-party retailers (e.g., HiFiGo) [4][5][6]. HiFiGo’s policy states **1-year warranty** for IEMs [7]; SL-41 MK2’s product page also indicates **12-month guarantee** [5]. Direct manufacturer support channels are not clearly documented. Distribution and service structure are adequate but thin for a global brand.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The brand promotes artistic shells and increased driver counts while adhering to common hybrid topologies [4][5][6]. Marketing language (e.g., “studio monitor-like sound”) lacks corroborating comprehensive third-party metrics. The approach is mainstream and functional but not demonstrably optimized for transparent-level performance.

## Advice

SLA3 is the more compelling value within the catalog at its bracket, but **Truthear HEXA at 79.99 USD** remains a strong cheaper alternative with comparable or better measured tuning [9][10]. SL-41 MK2 faces tougher price-to-performance headwinds given cheaper neutral competitors. Choose MYER-AUDIO primarily if you prefer its aesthetics and bundle; for strictly measurement-first value, consider the comparator.
