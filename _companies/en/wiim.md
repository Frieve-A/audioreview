## Overview

WiiM is a music streaming device brand under China's LinkPlay Technology (established 2014). Founded by experienced engineers from Google, Broadcom, Harman, and InterVideo, the company initially provided OEM supply to major manufacturers like Yamaha, Marshall, Edifier, and Audio Pro. Entering the 2020s, they launched the proprietary WiiM brand, rapidly expanding market share by offering products with extremely high-performance measurement values at breakthrough prices, including the Ultra with ES9038Q2M DAC and Pro Plus with AKM4493SEQ.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

WiiM products demonstrate clearly excellent measurement performance. The Ultra (329 USD) achieves SNR 121dB, THD+N -116dB (0.00018%), and frequency response Â±0.05dB, significantly exceeding transparency levels. The Pro Plus (219 USD) also covers the audible range sufficiently with AKM4493SEQ DAC supporting 32bit/384kHz PCM and DSD512. These measurement values are equivalent to or better than products in 10x+ price ranges, providing scientifically clear benefits. However, the reliance on OEM DAC chips rather than in-house development prevents the highest rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

WiiM's technical strength lies in proper implementation of existing high-quality DAC chips (ES9038Q2M, AKM4493SEQ). While their wireless technology and multi-room functionality from the LinkPlay era are commendable, the DAC design itself uses third-party products. Product planning capability is high with Wi-Fi 6 support, Room Correction functionality, and touchscreen integration, and TI TPA3255 amplifier circuit implementation is appropriate. However, there is no evidence of proprietary DAC design or innovative analog circuit technology, limited to system integration technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

WiiM's cost performance is extremely high, reaching levels that disrupt industry price structures. The Ultra (329 USD) measurement performance (SNR 121dB, THD+N -116dB) is far more affordable than purchasing equivalent-performance Topping E70 Velvet (499 USD) plus separate streamer. The Pro Plus (219 USD) also holds cost-performance advantage compared to Cambridge Audio MXN10 (399 USD). The pricing achieved through Chinese manufacturing cost reduction and mass production technology from LinkPlay era represents levels impossible for traditional audio equipment manufacturers.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

WiiM's reliability is good for a Chinese manufacturer. Quality control systems are established from LinkPlay era OEM experience with major manufacturers, and firmware updates are actively provided. However, the warranty period is short at 1 year, and repair systems operate through distributors. As an emerging brand, concerns exist about long-term parts supply and support continuity, particularly 3-5 year response is unclear. Response speed for failures and technical support quality may be inferior compared to traditional Japanese and Western manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

WiiM's design philosophy is extremely rational. By adopting high-performance DAC chips and achieving transparency levels through measurement values, they realize a scientific approach to sound quality. The necessity as dedicated audio equipment is sufficiently secured through multi-input support, Room Correction, and multi-room functionality. The system integration-focused design for cost reduction is also rational. However, some products other than Ultra do not reach transparency levels in measurement values, and long-term product support strategy remains unclear, preventing complete rationality.

## Advice

WiiM represents one of the best choices in the current market for measurement performance and price balance. Particularly, the Ultra achieves transparency-level measurement values at 329 USD, realizing pricing impossible for traditional audio equipment manufacturers. When considering purchase, understand the support continuity risk of an emerging brand for 3-5 years ahead, then decide whether to prioritize current performance and price advantages. For measurement-focused users seeking budget efficiency, this is an optimal choice, but those prioritizing long-term peace of mind and brand reliability should compare with traditional manufacturers. The Pro Plus particularly offers an extremely excellent entry-level choice, achieving 32bit/384kHz support at the breakthrough price of 219 USD.
