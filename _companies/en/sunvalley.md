## Overview

Sunvalley was the audio business division of Sunvalley Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toyota Industries Corporation. Mr. Shin Ohashi, who comes from a background in the apparel industry, launched the vacuum tube audio business in 1998 as an in-house venture. The company manufactured and sold analog audio equipment centered on SET (Single-Ended Triode) amplifiers using 845 and 211 tubes, along with preamplifiers and phono equalizers. Their flagship product SV-S1628D was sold from 1,700 USD (kit) to 2,350 USD (assembled unit), with distribution to the North American market through VK Music. However, it has been announced that the audio business will be discontinued due to the retirement of the business head, Mr. Ohashi, and all support will cease in the future.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Measurement performance shows results significantly below modern acoustic technology standards. The flagship product SV-S1628D has a published THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) value of 10%, a distortion level that is 10 times higher than the 1% considered "unacceptable" for audio amplifiers, and 10,000 times higher than the 0.001% level achieved by excellent amplifiers. This figure far exceeds the human auditory threshold for detecting distortion (around 1%), making faithful reproduction of the original sound source completely impossible.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The technology is based on vacuum tube designs that have existed since the 1920s, with no new technologies adopted that contribute to objective performance improvement compared to modern semiconductor technology. The company appeals to subjective and emotional values such as "unique vacuum tube sound" or "musicality," which does not contribute to objective audio quality improvement. The 16W low output is also insufficient for driving modern speakers, lacking technical necessity when the 89.99 USD Fosi Audio V3 achieves a measured 38W×2 (8Ω load). Analog record-dedicated phono equalizers also represent an irrational approach that actively introduces audio quality degradation in an era where digital conversion enables zero-degradation source reproduction.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The assembled SV-S1628D was sold in the North American market for 2,350 USD. For comparison with international products, this review uses the North American price as a benchmark. Based on this, a modern Class D amplifier with equivalent or superior functionality and performance, the Fosi Audio V3 (89.99 USD), is available at one of the world's lowest prices. The V3 boasts measured performance of 38W×2 output (8Ω load), 0.003% THD, and 110dB SNR, significantly surpassing the SV-S1628D's 16W×2 and 10% THD. The cost-performance calculation (based on international market prices) is: 89.99 USD ÷ 2,350 USD = 0.038, which rounds to 0.0. This result indicates that equivalent functionality to the reviewed product is available for about 1/26th of the price, highlighting an extremely large price disparity with modern technology.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The division operated as part of Sunvalley Corporation. In Apr 2025, it was announced that the audio business would be discontinued due to the retirement of the business head, and all support services will be terminated at the end of October 2029. As the business division is closing, future support will be completely unavailable, making repairs for any malfunctions impossible. While the supply of consumable parts like vacuum tubes may continue from third-party sources, maintenance and repair of the main unit will be the sole responsibility of the user.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The design philosophy lacks rationality from a modern audio engineering perspective. The choice of vacuum tube technology, which inherently produces high distortion levels (10% THD), directly contradicts the fundamental goal of audio reproduction: faithful reproduction of the source material. The emphasis on subjective qualities like "tube warmth" over objective performance metrics represents an irrational approach that prioritizes emotional appeal over scientific accuracy. The low power output (16W) is insufficient for modern speaker loads, and the focus on analog-only connectivity ignores the superior performance capabilities of digital audio technology.

## Advice

Sunvalley products cannot be recommended by scientific audio standards. Equivalent or superior performance to the SV-S1628D (2,350 USD) is available with the 89.99 USD Fosi Audio V3, making the 26-fold price difference unreasonable. The V3 demonstrates objective performance with 0.003% THD, 110dB SNR, and measured 38W×2 output (8Ω load) that significantly exceeds Sunvalley products' 10% THD and 16W×2 specifications. Furthermore, the company has announced the cessation of its audio business, and all support will be terminated at the end of October 2029. Considering this, a new purchase carries an extremely high risk. For users seeking maximum audio quality within limited budgets, modern Class D amplifiers and digital technology-based products are strongly recommended.
