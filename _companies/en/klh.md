## Overview

KLH was founded in 1957 in Cambridge, Massachusetts by Henry Kloss, Malcolm Low, and Josef Hofmann as an American heritage speaker manufacturer. Once the world's largest speaker company employing over 500 people and shipping more than 30,000 units annually. As pioneers of acoustic suspension design, they produced historical classics like Model Five, Model Six, and Model Seventeen, with the electrostatic Model Nine selected among "12 Greatest Speakers of All Time." Currently operated in Indiana after acquisition by Kelley Global Brands in 2017.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Current Model Three meets basic acoustic performance but falls short of transparent levels. Third-party test bench conditions report in-room measurements at the main listening seat (10 ft), 1/6-oct smoothing, speakers on included stands and toed-in to face the mic; when used with subs the crossover was 90 Hz and room EQ applied only below 300 Hz [1]. The crossover is 1.5 kHz (12 dB/oct), and the HF switch above 400 Hz provides -1.5 dB (Mid) and -3.0 dB (Low) cuts with Hi as neutral [2]. These specifics align with sealed-box behavior (12 dB/oct LF rolloff). Sensitivity and minimum impedance figures are not confirmed in the accessible article text. Per policy, with partial measurement uncertainty remaining, the score is kept at 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While historically pioneering acoustic suspension design, current technology level falls below industry average. Configuration of 1-inch aluminum dome tweeter and pulp cone woofer is standard with no notable technical innovations. Sealed enclosure design is dated compared to modern port tuning techniques and advanced driver technologies without competitive advantages. Measurement data transparency is also low, failing to meet contemporary technical standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Model Three MSRP is 1,800 USD/pair [2]. As a modern bookshelf comparator with equal-or-higher design ambition, KEF Q Concerto Meta is listed at £1,049/pair [3]. Using FX GBP→USD=1.343852 (UTC 2025-08-10) [4], converted price = £1,049 × 1.343852 = 1,409.70 USD/pair. Therefore CP = comparator_lowest_price ÷ ModelThree_price = 1,409.70 USD ÷ 1,800 USD = 0.783. Per the 0.1-step policy, the score rounds to 0.8.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Stability has improved under Kelley Global Brands operation since 2017 acquisition. Standard product warranty and customer support are provided, but track record as emerging manufacturer remains limited. Specific data on product failure rates or long-term reliability is not publicly available. Support system meets industry standard levels, though more comprehensive support would be expected from a historically established company.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Adherence to acoustic suspension design raises rationality concerns. While sealed design achieves reliable bass control, it is inferior to contemporary bass reflex designs in efficiency and cost perspectives. Insufficient measurement data disclosure despite high pricing lacks scientific approach. Product development relying on brand historical value is irrational from technological advancement standpoint. However, design is based on fundamental acoustic theory and not extremely unscientific.

## Advice

KLH may be an option for users prioritizing historical significance and traditional sound characteristics, but cannot be recommended when objective performance and pricing are priorities. Choosing modern-designed speakers like Wharfedale Diamond 12.1 (300 USD) or KEF Q Concerto Meta (1,300 USD) within the same budget provides superior acoustic performance and cost-effectiveness. Strong recommendation for selection based on measurable performance rather than brand image. Rather than expecting historical classics revival, pursue transparent-level acoustic performance through contemporary technology.
