## Overview

Founded in 1974, ATC (Acoustic Transducer Company) is a speaker manufacturer that has established an absolute position in the professional audio world. For 50 years since its founding, it has been adopted as reference monitors in recording studios worldwide and is beloved by globally renowned engineers such as George Massenburg, Chuck Ainlay, and Nathaniel Kunkel.

The company's greatest characteristic is that all monitors are handcrafted in the UK. Through proprietary Super Linear (SL) driver technology, it achieves extremely low distortion characteristics that were difficult with conventional speakers. Particularly the latest product lineup including SCM45A Pro, SCM50ASL Pro, and SCM25A Pro Mk2 provides the high precision and reliability demanded in professional environments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

ATC products are thoroughly designed based on scientific measurement data, with effects clearly verified. The SCM25A Pro Mk2 achieves extremely excellent distortion characteristics of THD+N < 0.003% (-92dB). The SCM45A Pro and SCM50ASL Pro can deliver continuous output of up to 112dB SPL, with these figures confirmed by independent third-party measurements. Particularly the wide ±80-degree horizontal directional characteristics achieve a broad sweet spot that was difficult with conventional narrow-directivity monitors, with effects clearly identifiable in blind tests. The latest SH25-76S dual-suspension tweeter shows confirmed measurement data for high-frequency distortion reduction and frequency response improvement.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

ATC's technical level is at the industry's highest standard. The proprietary Super Linear (SL) driver technology is groundbreaking technology achieving extremely low harmonic distortion impossible with conventional speakers. Particularly the SCM50ASL Pro's Super Linear 9-inch bass driver achieves both low-frequency reproduction down to 38Hz and excellent acoustic characteristics. The latest SH25-76S dual-suspension tweeter realizes high-frequency reproduction up to 25kHz with extremely low distortion characteristics. Additionally, custom-designed MOSFET Class A/B tri-amp systems provide optimized amplification for each driver. All these technologies establish unique technical superiority through in-house development and manufacturing in the UK that other companies cannot replicate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While ATC products are expensive considering absolute reliability and handcrafted quality for professional use, their value is sufficient. For example, products with equivalent measurement performance to the SCM45A Pro (approximately USD 16,670 per pair) include the Neumann KH420 (USD 11,590 per pair) and Genelec 8341A (USD 5,250 per pair). Using the most affordable equivalent performance product price of USD 5,250 as baseline, CP = USD 5,250 ÷ USD 16,670 ≈ 0.3. This price includes quality from handcrafting in the UK and long-term reliability proven in professional environments.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

ATC products have proven high reliability through their track record of long-term use in professional studios worldwide. Handcrafted manufacturing in the UK ensures strict quality control, with each product individually inspected and adjusted. Professional use designs withstand 24-hour continuous operation, with many studios actually maintaining stable operation throughout the year. International support systems are well-established, with comprehensive after-sales service provided through authorized distributors in Japan. However, due to handcrafted product characteristics, repairs and replacement parts procurement may require time.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

ATC's design philosophy is extremely rational, based on the clear goal of "accurate acoustic reproduction." All design decisions have scientific basis to achieve the accuracy demanded in professional use. Development of Super Linear (SL) driver technology also aimed at solving the clear technical challenge of harmonic distortion elimination. The wide ±80-degree directional characteristics are rational design decisions responding to practical requirements for multi-person monitoring in studios. No unscientific "occult" elements exist, with all technical choices having measurable improvement effects. Adoption of dual-suspension tweeters is also based on concrete technical goals of distortion reduction and frequency response improvement.

## Advice

ATC is the optimal choice for users seeking professional-level accuracy and reliability. Particularly for those engaged in music production or acoustic engineering, the value as world-standard reference monitors is immeasurable.

- **Music Producers & Engineers**: SCM25A Pro Mk2 and SCM45A Pro have proven track records in studios worldwide, allowing accurate understanding of how your work will sound in other studios.
- **Audiophiles (Advanced)**: Hi-Fi models like SCM50 and SCM40 are valuable choices for experiencing studio monitor accuracy in home environments.
- **Budget-conscious individuals**: Pure measurement performance evaluation shows other manufacturers offer products with superior cost-performance. ATC's value lies in professional reliability and handcrafted quality.

For those who understand ATC's value as "world-standard reference" and judge it worth investing in that accuracy and reliability, ATC becomes the ultimate choice.
