## Overview

Superlux is a Taiwanese audio manufacturer founded in 1987, specializing in headphones and microphones for over 30 years. Initially supplying OEM components to major manufacturers like Sony, Kenwood, and Sharp, the company began manufacturing its own branded products in 1993. Headphones such as the HD681 and HD668B have achieved sales of over 100,000 units each, particularly gaining support from budget-conscious users. Currently operating a large-scale factory in Shanghai, Superlux supplies products worldwide and represents one of Taiwan's prominent audio brands.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Measurement results of Superlux's flagship HD681 show a frequency response within Â±3dB from 100Hz to 2.5kHz, which is acceptable, but a significant +10dB peak in the high frequencies creates audibly distinct tonal coloration. The HD668B exhibits measured ringing around 600Hz and 1.8kHz, failing to achieve transparency levels. The nominal THD is specified at 0.25% (at 100mW@1kHz), which deviates from modern transparency standards (where 0.05% or below is excellent for headphones). The CMH8A microphone series shows increased harmonic distortion in the 10Hz-20Hz range, failing to achieve complete transparency. Based on measurement data, the audible sound quality improvements are limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While Superlux possesses mass-production technology accumulated through years of OEM manufacturing, independent advanced technology development remains limited. The HD681 series follows conventional structural design patterns, showing no industry-leading innovation in driver design or acoustic engineering. The CMH8A microphone employs a 1-inch gold-sputtered diaphragm and FET preamp circuit, but these represent industry-standard technical configurations. Although basic design elements like transformer-balanced output are implemented, no advanced elements such as proprietary technologies or original technical papers are evident. While the cost-conscious, rational design is a positive aspect, technical breakthrough capabilities remain at average industry levels.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Superlux's representative product, the HD668B, is priced at approximately 30 USD, while a competitor with equivalent measurement performance and functionality, the Samson SR850, is priced at approximately 40 USD. Current market research shows the HD668B is available in the 27-35 USD range, while the SR850 ranges from 39-50 USD, making the Superlux model the more affordable option. The HD681 (approx. 35 USD) similarly represents excellent value. While professional studio monitors like the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x (approx. 100 USD) and Sony MDR-7506 (approx. 95 USD) offer different capabilities, they are in a significantly higher price bracket. In the budget headphone segment, Superlux products consistently offer equivalent or superior performance at the lowest available prices, resulting in excellent cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Superlux demonstrates reliability through over 30 years of manufacturing experience, having handled OEM manufacturing for renowned brands including Sony, Sharp, Electrovoice, and Behringer. The company provides an industry-standard 1-year product warranty and maintains support systems through distributors worldwide. However, specific failure rate and MTBF data are not publicly available, leaving aspects of long-term product reliability unclear. While the consistent quality control system between the Taiwan headquarters and the large Shanghai factory is a positive factor, the evaluation remains slightly above the industry average due to insufficient detailed reliability data at the individual product level. Since these products do not require firmware updates, this aspect is not applicable for evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Superlux's design philosophy of "delivering quality sound to music enthusiasts at affordable prices" represents a clear and rational approach. However, measurement data reveals tuning that prioritizes "musical coloration" over sonic transparency, as seen in the HD681's +10dB high-frequency peak and the HD668B's ringing. This constitutes an irrational choice from a scientific high-fidelity reproduction perspective. Conversely, the attitude of achieving maximum performance within cost constraints is commendable, and utilizing mass-production efficiency technology gained through OEM manufacturing is rational. However, fundamental measurement performance improvements are not observed even in new models, and clear technical progress toward achieving modern transparency levels cannot be confirmed, resulting in a moderate evaluation of design philosophy rationality.

## Advice

Superlux represents an excellent choice for budget-conscious users seeking reliable audio performance. The HD668B and HD681 offer exceptional value, consistently priced lower than direct competitors like the Samson SR850 while delivering equivalent measurement performance. Market research confirms Superlux maintains the most competitive pricing, with the HD668B available from 27-35 USD compared to the SR850's 39-50 USD range. While measurement data indicates these products do not achieve complete sonic transparency, they provide remarkable performance for their price point. For entry-level users and budget-conscious enthusiasts, Superlux products represent an optimal balance of performance and affordability. Regarding microphones, they are suitable for personal use and amateur recording, though professional applications may require higher-end alternatives. Within the budget segment, Superlux consistently offers a very high cost-performance ratio.
