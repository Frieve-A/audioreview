## Overview

Magnetar Audio focuses on high-end **universal** 4K UHD Blu-ray players with substantial chassis design and complete disc support (including SACD and DVD-Audio). The current range centers on the UDP-800 (1,599.99 USD) and the flagship UDP-900 (2,999.99 USD). Their design emphasizes measured analog output quality, format completeness, and Dolby Vision/HDR10+ video compatibility. [1][2][3][4][5]

## Scientific Validity
$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Third-party bench tests for **UDP-900** report **A-weighted SNR 119.5 dB (RCA) / 125.4 dB (XLR)** using a **–90 dB 1 kHz** stimulus and QA401 analyzer, indicating transparency-level analog performance. Representative THD+N cases (1 kHz/0 dBFS, 16-bit) remain low, with linear frequency response across the audible band. These independent measurements substantiate the analog stage quality beyond catalog claims. [1]

## Technology Level
$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Engineering highlights include a reinforced **double-layer aluminum chassis**, multi-board/shielded layout, and premium DAC topology (**ESS9038PRO** for 2-ch, **ESS9028PRO** for 7.1-ch). HDR format coverage includes **Dolby Vision** and **HDR10+**. Execution is clearly high-end, though the digital platform and features are evolutionary for this category rather than breakthrough. [2]

## Cost-Performance
$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Company-level CP is derived from representative models and the **cheapest equal-or-better alternatives** (USD market):

- **UDP-900 (2,999.99 USD)**  
  - *Video-equivalent comparator:* **Panasonic DP-UB9000 (1,099 USD)** — matches UHD formats incl. **Dolby Vision/HDR10+**; **not** a universal audio disc player (no SACD/DVD-A). **1,099 ÷ 2,999.99 = 0.366**. [5]  
  - *Universal-equivalent comparator:* **Reavon UBR-X200 (1,799 USD class)** — universal disc support with analog outputs; widely reported feature set at this price point. **1,799 ÷ 2,999.99 = 0.600**.  
  - *UDP-900 CP (mean of above):* **0.5**. [6]
- **UDP-800 (1,599.99 USD)**  
  - Identified universal-disc competitor with analog outputs (**Reavon UBR-X200**) is **higher priced** → CP upper limit applies (**>1.0 → 1.0**). [3][6]

**Company CP (equal weight on UDP-900/800):** **(0.5 + 1.0)/2 = 0.75 → 0.8**.

## Reliability & Support
$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Build quality is robust (heavy aluminum chassis; internal shielding). Global distribution and after-sales footprint remain boutique relative to mass brands, and long-term parts plans are not fully disclosed. No systemic reliability concerns are evidenced in current reputable sources. [2][4]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy
$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The development direction prioritizes **measurable** analog fidelity, complete disc support, and thorough mechanical/noise control—scientific, audibility-oriented choices. Costs are largely allocated to functions that can affect measurable performance (power supply, shielding, DACs), with minimal emphasis on non-falsifiable claims.

## Advice

Choose **Magnetar** if you need **one box** for **UHD video (Dolby Vision/HDR10+)** and **universal audio discs (SACD/DVD-A)** with high-grade **analog outputs**. If your usage is **video-only**, the **Panasonic DP-UB9000** offers similar picture formats and processing at a substantially lower price but lacks universal-disc audio. For stereo/multichannel analog playback from discs, Magnetar’s measured strengths justify the premium.
