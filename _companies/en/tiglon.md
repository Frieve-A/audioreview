## Overview

Tiglon Co., Ltd. is a Japanese audio cable manufacturer founded in 2008 by Kentaro Okino, with headquarters in Yamato City, Kanagawa Prefecture. The company began developing magnesium-based audio products in 2006 with their first magnesium speaker stand, followed by formal incorporation in 2008. The company specializes in audio cables and accessories featuring proprietary magnesium shielding technology, which received international patent protection in 2009 (Patent No. 4282759). Tiglon's product lineup includes interconnects, speaker cables, power cables, network cables, and audio racks, all incorporating their signature magnesium alloy shielding approach. The company's core mission focuses on creating "new value and unknown sound" while bringing "emotion" and "fun" to customers' audio experiences through their specialized magnesium-based solutions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Tiglon produces high-priced audio cables with interconnects priced at 1,000 USD per meter and TPL series cables ranging from 799-1,925 USD, claiming audible sound quality improvements such as "clear and highly natural sound" and "faithful transmission of signals" [1]. The company claims their magnesium shielding technology provides electromagnetic interference reduction, but no ABX blind test evidence exists to support claims of audible improvements. While magnesium shielding may provide technical benefits in laboratory conditions, this technical achievement does not translate to scientifically verified audible benefits for typical audio applications. According to established evaluation criteria, high-priced products claiming audible sound quality improvement without ABX blind test or equivalent evidence of audibility receive the lowest scientific validity rating.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Tiglon demonstrates significant technical sophistication through their patented magnesium electromagnetic wave shielding technology, developed through founder Kentaro Okino's mechanical engineering expertise. The company has established specialized know-how in magnesium alloy applications, utilizing materials with density 1.7 compared to copper's 8.9 and thermal conductivity of 51 W/mK. Their proprietary technologies include the HSE (Hyper Saturated Energizer) process that transmits frequencies up to 100 kHz through conductors to reduce cable break-in time. The magnesium foil tape shielding method, wound spirally from inner to outer direction, represents genuine innovation in cable construction. However, the technology remains primarily analog and mechanical without integration of modern digital, software, or AI approaches that characterize cutting-edge audio solutions.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Cost-performance evaluation reveals fundamental issues with Tiglon's pricing strategy. The MGL-R1 interconnects priced at 1,000 USD provide magnesium foil spiral shielding and 6N OFC conductors. However, equivalent-or-better shielding effectiveness is available through Blue Jeans Cable LC-2 at approximately 70 USD for typical lengths, featuring double-braid copper shielding with excellent EMI/RFI rejection and verified performance specifications [2]. Professional cable manufacturers like Mogami achieve similar or superior electromagnetic interference rejection through proven shielding techniques at significantly lower cost. CP = 70 USD ÷ 1,000 USD = 0.07. The extreme price premium cannot be justified by functional or performance improvements over established professional cable solutions.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Tiglon's reliability profile shows mixed characteristics with limited publicly available information regarding warranty terms and formal support procedures. The company operates through dealer-based support systems via distributors including Wising Audio in Singapore. Cable construction appears inherently reliable due to robust magnesium shielding materials and straightforward design with few failure-prone components. The company has maintained operations since 2008 without major reliability issues identified in available sources. However, specific warranty coverage, repair response times, and quality control procedures remain undocumented, limiting confidence in long-term support capabilities. The simple cable structure should provide adequate durability for typical audio applications.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Tiglon's design philosophy demonstrates fundamental scientific irrationality by emphasizing unmeasurable subjective effects over verifiable performance improvements. The company's approach centers on magnesium shielding technology for "faithful transmission of signals" while making audible improvement claims without ABX testing validation. Their pricing strategy creates extreme premiums (1,000+ USD versus 70 USD for equivalent shielding) that cannot be justified by functional or performance improvements. The design philosophy contradicts scientific approaches by focusing on subjective marketing appeals ("emotion and fun") rather than measurable performance metrics. While the company possesses legitimate technical expertise in magnesium applications, their approach lacks cost-effectiveness by investing in materials that provide no scientifically expected audible benefits. The philosophy emphasizes high-priced sales of basic cable functions already available through professional alternatives at dramatically lower cost.

## Advice

Potential purchasers should approach Tiglon products with significant caution due to fundamental cost-performance and scientific validity issues. While the company demonstrates genuine technical innovation in magnesium shielding applications, the extreme pricing cannot be justified by measurable performance improvements over professional alternatives. Consumers seeking effective EMI/RFI protection should consider established professional cable manufacturers like Blue Jeans Cable, Mogami, or Belden, which provide equivalent or superior shielding effectiveness at a fraction of Tiglon's pricing. The claimed electromagnetic shielding benefits of magnesium may represent technical achievement, but similar performance is available through conventional shielding methods at dramatically lower cost. Audio enthusiasts should prioritize cables with verified specifications, reasonable pricing, and proven professional track records rather than premium-priced products making unsubstantiated audible improvement claims.
