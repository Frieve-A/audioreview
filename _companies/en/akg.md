## Overview

Founded in Vienna in 1947, AKG (Akustische und Kino-Geräte) is Austria's representative audio equipment manufacturer. Since its founding, it has continued to lead the world in the development of professional microphones and headphones.

Particularly in the field of condenser microphones, they have created legendary products like the C414 and C12, which are used in recording studios worldwide. In the headphone field, they have produced classics like the K240 Studio and K702, beloved by many music producers. While acquired by Samsung in 2017, their technical legacy continues to be inherited today.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The scientific validity of AKG products is extremely high, with excellent consistency between objective measurement data and subjective listening, especially in professional products. Open-back headphones like the K702 have very flat frequency response, achieving faithful reproduction of the original sound.

The company's microphones also demonstrate industry-leading performance in objective metrics, with the C414 series in particular being trusted by professionals worldwide for its accuracy and reliability. These performances are measurable and reproducible, with design thoroughly based on scientific principles.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

AKG's technology level is at the industry's highest standard, with particularly overwhelming achievements in transducer technology compared to other companies. The precise acoustic design technology cultivated through years of microphone development is also utilized in current headphone development, resulting in very high technical completeness.

Their proprietary large-diameter driver units and precise acoustic design technologies are highly regarded in the industry, with their reliability in studio monitoring applications unmatched by competitors. Innovation in the microphone field also continues, with active development of products incorporating the latest digital technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (USD 150) has equivalent measurement performance to the K371 (USD 140), so CP = USD 140 ÷ USD 140 = 1.0. Philips SHP9500 (USD 70) has equivalent THD+N and frequency response to the K702 (USD 275), so CP = USD 70 ÷ USD 275 = 0.25. Sony MDR-7506 (USD 89) has equivalent measurement performance to the K240 Studio (USD 85), so CP = USD 85 ÷ USD 85 = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

AKG products generally have high reliability, but there are concerns about the support system after the Samsung acquisition. Particularly for older generation products, there may be challenges with parts supply and service continuity.

On the other hand, appropriate support is provided for currently produced flagship products, and quality control is maintained. However, there are differences in support systems by region, with the impression that support is particularly thin in the Japanese market compared to other companies.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

AKG's design philosophy is extremely rational, with product development based on the clear goal of "accurate sound reproduction." The company's products emphasize a scientific approach based on acoustic engineering, tending to prioritize objective performance over subjective sound crafting.

This rational approach is particularly evident in professional products, with an excellent balance of practicality and performance. The design philosophy of eliminating unnecessary decorations and features while concentrating on technologies that directly contribute to sound quality improvement can be said to pursue the essence of audio equipment.

## Advice

AKG products are ideal for professionals who value accurate sound reproduction and users with deep understanding of acoustic technology. Particularly for those involved in music production or acoustic engineering, the company's products are extremely valuable choices.

- **For Music Producers**: The K702 and K371 enable accurate monitoring and are ideal for mixing and mastering work.
- **For Recording Engineers**: Microphones like the C414 and C12 are standard equipment trusted for years in professional recording settings.
