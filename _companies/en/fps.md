## Overview

FPS Inc. is a Japanese company that claims to be the world's only manufacturer of MCMA (Multi Cell Micro-transducer Array) planar ribbon transducers for Hi-Fi applications. Founded with focus on developing ultra-thin flat panel speakers, the company holds patents for their MCMA technology across multiple countries including Japan, USA, EU, Russia, China, South Korea, India, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Their products range from miniature 2W units to larger 75W models, targeting applications from headphones and microphones to public address systems and commercial installations.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient credible third-party measurement data. FPS1010 manufacturer specifications show frequency response (130-13,000 Hz) that falls significantly short of transparent level standards (20Hz-20kHz Â±0.5dB) [1]. FPS0202 achieves wider range (360-20,000 Hz) but lacks crucial low frequencies below 360Hz [2]. Critical metrics including THD at various SPL levels, S/N ratio, and dynamic range remain undocumented from established measurement laboratories. Without independent verification from credible sources such as Audio Science Review or Erin's Audio Corner, evaluation relies on manufacturer claims only. Conservative 0.5 score assigned as manufacturer specifications lack sufficient audio-quality-relevant information for proper scientific assessment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

FPS demonstrates significant technical advancement through their patented MCMA technology, which places voice coils directly on liquid crystal polymer diaphragms with multi-planar magnets and micro-cells [4]. The company holds comprehensive global patent coverage across 11 countries, indicating substantial technical expertise and legal protection of their innovations. MCMA construction enables immediate transient response through elimination of heavy reactive components and produces planar waves rather than spherical waves [4]. The liquid crystal polymer diaphragm material provides waterproof, chemically stable, temperature stable, and fire-resistant properties. However, the technology remains purely analog without integration of modern digital processing or software capabilities.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

FPS 1010M3R1 current market price 240 USD represents the world's cheapest option for flat panel planar ribbon technology with MCMA implementation. Equipped with ultra-thin flat panel form factor and planar wave generation capabilities, and frequency response performance equivalent-or-better to specification range. No cheaper equivalent product exists providing equivalent user-facing functionality combining flat panel installation requirements with planar technology implementation. While conventional planar magnetic alternatives like Magnepan MMG exist at higher price points, they cannot fulfill equivalent flat panel mounting requirements essential for specialized applications. No cheaper equivalent exists, therefore CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

FPS guarantees reliable operation for over ten years and uses durable rare earth materials in construction [4]. The liquid crystal polymer diaphragm construction provides inherent resistance to environmental degradation with waterproof and temperature-stable properties. The company has established presence in commercial and public address applications in Japan. Support infrastructure appears primarily dealer-based rather than direct manufacturer support, and user community feedback is limited with sparse forum discussions regarding long-term reliability experiences.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

FPS demonstrates highly rational design philosophy through systematic scientific approach to planar wave generation and measurable efficiency improvements. The MCMA technology addresses specific functional limitations of conventional speakers with immediate transient response through elimination of heavy reactive components [4]. Design philosophy prioritizes practical benefits: planar wave generation provides focused output with reduced acoustic feedback susceptibility, improved intelligibility in noisy environments, and reduced ear fatigue compared to conventional spherical wave patterns [4]. The approach emphasizes durability (99.5% recyclable, eco-friendly manufacturing) and functional integration for specialized applications where conventional alternatives fail [4]. Philosophy focuses on solving real-world acoustic challenges through proprietary technology rather than pursuing subjective audiophile preferences, representing measurement-focused rational development approach.

## Advice

FPS Inc. products are recommended for specialized applications requiring ultra-thin flat panel speakers where conventional alternatives cannot fit or function effectively. The MCMA technology offers unique advantages for public address systems, commercial installations, and space-constrained environments. However, potential buyers should be aware of limited third-party measurement data availability. For general Hi-Fi applications, established planar magnetic manufacturers may provide better documented performance and broader community support. Consider FPS primarily when flat panel form factor and weatherproof operation are essential requirements that outweigh conventional speaker alternatives.
