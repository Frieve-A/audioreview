summary: "A Japanese value retailer offering ultra-cheap audio such as 1.33 USD wired earphones and 7.33 USD true wireless (TWS). Basic functionality is met, but third-party measurements are scarce and technical documentation is limited. Best for emergency or disposable use rather than quality-focused listening."

## Overview

Daiso is a Japanese discount chain founded in 1972. Beyond household goods, it sells basic audio accessories. Typical items include **wired earphones at 200円 (1.33 USD)** and **true-wireless models around 1,100円 (7.33 USD)**［1］［2］. Some products list **manufacturer specs** (e.g., frequency range, impedance, Bluetooth version), but **independent lab measurements** are generally unavailable［3］［4］.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

We found **no credible third-party measurements** (e.g., FR deviation, THD, passive isolation) for Daiso earphones. Only limited **manufacturer specifications** are available for representative models (e.g., wired “zipper-type” earphones: 20Hz–20kHz, 16Ω; TWS002 series: Bluetooth 5.x, stated battery time)［3］［4］. Starting from the unknown-data baseline (0.5), we deduct slightly due to limited specs and a past recall affecting BT earbuds, ending at **0.4**［5］.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Designs appear to use off-the-shelf parts with no evidence of proprietary DSP or advanced acoustic engineering. Daiso has issued iterative improvements (e.g., TWS-G273 series), but the overall engineering ambition remains basic by industry standards［3］［6］.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Two representative categories (cheapest equal-or-better with public measurements):**

- **Wired earphones (200円 / 1.33 USD)**  
  Same user-facing function (3.5mm in-ear). A widely measured budget IEM with superior, published data is **TRUTHEAR x Crinacle ZERO**, typically **~59.99 USD** in the U.S.［7］［8］. We found **no cheaper product** with **equal-or-better measured performance**. → **CP = 1.0** (no cheaper equivalent exists).

- **True-wireless (1,100円 / 7.33 USD)**  
  Same user-facing function (TWS + case). **JLab GO Air Pop** is a measured low-cost TWS at **~19–25 USD** with equal-or-better functionality and published results［9］［10］［11］. We found **no cheaper, measured equal-or-better** option. → **CP = 1.0**.

Weighted across the two categories, the company-level **CP remains 1.0**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Convenient store coverage helps with initial exchanges, but there is **no long-term support or repair** expectation. A prior **recall** for BT earbuds (risk of overheating while charging) underlines the quality variability typical at this price tier［5］.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

The strategy optimizes **price over measured fidelity**. While this is rational for disposable use, it does not pursue transparency-driven design validated by measurements.

## Advice

- Consider Daiso for **emergency/backup** use or scenarios with high loss risk.  
- If you value **audio quality or durability**, invest slightly more in a **measured** entry-level IEM (e.g., TRUTHEAR ZERO) or a **measured** budget TWS (e.g., JLab GO Air Pop) for far better long-term value［7］［9］.
