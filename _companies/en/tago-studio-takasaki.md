## Overview

TAGO STUDIO TAKASAKI is a Japanese company founded by composer/music producer Kunio Tago in Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture. Established as a professional recording studio in 2014, the company later expanded into headphone manufacturing with TOKUMI. The flagship T3-01 features solid maple wood housings and a silk protein–coated 40 mm driver developed with the Gunma Prefectural Textile Industrial Lab [1]. The official online store lists the T3-01 at 69,300円 tax-included (approx. 450 USD) [3]. The brand reports a VGP2018 award for the T3-01 on its official site [6].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For T3-01, only manufacturer-published specifications are available: frequency response 5 Hz–40 kHz, impedance 70 ohms, sensitivity 100 dB SPL/mW, and silk protein–coated 40 mm dynamic drivers [1][2]. Comprehensive third-party measurements (e.g., frequency response deviation in ±dB across 20 Hz–20 kHz, THD vs SPL, isolation) could not be confirmed as of the review date. The claimed bandwidth extends far beyond human hearing, so audible superiority remains unverified without independent data. Score is provisionally set at 0.5 pending reliable lab measurements.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The collaboration with the Gunma Prefectural Textile Industrial Lab on a silk protein diaphragm coating and the custom 40 mm driver indicate non-trivial in-house development beyond generic OEM parts [1]. The solid maple housings follow instrument-making practices and suggest careful acoustic design. Nonetheless, the core topology remains a conventional dynamic closed-back headphone without breakthrough, category-leading measured results, so 0.7 is appropriate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Reference market price: T3-01 approx. 450 USD (based on 69,300円 tax-included) [3]. As an equal-or-better comparator in user-facing functions and measured performance, AKG K361 is a closed-back wired over-ear with verified measurements (e.g., low THD ~0.05% at 94 dB SPL and 0.13% at 104 dB SPL; strong bass/mid target compliance) [4]. Current K361 market price is 118 USD on Amazon.com [5].

Cost-Performance = 118 USD ÷ 450 USD = 0.26 → rounded to 0.3.

Equivalence note: Both products provide closed-back wired monitoring functionality; the comparator has published third-party data for frequency response compliance and distortion that meets or exceeds practical monitoring needs under documented test conditions [4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Operations as a commercial studio since 2014 and active direct sales through the official Shopify store indicate continuity [3][6]. Global support remains limited, with primary focus on the Japanese domestic market. No broad reliability datasets (e.g., RMA rates) are publicly available.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Prioritizing studio-use practicality and collaborating on material science (silk protein coating) are rational directions [1]. However, emphasizing bandwidth beyond audibility without independent evidence of audible benefit weakens the rationale for premium pricing. Focus remains a niche, artisanal product rather than price-disruptive transparency.

## Advice

For users prioritizing artisanal build and the brand’s studio pedigree, T3-01 may appeal. For transparent monitoring with verified measurements at lower cost, consider measured options like AKG K361 [4][5]. Absent independent T3-01 lab data, selection should be driven by build/material preference rather than assumed measured superiority.
