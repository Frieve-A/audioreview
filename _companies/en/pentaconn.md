## Overview

Pentaconn is a brand of Nippon DICS (NDICS) focused on audio connectors and related accessories. The “Pentaconn” 4.4 mm 5-pole balanced interface is used by major products including Sony’s NW-WM1A (spec lists **4.4 mm balanced jack**), Sennheiser’s HDV 820 headphone amplifier (**4.4 mm Pentaconn socket** noted in the manual), and TEAC’s UD-505, which states the jack is **JEITA RC-8141C** compliant. Pentaconn has also expanded into finished audio, notably the **Scyne α01** single-dynamic IEM. [1][2][3][4][5]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Balanced wiring and robust mechanical contact are practical benefits of the 4.4 mm format, but there is no independent evidence that the connector itself yields audible improvements in THD, crosstalk, or dynamic range versus other well-designed terminations. Manufacturer statements for Scyne α01 (e.g., “clear and flat FR with little distortion”) are not accompanied by third-party measurements; TEAC’s documentation confirms **standard compliance** (RC-8141C) rather than audible advantage. [2][5]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Pentaconn demonstrates solid precision-mechanical design and production (materials, plating, tolerances) and helped formalize a compact, robust balanced plug for portable audio. Scyne α01 applies a conventional but careful single-dynamic architecture (LCP dome + LSR edge diaphragm, N55 magnet, internal acoustic shaping). These are competent, incremental advances rather than breakthroughs. [1][2][5]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Company-level CP is computed across two representative categories (connectors **70%**, IEMs **30%**). To avoid FX variance, we use **USD** pricing for both numerator (cheapest verified equal-function item) and denominator (Pentaconn item).

**(A) Connector — 4.4 mm 5-pole plug (NBP1-14-001)**  
- Pentaconn NBP1-14-001: **129.75 USD**. [8]  
- Cheapest equivalent (4.4 mm 5-pole solder-type plug): **17.48 USD**. [9]  
- **CP_A = 17.48 ÷ 129.75 = 0.135**

**(B) IEM — Scyne α01**  
- Scyne α01: **790 USD**. [6]  
- Reference with comprehensive independent measurements: **Etymotic ER4XR 309.99 USD** (with transparent-level measurements). [10][11]  
- **CP_B = 309.99 ÷ 790 = 0.392**

**Weighted company CP** = 0.7×0.135 + 0.3×0.392 = **0.21 → 0.2** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The 4.4 mm interface is widely deployed by major vendors, suggesting mature reliability for the core connector line. For newer complete products (e.g., Scyne), global field data and service pathways are still building. [1][3][4][5]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Standardizing a compact, robust balanced connector is a rational engineering response to portable-audio needs. The finished-product approach emphasizes material choice and acoustic structure, but the lack of transparent third-party measurements limits claims of measurement-driven audible advancement at this stage. [2][5]

## Advice

If you require **JEITA-aligned** 4.4 mm parts and tight tolerances, genuine Pentaconn plugs/jacks are safe choices. For DIY or cost-sensitive builds, low-cost 4.4 mm plugs deliver the same user-facing function at a fraction of the price. For IEMs, unless you specifically prefer Scyne α01’s build/tuning, a benchmark like **ER4XR** offers proven, well-documented performance at a lower price. [9][10][11]
