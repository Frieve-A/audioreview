## Overview

Cear, Inc. is a Japanese audio technology company founded on November 1st, 2018, headquartered in Tokyo. The company focuses on developing innovative spatial audio solutions through proprietary digital signal processing algorithms. Their flagship product, the Cear pavé CP-4000, represents a novel approach to 3D sound reproduction from a single portable speaker unit. Cear has established a strategic partnership with Qualcomm Technologies and participates in advanced audio certification programs, demonstrating technical credibility in the competitive portable audio market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated due to insufficient measurement data. No credible third-party measurements are available for frequency response, THD, S/N ratio, or other critical audio quality metrics that determine actual acoustic performance. While the Cear pavé supports high-quality codecs including aptX Lossless and 96kHz/24-bit USB audio input, without independent verification of acoustic output characteristics, this falls into the "unable to evaluate" category per evaluation framework guidelines. The product's 3D spatial audio claims through "Cear Field" technology remain unverified by objective measurement data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Cear demonstrates strong technical capabilities with multiple proprietary patents in sound processing and directivity control, representing genuine intellectual property development. The company has developed the "Cear Field" spatial audio algorithm and "Cear Link" multi-unit coordination technology through in-house design efforts, demonstrating original engineering expertise. Their strategic partnership with Qualcomm Technologies includes utilization of the cutting-edge S5 Gen 2 SoC and participation in the Qualcomm Voice & Music Extension Program, providing access to advanced audio processing hardware that competitors would find valuable to adopt. The sophisticated integration of DSP algorithms, gyroscope positioning, advanced Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity with aptX Lossless support, and comprehensive digital/software implementation demonstrates technical sophistication that would require significant time and expertise for new entrants to replicate.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comparison targets cannot be identified due to inability to perform numerical comparisons. No third-party measurements of critical audio quality metrics are available from credible sources, specifically missing: Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N), frequency response across audible spectrum, intermodulation distortion (IMD), dynamic range, and crosstalk measurements. Only manufacturer specifications and marketing claims are provided for the 30W total output power and sub-50ms latency performance. Advanced codec support including aptX Lossless and LE Audio capabilities are confirmed, but comparison is impossible due to lack of objective measurement data, resulting in a baseline score of 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Cear provides a standard 1-year warranty period, which falls below the typical 2-year industry standard for consumer electronics. However, the IPX7 waterproof construction indicates robust design engineering resistant to environmental damage. The company offers ongoing firmware updates through a dedicated mobile application, suggesting commitment to long-term product support. Support infrastructure appears primarily focused on the Japanese domestic market, with limited global service presence. The relatively simple DSP-based architecture with few moving parts should provide inherent reliability advantages over mechanically complex alternatives.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Cear demonstrates a rational, science-based approach using DSP technology and digital signal processing rather than relying on subjective audio marketing claims. The company's strategy of achieving 3D spatial audio through software algorithms is significantly more cost-effective than implementing multiple physical speaker arrays. Their adoption of cutting-edge Qualcomm SoC technology, modern wireless codecs, and software-based signal processing shows commitment to measurable technological advancement. The mission statement focusing on "cutting-edge technology to create new values" aligns with their actual implementation of innovative DSP solutions and partnership with leading semiconductor manufacturers.

## Advice

Cear represents an innovative approach to portable spatial audio with genuine technological merit through proprietary DSP algorithms and Qualcomm partnership. However, potential purchasers should be aware that equivalent spatial audio functionality is available at lower price points from established competitors. The lack of published acoustic measurements makes it impossible to verify actual sound quality performance compared to alternatives. Consider the Cear pavé if you specifically value the unique "Cear Field" technology and multi-unit linking capabilities, but evaluate against more cost-effective alternatives like the Soundcore Motion X600 that provide similar spatial audio functionality with better battery life and power output at 23% lower cost.
