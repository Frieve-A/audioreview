## Overview

UGREEN is a Chinese consumer electronics brand established in 2012 by Zhang Qingsen, based in Shenzhen, Guangdong. The company specializes in USB hardware including cables, AC adapters, wireless chargers, and audio equipment, serving over 200 million users globally. In the audio sector, UGREEN focuses primarily on USB-C to 3.5mm DAC adapters, offering multiple models ranging from budget-friendly options at 7.50 USD to higher-specification variants supporting up to 32bit/384kHz resolution. Their product lineup demonstrates a user-centered approach emphasizing affordability and broad device compatibility across major smartphone and tablet platforms.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific Validity receives the default conservative score of 0.5 due to insufficient measurement data from credible third-party sources. While manufacturer specifications claim S/N ratios exceeding 110dB for KT0210 chip models, which would exceed the transparent level threshold of 105dB, comprehensive performance data including THD, IMD, frequency response deviation, and crosstalk measurements are unavailable from independent testing laboratories. Available information consists primarily of manufacturer claims and limited forum discussions estimating output levels around 1V RMS. The uncertainty extends to actual DAC chip identification, with some models potentially using KT0210 supporting 24bit/96kHz while others claim 32bit/384kHz capability without verified implementation details.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

UGREEN employs standard industry DAC chips including KT0210 and potentially CS43131 in conventional reference designs. The technology implementation demonstrates competent engineering using proven, commodity components without proprietary patents or significant technical differentiation. Their approach utilizes appropriate contemporary DAC technology for the price point but offers no meaningful advantages over competitors using similar chip implementations. The products represent typical OEM/ODM designs with basic analog/digital integration, lacking innovation or technical barriers that would distinguish them in the marketplace. While functionally adequate, the technology demonstrates no particular advancement beyond established industry practices.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

UGREEN's USB-C to 3.5mm adapters currently sell for 7.50 USD for their standard Hi-Fi models with DAC chip support. Market research reveals cheaper equivalent alternatives, particularly the JSAUX USB-C to 3.5mm adapter available for 6.98 USD with built-in DAC chipset and comparable functionality. The JSAUX adapter provides equivalent USB-C to analog audio conversion with DAC processing, strain-relief design, and similar output specifications. Both adapters offer standard USB-C to 3.5mm conversion with DAC chips, equivalent device compatibility, and comparable audio output levels. CP = 6.98 USD รท 7.50 USD = 0.9. While UGREEN offers solid value, the market contains marginally cheaper alternatives with equivalent functionality, positioning UGREEN slightly above the most economical options in this competitive product category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

UGREEN provides global support infrastructure across multiple regions with standardized warranty processes. However, warranty coverage is limited to 1 year, below the industry average of 2 years for consumer electronics. The simple dongle construction with minimal moving parts inherently reduces potential failure modes, contributing to reliability. Support infrastructure includes established processes for warranty claims requiring proof of purchase and detailed defect documentation. Limitations include geographical restrictions on warranty coverage for products purchased outside the original country and potential return requirements for quality inspection. The company maintains product support status tracking but offers no extended support periods or specialized service programs.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

UGREEN demonstrates rational design philosophy through focus on proven DAC chip technology without making unsubstantiated audiophile claims. Their approach prioritizes cost-effectiveness with pricing directly aligned to functional capabilities rather than premium materials or subjective enhancements. The company avoids claims of scientifically non-audible effects while utilizing mature, verified technology implementations. However, the design philosophy remains conservative rather than innovative, utilizing standard reference designs without significant technological advancement. Their user-centered mission emphasizing affordability and broad compatibility aligns with rational market positioning, though the approach lacks the technological innovation or optimization that would elevate performance beyond commodity implementations.

## Advice

UGREEN USB-C to 3.5mm adapters represent a competitive solution for basic audio conversion needs at 7.50 USD, though slightly more expensive than the most economical alternatives like JSAUX at 6.98 USD. UGREEN offers solid value compared to premium options like the Apple USB-C adapter at 9.00 USD while providing broad device compatibility and adequate performance. For users prioritizing maximum affordability, consider cheaper alternatives, but UGREEN provides good value for those seeking established brand reliability. However, users requiring verified measurement specifications or premium audio performance should seek alternatives with published third-party testing data. The products serve excellently for general smartphone and tablet audio output where balanced functionality and cost-effectiveness are priorities, though audiophiles or professional applications would benefit from better-documented alternatives with superior measured performance.
