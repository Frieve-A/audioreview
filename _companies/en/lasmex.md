## Overview

LASMEX is a German-branded headphone manufacturer specializing in the research, development and manufacturing of audio equipment. The company positions itself with "Made in Germany" philosophy and claims to use "international leading electric-acoustic technology." Their product lineup includes professional studio monitor headphones (L-85, L-90, H-95 series) and wireless Bluetooth models (HB-65, HB-69). The company has received recognition from European audio magazines, with their H120 model receiving positive assessment from German HIFITEST noting balanced sound signature and build quality exceeding expectations for its price category.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

LASMEX products demonstrate severe performance limitations when evaluated against measurement criteria. The L-85 model specifies 3% THD, which significantly exceeds the 0.5% problematic threshold for headphones and represents severely compromised audio quality [2]. However, user reports suggest contradictory information regarding distortion performance, with Head-Fi users describing "very little distortion" [7]. Given the manufacturer specification of 3% THD as the primary verifiable data point, this represents performance far below acceptable levels. The frequency response of 15-25kHz is substantially narrower than the ideal 20Hz-20kHz range. Available third-party measurements for the H120 model indicate "poor detail and worse tuning" according to GREQ's assessment [4].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The company employs conventional 50mm dynamic driver technology without evidence of proprietary patents, cutting-edge innovations, or competitive technical advantages. Products utilize standard analog headphone implementations common across the industry. Marketing claims of "international leading electric-acoustic technology" lack substantiation through specific technical details or measurable innovations. No adoption of modern DSP, advanced digital processing, or smartphone-era integration technologies was identified. The technology approach represents mature, easily replicated designs without significant know-how accumulation or barriers to entry for competitors.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Cost-performance analysis reveals significant alternatives with superior specifications at lower prices. The Superlux HD668B at approximately 35 USD provides demonstrably better performance: THD of 0.3% versus L-85's 3%, extended frequency response of 10Hz-30kHz versus L-85's limited 15-25kHz range, and equivalent semi-open design with detachable cable functionality [5][6]. With LASMEX L-85 pricing at approximately 80 USD when available, the cost-performance calculation yields CP = 35 USD รท 80 USD = 0.4. The HD668B demonstrates superior measured performance across frequency response range and distortion specifications, representing equivalent functionality at substantially lower cost.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Support infrastructure shows typical limitations for smaller specialized manufacturers. No comprehensive warranty period information, repair system details, or failure rate data were publicly available during investigation. The simple analog construction with conventional 50mm dynamic drivers provides inherent reliability advantages through proven technology and fewer potential failure points. Global support infrastructure details remain unclear, with support appearing primarily dealer-dependent rather than direct manufacturer channels. Limited public information about long-term product support and service availability affects confidence for potential buyers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

LASMEX emphasizes "Made in Germany" philosophy and subjective "user experience" focus rather than measurement-based performance optimization. Claims of "scientific and technological innovations" lack substantiation through objective performance improvements or cutting-edge technology adoption [1]. The company prioritizes subjective evaluations over measurement-focused scientific validity, representing an approach contrary to evidence-based audio engineering. No evidence of DSP integration, advanced digital processing, or modern functional integration. The design philosophy demonstrates regression in measured performance (3% THD) compared to available alternatives, indicating irrational cost allocation toward non-performance factors.

## Advice

Potential buyers should exercise caution when considering LASMEX products due to fundamental performance and availability limitations. The company's flagship L-85 and L-90 models are currently unavailable in major markets, significantly limiting purchase options. When available, LASMEX products demonstrate poor cost-performance compared to alternatives like the Superlux HD668B, which provides superior measured performance at approximately half the price. The 3% THD specification represents significantly compromised audio quality that exceeds acceptable thresholds for serious audio applications. Prospective purchasers are advised to prioritize readily available alternatives with verified performance specifications and established market presence.
