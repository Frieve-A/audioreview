## Overview

Cypher Labs was an American audio company based in Lake Oswego, Oregon, that specialized in high-end portable and desktop audio hardware including headphone amplifiers, DACs, and vacuum tube equipment. The company produced notable products such as the Theorem 720 DAC/headphone amplifier, AlgoRhythm Trio portable tube amplifier, and the premium Prautes desktop tube amplifier. All products are now discontinued and the company appears to be defunct, with no current manufacturing or support operations.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Third-party measurements from Audio Science Review reveal significant performance issues with the Theorem 720. The unit starts to distort early and becomes highly distorted at maximum volume [1]. The noise floor is extremely high with audible constant hiss that persists even at low impedance settings [1]. Output impedance remains acceptable at under 1 ohm [1]. The Trio portable amplifier demonstrates noticeable noise floor issues, particularly with sensitive earphones [2]. The Prautes achieves frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (+0.2dB to -0.75dB) according to manufacturer specifications [3], but lacks independent third-party verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Cypher Labs relied primarily on mature, conventional technologies without significant innovation or proprietary advancements. The Theorem 720 uses the AKM4396 24-bit/192kHz DAC chip [4], while other products employ standard vacuum tube implementations. The Trio uses a single French-made Thomson 6111 tube [5], and the Prautes utilizes vintage NOS RCA 50L6 and Sylvania 12AU7 tubes in push-pull configuration [6]. The company showed minimal integration of modern digital signal processing or software features. Design approaches remained conservative with conventional analog circuits and established tube technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Since Cypher Labs products are discontinued and no longer available for purchase, traditional cost-performance evaluation cannot be conducted as these products are not competing in the current market. Historical pricing information shows the Theorem 720 was priced at approximately 899 USD, the Trio at 599 USD [5], and the Prautes at 3,900 USD [6]. For current users seeking similar functionality, alternatives like the FiiO Q1 Mark II (100 USD) provide superior measured performance with 90dB SINAD and excellent channel matching at 0.025dB deviation [7]. However, as discontinued products, direct cost-performance comparison is not applicable to current purchasing decisions.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

All Cypher Labs products are now discontinued and described as "legacy" items "no longer manufactured" [6]. The company appears defunct with no current support infrastructure, warranty coverage, or parts availability. While the analog construction of tube amplifiers may offer inherent reliability advantages, the complete absence of manufacturer support significantly impacts long-term serviceability and user confidence. Products that fail outside of their original warranty period have no viable repair or replacement options through official channels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The company's design philosophy emphasized craftsmanship and "heirloom" quality, with the Prautes specifically designed as a "statement piece" with "legacy" characteristics [8]. The approach involved producing limited-edition runs to ensure "authenticity and heirloom quality" [8]. Design investments focused on premium materials including vintage NOS tubes, high-end capacitors, and custom components. The philosophy combined technical background (the designer held a graduate physics degree) with artistic sensibility, prioritizing "simplicity, elegance, and accessibility" [8]. However, this approach resulted in products with minimal measurable audio quality advancement relative to their premium pricing.

## Advice

Cypher Labs products are no longer available for purchase due to discontinued status. Historical owners of working units may continue using them while functional, but should prepare for eventual replacement as no repair or warranty services exist. For users seeking portable DAC/amplifier functionality, current alternatives provide superior measured performance with active manufacturer support and significantly lower pricing.
