## Overview

Ayre Acoustics was founded in 1993 by Charles Hansen in Boulder, Colorado, as an American high-end audio manufacturer. The company advocates their "Four Treasures" design philosophy (zero feedback, fully balanced, fully complementary, high-quality power supply) and manufactures preamplifiers, power amplifiers, integrated amplifiers, and DACs. Although founder Charles Hansen passed away in 2017, the company has over 30 years of experience developing products for audiophiles.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Analysis of the AX-5 Twenty integrated amplifier's measurement results shows THD of 0.009% at 1W, which is good, but rises to 0.13% at 100W. SNR of 101dB is below levels achieved by modern amplifiers. The QX-5 Twenty DAC shows THD+N around -110dB in measurements, which is acceptable, but zero-feedback design contributes to distortion increases under load compared to feedback-based modern digital standards. Zero-feedback design does not contribute to improved measurement performance and actually becomes a factor in increased distortion rates.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The company possesses unique circuit design technologies such as Diamond output stages and EquiLock circuits, with technical knowledge based on over 30 years of design experience. Fully balanced configuration and discrete design are technically commendable. However, zero-feedback design is a classical approach that does not contribute to distortion improvement from modern measurement technology perspectives, with limited effectiveness for measurement performance improvement. While they have a track record of providing circuits for Neil Young's PonoPlayer, their technology level remains only slightly above industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Comparing the AX-5 Twenty (12,950 USD) with the Topping PA5 II Plus (325 USD) which has equivalent output and functionality: 325 USD รท 12,950 USD = 0.025, resulting in a 0.0 evaluation. For the QX-5 Twenty (8,950 USD), equivalent DSD512 support and high sampling rate DAC functionality can be achieved with the Topping D90SE (899 USD) or SMSL VMV D1SE (around 800 USD), which match or exceed measurement performance. Similarly, the Codex (1,795 USD) has equivalent DAC/headphone amplifier functionality available for hundreds of dollars, with ASR measurements showing SINAD of 93dB, comparable to lower-cost options. All products have price settings over 10 times higher than equivalent functionality and measurement performance products, resulting in extremely low cost-performance levels.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The warranty period is industry standard, and they have over 30 years of business continuity since their 1993 founding. With headquarters in Boulder, Colorado, they maintain an established repair and support system. Business continues after the founder's passing, showing certain corporate stability. However, specific data on failure rates and MTBF cannot be confirmed, and no notable advantages over emerging manufacturers are evident.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Among the "Four Treasures" design philosophy, fully balanced configuration and high-quality power supplies are rational, but zero-feedback design is irrational from modern measurement technology perspectives. Negative feedback, when properly implemented, is an effective technology that significantly improves distortion and noise rates, and eliminating it worsens measurement performance. The subjective goal of achieving "tube-like sound" lacks scientific basis and deviates from the original goal of transparent sound reproduction. Design approaches dependent on subjective sound quality theories rather than technical innovation toward improved measurement results lack rationality.

## Advice

For those considering Ayre purchases, I recommend careful comparison with equivalent functionality modern design products. If considering the AX-5 Twenty, alternatives with superior measurement performance such as the NAD M33 (5,000 USD) or Topping PA5 II Plus (325 USD) are available at significantly lower prices. For DACs, products like the Topping D90SE (899 USD) or SMSL VMV D1SE (around 800 USD) achieve far superior measurement performance at a fraction of the price. Unless you find special meaning in Ayre's subjective values like "musicality" or "analog sound quality," please recognize that numerous more rational choices exist in terms of both objective sound quality improvement and economic efficiency.
