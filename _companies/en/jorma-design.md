## Overview

Jorma Design is a Swedish high-end audio cable specialist founded by Jorma Koski around 2000. The company hand-manufactures interconnects, speaker cables, power cables, and digital cables, offering a wide price range from the entry-level Trinity series to the flagship Statement series. They employ high-quality materials such as high-purity copper, silver-plated conductors, PTFE/FEP insulation, and various shielding structures and pursue signal transparency. Meanwhile, publicly referenceable third-party measurement publications are limited. With over 20 years of experience, the company has gained support from high-end audio enthusiasts worldwide.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Based on public information, detailed third-party measurement reports (frequency response, THD+N, crosstalk, etc.) specific to Jorma Design cables are not widely available. Detailed disclosure of electrical characteristics such as resistance, capacitance, and inductance is also limited, leaving few materials to quantitatively evaluate objective improvements within the audible range. Marketing claims are present; however, primary numerical evidence and measurement conditions are limited in public sources, and scientific verification remains insufficient.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The technologies employed are typical combinations of high-end materials in the industry: high-purity copper, silver-plated conductors, PTFE/FEP insulation, and aluminum/PET shielding. For digital transmission, impedance control (e.g., 75Ω/110Ω) appears appropriately considered and maintains basic design quality. However, publicly evident proprietary technologies or published technical papers/patents demonstrating dramatic measurement performance improvements are not readily identifiable from public sources. Hand-crafted manufacturing contributes to quality control but does not in itself guarantee technological superiority.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Under the policy definition, CP is calculated as "the lowest globally available price of an equivalent-performance product ÷ the target product price." Jorma Design prices are substantially higher than common alternatives. For line-level interconnects, DIY XLR cables using Mogami 2549 typically cost on the order of several tens of USD in parts, and inexpensive commercial speaker cables exist with comparable basic electrical properties. The price gap often falls well below 1/20, so per policy the CP score is 0.0 (brand value and craftsmanship are excluded from this metric).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a company with over 20 years in business, product supply appears generally stable. Distribution through authorized dealer networks is confirmed, and warranties are available. However, public disclosure of details such as warranty terms, repair systems, and reliability indicators (e.g., MTBF) is limited. Given the nature of cable products, failure risks are likely lower than for electronics, though evidence to assert industry-leading support is insufficient. As a relatively small company, there is some inherent risk concerning long-term continuity.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The basic concept of "adding nothing and losing nothing in signal transmission" is theoretically rational. Adopting high-purity materials, appropriate shielding, and careful control of impedance and capacitance is a reasonable direction. However, public presentation of measurement data or verification methods sufficient to justify extreme pricing is limited, presenting challenges from the standpoint of objective justification. While basic cable functionality appears appropriately addressed, public information alone does not sufficiently substantiate the rationality of very high pricing.

## Advice

Jorma Design products feature high-quality materials and careful manufacturing. However, publicly available third-party measurements substantiating audio-quality improvements commensurate with pricing are limited. For basic electrical characteristics, alternatives such as Mogami and Canare or generic speaker cables are available at much lower cost. When considering purchase, carefully evaluate whether the price difference aligns with subjective satisfaction and ownership. Conduct blind tests and use measurement equipment to objectively assess investment validity. For improvements under limited budgets, we recommend prioritizing speakers or amplifiers where measurable differences are larger.
