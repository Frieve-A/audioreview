## Overview

Scan-Speak A/S is a specialized speaker driver manufacturer established in Denmark in 1970, having received technical recognition in the high-end audio industry for over 50 years. Founded by Ejvind Skaaning, the company continues handcrafted manufacturing with 50 employees in Videbaek, Denmark. The company handles high-end drivers such as beryllium dome tweeters and the Illuminator series, and also provides OEM supply to luxury speaker manufacturers worldwide.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Measured data for Scan-Speak's current beryllium tweeter D3004/664000 shows frequency response characteristics that fall within acceptable ranges for high-end speaker drivers. AudioXpress published detailed THD measurements for related models D3004/604000 and D3004/604010 at 94dB SPL (1m), showing second and third-harmonic distortion measurements across the frequency range. The D3004/664000 utilizes the same beryllium dome platform with similar distortion characteristics. Although the company's products indeed have frequency response above 40kHz, performance improvements beyond human audible range are meaningless from a scientific validity perspective. Compared to modern digital audio technology and built-in drivers of active speakers, no clear superiority is recognized in measurement results.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company's beryllium dome technology uses 99% pure beryllium and employs a unique design with six neodymium magnets arranged in the AirCirc magnetic circuit system. These technologies are highly regarded in the industry, particularly for their originality in dome material selection and magnetic circuit design. Detailed measurement data using LinearX LMS analyzers is also provided, ensuring technical transparency. However, the extent to which these technologies contribute to actual sound quality improvement requires separate evaluation. The design philosophy maintains handcrafted quality control based on 50 years of experience, achieving high technical completion.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scan-Speak's product prices are extremely high, with the D3004/664000 beryllium tweeter currently selling for 378.60-510 euros (approximately 57,000-77,000 yen). Compared to the functionally equivalent SB Acoustics SB29BAC-C000-4 (284.95 euros = approximately 43,000 yen), CP = 43,000 yen รท 70,000 yen = 0.61, rounded to 0.5. These competing products achieve equal or superior performance to Scan-Speak products in basic performance including frequency response, THD, and output level. The company's products do not present measurement data that justifies the price difference in terms of pure performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scan-Speak has 50 years of manufacturing experience and ensures quality consistency through integrated manufacturing at a single Danish factory. However, for product warranty and repair support, individual customers must deal through sales agents, with limited direct support structure. Specific data on failure rates and MTBF are not published. Continuous adoption by high-end speaker manufacturers as OEM suppliers can be evaluated as one indicator of reliability, but specific support quality at the end-user level remains unclear.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The company's handcrafted manufacturing and "uncompromising quality" approach does not necessarily translate to performance improvements backed by measurement data. With competing products utilizing modern CAD design and automated manufacturing technology showing equal or superior measurement results, the necessity of handcrafted manufacturing is questionable. The choice of beryllium material is not necessarily rational considering health risks. Additionally, pursuing frequency response above 40kHz exceeds human audible range and cannot be considered a design philosophy based on scientific evidence. The failure to adopt modern approaches such as digital signal processing technology utilization and low-cost high-performance realization through active crossovers also reduces the rationality of the design philosophy.

## Advice

While Scan-Speak's products certainly possess high technical capability and manufacturing quality, performance improvements commensurate with price are limited from a modern perspective. Particularly for general DIY audio enthusiasts or those considering purchase, we recommend alternative products with equivalent measured performance such as SB Acoustics SB29BAC-C000-4 (38,000-43,000 yen). These products achieve similar performance at approximately half the price. When selecting Scan-Speak products, it is important to conduct objective comparisons based on actual measurement data and confirm that performance differences justify the price difference. Purchase decisions should be based solely on objective measurement data such as THD, frequency response, and S/N ratio, rather than subjective elements like brand image or "handcrafted quality." Additionally, considering active speaker systems could potentially achieve higher cost-performance.
