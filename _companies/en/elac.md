summary: "A veteran German audio equipment manufacturer established in 1926. Known as an innovator in acoustic technology from its founding, particularly as a worldwide pioneer in the development of concentric (coaxial) drivers. In recent years, with the participation of renowned speaker designer Andrew Jones, they have developed a product lineup with excellent cost-performance. One of the few manufacturers that successfully balances technical advancement with accessible pricing."

## Overview

ELAC (Electroacustic GmbH) was established in Kiel, Germany in 1926, making it an audio equipment manufacturer with nearly 100 years of history. Known as an innovator in acoustic technology from its founding, particularly the concentric (coaxial) drivers developed in the 1950s had a major influence on subsequent speaker design. For many years, it has been beloved as synonymous with high-end audio within Germany.

In 2013, Andrew Jones, formerly the principal engineer at TAD (Technical Audio Devices), joined the company and designed numerous acclaimed products including the Debut, Uni-Fi, and Carina series. However, in July 2021, Jones announced his departure from ELAC after six years of success. Currently, Rolf Janke (Head of Research and Development) at the German headquarters handles design, working on new series such as the Solano.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

ELAC's products are thoroughly designed based on scientific measurement data. Particularly in Andrew Jones' designed Debut 2.0 series, optimization of directivity characteristics through spinorama measurements, precise adjustment of crossover frequencies, and control of internal cabinet resonances all show measurable improvement effects. The company's latest flagship Carina FS247.4 achieves excellent measurement values of THD+N below 0.5% and frequency response 20Hz-40kHz within Â±2dB. These figures are confirmed by independent third-party measurements, making their scientific validity clear.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

ELAC's proprietary concentric (coaxial) driver technology demonstrates industry-leading technical capability. The latest JET6 Tweeter in particular evolves Air Motion Transformer (AMT) technology, achieving six times the vibration area of conventional dome tweeters. This enables both ultra-high frequency reproduction up to 40kHz and extremely low distortion characteristics. In Andrew Jones' designed Carina series, a Chinese-made JET tweeter is combined with a 5.25-inch aluminum cone mid-bass driver to achieve a high crossover frequency of 2.7kHz. Currently, under Rolf Janke's design for the Solano series, AS-XR (Aluminum Sandwich eXtended Range) technology develops new composite cone materials using aluminum/paper combinations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ELAC speakers have very competitive pricing for their excellent performance. For example, when compared with products having equivalent measurement performance to the Debut 2.0 B6.2 (approximately USD 520 per pair), such as the Q Acoustics 3000i series or Wharfedale Diamond 12 series, the cost-performance can be evaluated as high, but since it's not the absolute lowest price, the CP score is 0.6. The Carina BS243.4 (approximately USD 800 per pair) shows a similar trend.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Based on the tradition of German manufacturing, quality control provides extremely excellent product reliability. The company's products clear Europe's strict quality standards and are designed to withstand long-term use. The warranty period is typically 5 years, exceeding industry standards, and provides comprehensive after-sales service through authorized distributors in Japan. The parts supply system is particularly excellent, with major components available for procurement even for models over 10 years old. However, some entry-level models are manufactured in China for price control, and these products may show slight quality variations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

ELAC's design philosophy is extremely rational, with a scientific approach based on acoustic engineering consistently applied. Andrew Jones' design philosophy of "matching measurement data with listening experience" is reflected in all company products, with objective data-based improvements continuing without relying on subjective sound quality evaluation. The adoption of concentric (coaxial) drivers also has clear technical justification for achieving acoustic characteristics close to a point source, with effects confirmed through measurement data. Non-scientific "occult" elements are completely eliminated, with rational justification existing for all design decisions.

## Advice

ELAC is one of the few manufacturers that embodies the philosophy of "excellent technology at affordable prices." Particularly Andrew Jones' designed products have very excellent balance between measurement performance and price, making them highly recommended for audio beginners to advanced users alike.

- **Audio beginners**: The Debut 2.0 series is the optimal choice for experiencing genuine acoustic performance at affordable prices. The B6.2 in particular offers surprisingly excellent cost-performance considering its measurement performance.
- **Intermediate to advanced users**: The Carina and Adante series provide technology comparable to high-end speakers at more accessible prices. The ultra-high frequency reproduction capability of the JET6 Tweeter in particular is worth experiencing.
- **Technology-oriented audio enthusiasts**: The company's concentric (coaxial) driver technology offers unique acoustic characteristics that cannot be experienced elsewhere. Worth considering from a technical interest perspective.

ELAC's products, successfully balancing "technical advancement" with "accessible pricing," can be said to be a valuable presence in today's audio market.
