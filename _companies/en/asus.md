## Overview

ASUS is a major Taiwanese computer manufacturer established in 1989, expanding from motherboards into gaming audio products. They develop gaming headsets under the ROG brand and sound cards under the Xonar brand. Their product development is specialized for the gaming market, with the Republic of Gamers brand recognized worldwide. While not an audio equipment specialist, their achievements in the gaming field are notable.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

ASUS audio products demonstrate measurable improvements. The Xonar AE achieves 110dB SNR and 0.00158% THD+N, approaching transparent levels. ROG headsets with 40mm Essence drivers maintain frequency response within 20Hz-20kHz (Â±3dB). However, compared to top-tier audio equipment, even the Xonar Essence STX only achieves 0.0003% THD (line output), falling short of current digital DACs (below 0.0001% THD). AI-powered noise cancellation and similar features show practical improvements within the audible range.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

They employ industry-standard DAC chips including ESS 9023P, Realtek S1220A, and AK4493, achieving above-average technical standards. The Xonar Essence STX achieved 117dB SNR, which was high-performance for its time. The proprietary Essence driver design in ROG headsets and sealed chamber structure for frequency separation are commendable. However, they lack proprietary audio-dedicated chipsets, relying primarily on combinations of existing technologies.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

ROG Strix Go Core (80USD) compared to equivalent gaming performance HyperX Cloud Stinger (55USD) yields CP=55/80=0.69. Xonar SE (40USD) compared to equivalent performance Creative Sound Blaster Play! 3 (25USD) yields CP=25/40=0.63. Xonar AE (65USD) compared to equivalent performance Behringer U-Phoria UM2 (35USD) yields CP=35/65=0.54. ROG Strix Go 2.4 (200USD) compared to equivalent performance SteelSeries Arctis 7 (145USD) yields CP=145/200=0.73. The average CP across major products is approximately 0.6, demonstrating average cost-performance for a gaming-specialized brand. The ROG Strix Go 2.4 particularly offers reasonable pricing considering Nintendo Switch compatibility and wireless functionality. However, specialized audio manufacturers maintain advantages for pure audio quality applications.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

They have established credibility as a major PC component manufacturer with comprehensive global support. The Xonar series continues long-term driver updates with proper Windows 10/11 compatibility. The ROG brand has worldwide recognition with adequate repair infrastructure. However, compared to audio specialists, technical support for audio equipment specifics is limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While gaming-focused design philosophy is partially rational, most elements consist of non-scientific aspects. Many "gaming-specific" differentiation factors lack measurement-based advantages. LED lighting and flashy exterior designs don't contribute to audio quality improvement. Sound card products show no clear advantages over smartphone + external DAC solutions in modern contexts, making their necessity as dedicated audio equipment extremely low. While practical values like low-latency wireless communication and multi-platform compatibility are recognized, overall design philosophy rationality remains limited.

## Advice

While ASUS products are unsuitable for pure audio quality applications, they provide average cost-performance for users prioritizing gaming-specific features. Specialist manufacturers offer superior audio quality at comparable price points, but ASUS becomes a viable option when gaming-specific features (low latency, multi-platform support, gaming DSP) are necessary. The ROG Strix Go 2.4 particularly offers value for users prioritizing Nintendo Switch compatibility and wireless functionality. The ROG Strix Go Core, while more expensive than equivalent gaming performance HyperX Cloud Stinger (80USD vs 55USD), provides superior build quality. Sound cards have limited necessity as dedicated audio equipment since budget USB audio interfaces like the Behringer U-Phoria UM2 (35USD) offer equivalent or superior performance compared to the Xonar AE (65USD). The Xonar SE (40USD) faces competition from the Creative Sound Blaster Play! 3 (25USD) which provides similar functionality at significantly lower cost. Consider whether gaming-specific features are truly necessary before purchasing.
