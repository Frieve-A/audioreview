## Overview

Supra Cables, founded by Tommy Jenving in 1976, represents Swedish engineering excellence in audio cable manufacturing. Based in Ljungskile, Sweden, the company operates under their "No-Nonsense Concept" emphasizing measurement-based design over subjective claims. All products are designed and manufactured in-house, ensuring complete quality control. The company focuses on scientifically rational cable design using proprietary technologies like tin-plated oxygen-free copper conductors and square composition geometry, developed through extensive testing rather than marketing-driven specifications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Supra cables demonstrate proper specifications with resistance and capacitance values within expected ranges for quality audio cables. The Ply 3.4/S achieves 5.1 Ohm/km resistance and 0.20 mH/m inductance, while the EFF-I interconnects maintain 37 Ohm/km resistance and 77 pF/m capacitance [3]. Shielded versions provide >95% EMI/RFI reduction. The oxygen-free copper conductors exceed 99.999% purity standards. While Supra charges premium pricing for proprietary technologies like tin plating and square geometry, these technologies offer measurable electrical improvements in skin effect reduction. However, cables remain a product category with no scientifically audible impact beyond meeting basic electrical specifications. Per policy guidelines for cable category products, base score of 0.5 applies when no specific problems are confirmed with resistance/capacitance specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Supra demonstrates technical sophistication through proprietary innovations developed through scientific research. Their unique tin plating technology addresses skin effect issues through zoned tin plating that progressively increases DC resistance toward the conductor exterior [4]. This approach, chosen over conventional silver plating after extensive testing, produces measurably lower skin effect loss. The square composition design for Ply speaker cables resulted from conductive testing showing superior performance compared to common shotgun and round cable designs [5]. The company holds worldwide patents on shielded mains cable technology under safety approval [4]. These proprietary technologies represent genuine engineering advancement in cable design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Market analysis reveals Supra Ply speaker cables at approximately 20 USD per meter [8]. However, basic OFC alternatives provide equivalent electrical performance at substantially lower costs. Based on current market research, Amazon Basics 12AWG OFC speaker wire (200-foot/61m length) provides equivalent resistance and capacitance specifications at approximately 100 USD for 61 meters, calculating to 1.64 USD per meter [1]. Using current EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.1814 (September 18, 2025) [9], European alternatives like basic OFC speaker cables are available at 6-8 EUR per meter (7.1-9.5 USD per meter). While lacking Supra's proprietary square geometry and tin plating, these alternatives achieve equivalent user-facing functionality and electrical performance for cable applications. The internal construction differences do not change fundamental electrical specifications or user-visible functions. CP calculation: 1.64 USD รท 20 USD = 0.08, rounded to 0.1.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Supra provides 3-year warranty coverage exceeding industry standard 2-year periods. Manufacturing occurs in dedicated Swedish facilities with certified quality staff and military-standard soldering practices [6]. The simple cable construction with few components creates inherently robust designs resistant to degradation. Global distributor network ensures fast delivery within 1-2 weeks for custom orders. In-house production allows direct factory support. The tin plating on OFC conductors provides superior corrosion resistance compared to bare copper. Construction quality benefits from decades of manufacturing experience and established quality control procedures.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Supra's "No-Nonsense Concept" explicitly emphasizes measurement-based design over subjective approaches. The company philosophy rejects "voodoo" claims in favor of established science principles [7]. Design decisions like tin plating selection resulted from measured skin effect performance testing versus silver alternatives. The scientific approach stems from founder Tommy Jenving's engineering background, prioritizing measurable improvements over marketing claims. All proprietary technologies are developed through extensive testing and measurement rather than subjective listening tests. The company explicitly avoids making unsubstantiated audible claims, focusing instead on demonstrable electrical performance improvements. This rational, measurement-first approach represents exemplary design philosophy in the cable industry, even if the practical audible benefits remain scientifically questionable.

## Advice

Supra Cables targets buyers prioritizing engineering-based design philosophy over cost efficiency. While the company maintains exemplary scientific approach to cable design, the substantial price premium (10-12x basic equivalents) provides no audible benefits in typical applications. The proprietary tin plating and square geometry offer measurable electrical improvements, but cables as a product category have no scientifically audible impact beyond meeting basic specifications. Recommended only for buyers who specifically value Swedish manufacturing quality, extended warranty support, and measurement-based engineering approach despite poor cost-performance. Budget-conscious buyers should consider basic OFC alternatives that provide identical user-facing functionality and electrical performance. The scientific design philosophy represents the industry benchmark, but practical purchasing decisions should prioritize equivalent-performing alternatives at fraction of the cost.
