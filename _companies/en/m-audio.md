## Overview

M-Audio (formerly Midiman) is a business division of inMusic Brands that designs and sells music production equipment including audio interfaces, MIDI controllers, synthesizers, studio monitors, and microphones. Since its establishment in 1988, the company has built its market position by offering a wide range of products from entry-level to intermediate users at affordable prices. Currently, M-Audio operates independent offices in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan, maintaining a global presence.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

M-Audio's flagship AIR 192/4 audio interface achieves specifications of 24-bit/192kHz support, 104dB S/N ratio, 0.003% THD+N, and frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz (+0.1dB), demonstrating performance close to the transparent level in our measurement criteria table. The 104dB S/N ratio approaches the transparent level (105dB or higher), and the 0.003% THD+N falls within the transparent range (0.01% or lower). However, even higher-end models like the AIR 192/14 maintain similar basic measurement performance levels, showing no revolutionary technologies that provide clear audible improvements. While Crystal Preamp and MIDAS-lineage circuit designs ensure sufficient measurement performance for the entry-class category, significant performance improvements utilizing the latest digital technologies have not been achieved.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

M-Audio's technology level is positioned at industry average standards. The adoption of Crystal Preamp achieves transparent recording, and low latency (2.59ms) via USB-C is also accomplished, but these represent solid implementations of existing technologies with limited proprietary innovation. The flagship AIR series provides stable 24-bit/192kHz support and MIDI integration functions, but DAC chip and analog circuit selections are conservative, not reaching industry-leading measurement performance levels. In MIDI controllers, products like the Oxygen Pro series and Hammer 88 Pro implement hammer-action keyboards and diverse control functions, but technical advancement remains at equivalent levels to competing products in the same price range. The design philosophy prioritizes practicality and is reasonable, but lacks technical breakthroughs or originality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

M-Audio's cost-performance is inferior compared to competing products with equivalent functionality. Against the flagship AIR 192/4 (approximately 113 USD), competitors offer products with equivalent 2-input/2-output, 24-bit/192kHz support, and similar measurement performance at a lower price. For instance, the Native Instruments Komplete Audio 1 (approximately 39 USD) and the Steinberg UR12 (approximately 49 USD) are strong alternatives. Comparing with their average price of 44 USD: `44 USD ÷ 113 USD ≒ 0.39`. This results in a score of 0.4. In the MIDI controller field, equivalent-function but more affordable options like the Arturia KeyLab Essential series exist, with M-Audio's pricing positioned 2-3 times higher than competing products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

M-Audio provides a one-year product warranty and maintains an international support system with offices in six countries worldwide. As part of inMusic Brands, they operate specialized technical support teams and third-party certified repair center networks, continuing repair services even after warranty expiration. However, some user reviews report issues such as "M-Audio M-Track 2X2M failed after several years" and note that "Behringer and M-Audio are not known for driver quality." Product durability is at industry average levels, but exceptional long-term reliability or low failure rates have not been confirmed. Support response is prompt, and product registration and firmware update systems are well-established, though they do not reach industry-leading reliability standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

M-Audio's design philosophy is generally rational, adopting technical approaches that contribute to measurement performance improvements. The company focuses on technologies directly linked to audible sound quality improvements, including Crystal Preamp's transparency-focused design, low latency achievement via USB-C, and high-resolution recording through 24-bit/192kHz support. The AIR series balances practicality and measurement performance through enhanced connectivity via combo inputs and visual level management with LED VU meters. In MIDI controllers, they prioritize implementing functions necessary for accurate performance expression transmission, such as velocity-sensitive keys and hammer-action mechanisms. However, regarding the raison d'être of dedicated audio equipment, particularly for entry-level products, clear differentiation from high-performance external DACs for smartphones can be challenging. While avoiding occult claims and maintaining scientifically-based design approaches, there is room for improvement in innovation and cost efficiency.

## Advice

M-Audio is worth considering for budget-conscious users, but careful comparison with competing products in the same price range is necessary before purchase. Particularly important is confirming clear reasons for choosing M-Audio products, given the existence of more affordable alternatives with the same 24-bit/192kHz support, such as Native Instruments Komplete Audio 1 (approximately 39 USD) and Steinberg UR12 (approximately 49 USD). While the AIR 192/4's measurement performance approaches transparent levels and provides sufficient performance for beginners' recording environment setup, other manufacturers' products often represent more rational choices from a cost-performance perspective. For MIDI controllers, given the existence of more feature-rich products from Arturia and Novation at similar price points, we recommend considering alternatives unless specific M-Audio features (such as Hammer 88 Pro's hammer action) are essential. For long-term investment considerations, choosing more reliable manufacturers or products with superior cost-performance will ultimately lead to better music production environment quality improvements.
