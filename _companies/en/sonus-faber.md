## Overview

Founded in 1983 in Vicenza, Italy, by Franco Serblin, who was also a furniture craftsman, Sonus faber positions speakers not merely as audio equipment but as "works of art." The company's product line, heavily influenced by the founder's aesthetic philosophy, captivates audio enthusiasts worldwide with handcrafted cabinets using the finest wood materials and Italy's characteristic emotionally rich sound signature.

Even after Franco Serblin's passing in 2013, his design philosophy continues to be carried forward. At CES 2024, the company unveiled a flagship model priced at USD 750,000, demonstrating their continued pursuit of ultimate luxury products. Currently under the McIntosh Group (now Fine Sounds Group) umbrella since 2007, they have accelerated their global expansion. The company positioned 2024 as a "special year," achieving groundbreaking product launches, prestigious awards, and innovative partnerships.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Sonus faber's products embody a design philosophy that prioritizes musical expressiveness over pure measurement performance. For example, their Amati Futura intentionally applies subtle coloration to the midrange frequencies to enhance the beauty of string instrument tones. While this deviates from measurement-based "accuracy," it can be considered to have certain effects from a musical satisfaction perspective. However, such subjective adjustments necessarily receive limited evaluation in terms of strict scientific validity. Recent products have begun to place greater emphasis on objective measurement data, but the pursuit of "beautiful sound" remains a strong influence.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company's woodworking techniques represent world-class standards, with complex curved cabinet manufacturing techniques that remain unmatched by competitors. The solid wood integrated molding cabinets adopted in the Homage Tradition series are masterpieces that achieve both acoustic advantages and aesthetic value. Their proprietary driver units also demonstrate high technical prowess, particularly in natural midrange tone reproduction, which is highly regarded in the industry. In recent years, they have actively incorporated DAW-based acoustic simulation technology, fusing traditional craftsmanship with modern design techniques.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The Sonus faber Amati Futura (USD 36,000) can be compared to products with equivalent measurement performance such as the Bowers & Wilkins 802 D4 (USD 26,000, frequency response 17Hz-28kHz, 90dB sensitivity, low THD). Furthermore, the KEF LS50 Meta (USD 1,600, frequency response 79Hz-20kHz, 84.5dB sensitivity, ±2.1dB deviation, low distortion) achieves equivalent levels in midrange and high-frequency measurement performance. CP = 1,600 ÷ 36,000 = 0.044, which rounds to 0.0, but considering the floorstanding form factor, it is evaluated as 0.1.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Due to the artisanal nature of hand-crafted Italian products, there can be some variation in quality control. However, the quality of materials used is extremely high, and with proper maintenance, products can be used for decades. The warranty period is typically 2 years, and support is provided through authorized dealers in Japan and internationally. However, due to the handcrafted nature of the products, repairs and maintenance can be time-consuming, and sourcing special wood materials and components can sometimes be challenging. Particularly for older models, equivalent repairs may become difficult due to craftsman retirement, as has been reported.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Sonus faber's design philosophy is based on the clear objective of "beautifully reproducing music," making it extremely rational in that regard. The consistent philosophy of prioritizing musical emotion over measurement perfection has been maintained for over 40 years since the company's founding. The approach of applying traditional Italian string instrument crafting techniques to speaker design is acoustically sound and has materialized in the form of natural midrange resonance. Non-scientific elements are virtually absent, and all design decisions have aesthetic and musical foundations.

## Advice

Sonus faber is the optimal choice for users who prioritize "musical beauty" over pure measurement performance. Particularly in reproducing string instruments and vocals, they possess a unique charm unavailable from other manufacturers.

- **For those who value aesthetic appeal**: The company's products hold supreme value as living room interior pieces. The Homage Tradition series, in particular, possesses beauty truly worthy of being called works of art.
- **Classical music enthusiasts**: Particularly in string instrument tone reproduction, Sonus faber products possess expressive capabilities that set them apart from other manufacturers. They demonstrate their true value with chamber music and concertos.
- **Measurement data prioritizers**: For those who emphasize pure measurement performance, other manufacturers' products are recommended. The company's appeal lies in aspects that cannot be expressed through numbers.

Sonus faber products, embodying founder Franco Serblin's philosophy that "music is emotion," will become an irreplaceable presence for those seeking deep dialogue with music.
