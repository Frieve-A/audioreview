## Overview

Elega was the brand name used by Fujiki Electric Co. Ltd., a Tokyo-based Japanese audio equipment manufacturer that operated primarily in the 1970s and early 1980s. The company produced various headphones including the DR-111C, DR-61C, DR-119C, and FR-901C models, as well as microphones such as the DM-303. Elega headphones were characterized by low impedance designs (4-8 ohms typical) suitable for vintage audio equipment of that era. The company ceased operations decades ago, and no trace of Fujiki Electric Co. Ltd. can be found in current markets, making these products available only through vintage audio collectible channels.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Available specifications for Elega headphones are extremely limited, consisting primarily of basic impedance values (4-8 to 60 ohms), frequency ranges without deviation tolerances (18-23,000 Hz for DR-111C, 20-20,000 Hz for FR-901C), and sensitivity measurements (100-105 dB). Critical audio quality parameters are completely unavailable: no frequency response deviation measurements (±dB), no distortion data (THD, IMD), no signal-to-noise ratio specifications, and no crosstalk measurements. No third-party measurement verification exists for any Elega products. According to policy section 199, when credible third-party measurements are unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information, Scientific Validity is set to 0.5 as "unable to evaluate" due to insufficient data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Elega headphones represent standard 1970s analog headphone technology with basic dynamic drivers and conventional construction methods. No proprietary patents, technical innovations, or advanced engineering approaches were identified. The technology is purely analog/mechanical without integration of modern digital processing, advanced materials, or software capabilities. Construction methods and design approaches were typical for the era but offer no competitive advantages by current technological standards. The company showed no evidence of technical expertise accumulation or development of technologies that other manufacturers would want to adopt.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Current vintage market pricing for Elega headphones ranges approximately 50-150 USD [1][3], with representative pricing around 100 USD for evaluation purposes. The Audio-Technica ATH-M20x at 59 USD provides equivalent frequency response range (15-20,000 Hz), comparable impedance (51.1 ohms), adequate sensitivity (113.1 dB SPL), modern construction quality, and manufacturer warranty support that exceeds vintage Elega performance and reliability. Equipped with equivalent frequency response range and modern impedance/sensitivity specifications that meet or exceed vintage Elega performance, plus modern construction and warranty support [4][5]. Third-party measurements confirm superior measured performance across all audible parameters [6][7]. CP = 59 USD ÷ 100 USD = 0.59.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Elega products suffer from complete absence of manufacturer support since Fujiki Electric Co. Ltd. no longer exists. No warranty coverage is available for vintage units, no parts supply infrastructure exists, and no authorized repair services operate. The company manufactured products for only brief periods (FR-901C had just 2 years of sale from 1978-1980), indicating limited production stability even during operation. Reliability depends entirely on individual vintage unit condition, with high risk of component failure due to aging materials and inability to source replacement parts. Customer service and technical support are impossible to obtain.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Elega represented a conservative analog design philosophy typical of 1970s consumer audio without evidence of measurement-based optimization or scientific validation approaches. The company showed no progression toward modern audio engineering principles, no adoption of digital signal processing or advanced technologies, and no integration of scientific measurement verification in product development. Design decisions appear driven by conventional analog approaches rather than objective performance optimization. No evidence exists of cost-effectiveness considerations, as vintage pricing bears no relation to measurable performance improvements. The design philosophy fundamentally lacks rationality from contemporary audio engineering perspectives that prioritize transparent, scientifically validated performance, with no technical justification for audio-specific equipment when general-purpose alternatives offer superior measured performance.

## Advice

Elega headphones should be considered purely as vintage collectibles rather than functional audio equipment. Modern budget headphones like the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x offer superior performance, reliability, and support at approximately 59% the cost of vintage Elega units. For users seeking authentic 1970s audio experiences or vintage equipment compatibility, ensure thorough condition inspection before purchase, as no warranty or repair options exist. The low impedance designs (4-8 ohms) may be suitable for vintage amplifier matching, but modern alternatives provide equivalent functionality with measurable performance advantages and ongoing manufacturer support.
