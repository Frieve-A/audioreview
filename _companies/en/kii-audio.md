## Overview

Kii Audio is an advanced active speaker manufacturer based in Germany. The company's CTO, Bruno Putzeys, is the developer of the Hypex NCore Class-D amplifier technology currently adopted in many high-end active speakers and amplifiers, and is also the designer of the highly acclaimed Grimm Audio LS1 monitor. His colleagues have also held senior positions at companies such as Digidesign, TC Electronic, Grimm Audio, and SSL, representing veterans of the professional audio industry. The company's flagship product, the Kii THREE, has made it possible to significantly reduce the adverse effects of room acoustics that were unavoidable with conventional speakers through its unique cardioid directivity technology and Active Wave Focusing.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Kii Audio's products demonstrate excellent measurement performance. The flagship Kii THREE achieves outstanding nominal frequency response specifications of 20Hz-25kHz ±0.5dB, with Hi-Fi News measurements showing ±2.1dB from 300Hz-20kHz and ±1.1dB below 12kHz. Total harmonic distortion (THD) clears the transparent level at 0.1% at 1kHz, while pair matching shows remarkable precision of ±0.8dB from 300Hz-20kHz and ±0.3dB below 15kHz. Particularly noteworthy is the cardioid directivity control achieved from 1kHz down to above 50Hz, which represents a scientifically proven effect for reducing room acoustic influences. Such measurement performance positions the products at world-class levels that significantly exceed transparent thresholds.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Kii Audio develops industry-leading proprietary technologies. The Active Wave Focusing technology is a revolutionary design that controls the relative phase and timing of drivers placed on the front, sides, and rear to achieve cardioid directivity across the full frequency range. Each speaker incorporates six drivers, each driven by dedicated 250W Ncore Class-D amplifier modules. Crossover, time alignment, and phase equalization are all processed via DSP, with built-in room boundary correction functionality. This technology achieves full-range cardioid control that was previously considered impossible, dramatically improving independence from listening rooms. The comprehensive design combining Bruno Putzeys' NCore technology represents extremely advanced technology that other companies would desire.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The Kii THREE (system approximately 2,100,000 JPY) can be compared against the Dutch & Dutch 8C (approximately 2,500,000 JPY) as a competitive product with equivalent cardioid directivity and DSP correction functionality. When comparing products with the important user feature of cardioid directivity, the calculation yields 2,500,000 JPY ÷ 2,100,000 JPY = 1.19, but this is clamped to 1.0. This means the Kii THREE is the most affordable among speakers with equivalent cardioid functionality. Cardioid directivity control is an important feature that significantly reduces room acoustic influences, making comparisons with conventional active speakers lacking this functionality inappropriate. In comparisons of equivalent functionality, Kii Audio achieves excellent cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While Kii Audio is a relatively new company, it possesses a solid technical foundation from industry veterans. The technical reliability is considered high due to experienced engineers led by Bruno Putzeys. However, the company's track record is limited compared to established manufacturers like Genelec or Adam Audio. Specific information regarding long-term product reliability data and failure rates is limited, requiring future track record accumulation as an emerging manufacturer. Warranty periods and support systems are at industry standard levels, but the comprehensiveness of global service networks falls short compared to established manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Kii Audio's design philosophy is extremely rational. The company addresses the fundamental problem of adverse effects that listening room acoustic characteristics have on speaker performance through the scientific approach of cardioid directivity. Active Wave Focusing technology represents a practical solution based on physical acoustic principles, with its effectiveness demonstrated through measurement results. The design combining six drivers with individual amplifiers and DSP represents a rational approach that directly contributes to sound quality improvement both theoretically and practically. The room correction functionality that significantly reduces installation environment constraints represents excellent design philosophy addressing realistic needs. The technical development approach based on actual physical phenomena and measurement results rather than marketing exaggeration deserves high evaluation.

## Advice

Kii Audio is a manufacturer that has presented a scientific solution to room acoustic problems that were difficult to solve with conventional speakers through the revolutionary innovation of cardioid directivity technology. The technology level is industry-leading, and measurement performance shows excellent results that significantly exceed transparent levels. The true value will be demonstrated particularly in situations where acoustic treatment of listening environments is difficult or where installation locations are constrained. While the price is in the high range of approximately 2.1 million JPY, it achieves excellent cost-performance compared to competitive products with equivalent cardioid functionality. Cardioid directivity control is an important feature that significantly reduces adverse room acoustic effects, providing unique value with no alternative means for users requiring this technology. When considering purchase, it is recommended to thoroughly evaluate the necessity of cardioid effects in your listening environment and consider the investment value in this innovative technology.
