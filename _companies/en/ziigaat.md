## Overview

ZiiGaat is a Shenzhen-based brand that transitioned from 10+ years of OEM/ODM work to a consumer lineup. The catalog spans **hybrids** (Arcanis, Cincotres, Odyssey, Cinno), a **single-DD** entry (Nuo), a **pure-BA** model (Luna), and collaborations (Arcadia/Arete/ESTRELLA). Official listings show **Crescent 279 USD, Luna 379 USD, Arcanis 399 USD, Odyssey 229 USD, Cinno 69 USD** on the site[6][10]. In the ultra-budget tier, Nuo appears at **23.20 USD** at retail[4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Independent data remain limited but include **Cincotres** FR on an IEC-711 clone coupler (with the usual >10 kHz caveat)[1]. **Arcanis** is a **2DD+5BA** hybrid with **dual-DD isobaric loading**, **~9 dB at 20 Hz**, and **THD 0.42%** listed as **manufacturer specs**[2]. **Odyssey** lists **1DD+3BA (Knowles RAF 32873 ×2 / RAD 33518)**, **THD 0.05%**, and **20 Hz–23 kHz** as **manufacturer specs**[3]. The scarcity of cross-model third-party distortion/unit-variance data keeps the score moderate.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Designs emphasize solid, established topologies: isobaric dual-DD for sub-bass headroom (Arcanis) and a Topology DD + Knowles BAs (Odyssey) with multi-way passive crossovers[2][3]. Execution looks competent; novelty is modest.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Computed from two representative models (equal weight), using the cheapest equal-or-better alternatives.**

- **Cinno (69 USD):** We could not find a **cheaper** equal-or-better set; **TRUTHEAR HEXA (89.99 USD)** is widely measured and costs more → **CP = 1.0**[4][9].  
- **Arcanis (399 USD):** **Moondrop Blessing 3 (359.99 USD)** serves as the lower-priced benchmark at a similar performance tier → **CP = 359.99 USD ÷ 399 USD ≈ 0.9**[2][7].

**Company CP (average)** = (1.0 + 0.9)/2 ≈ **0.95 → 1.0** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Published policies include a **1-year IEM warranty**, **3-month cable warranty**, **30-day** sealed returns (buyer pays return shipping), and a **7-day opened return with 35% restocking**[5]. The consumer track record is young; long-term reliability data are still limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Studio-balanced tunings and driver allocation are reasonable, but greater transparency—especially broad third-party measurements—would strengthen claims on low distortion and sub-bass output[1][2][3].

## Advice

In the **200–400 USD** range, **Odyssey (229 USD)** and **Arcanis (399 USD)** are natural in-house picks[2][3]. Externally, **Blessing 3 (359.99 USD)** remains a strong reference competitor to Arcanis[7]. For entry buyers, **Cinno (69 USD)** is aggressive for its configuration, while **Nuo (23.20 USD)** is among the cheapest viable options—though waiting for more third-party data is prudent[1][4].
