## Overview

Founded in China by Fang Bian in 2007, HiFiMAN played a revolutionary role in popularizing planar magnetic headphones. Before this company, planar magnetic headphones were limited to ultra-luxury models costing thousands of dollars, but HiFiMAN achieved planar magnetic headphones in the hundreds of dollars range through proprietary technological innovation.

Particularly noteworthy are the company's "Stealth Magnet" technology and "Nanometer Diaphragm" technology. These significantly improved the traditional challenges of planar magnetic designs regarding weight and efficiency issues, with the Sundara achieving a lightweight 372g. They now offer planar magnetic headphones across a wide price range, from the entry-level HE400se to the top-tier Susvara and HE1000 series.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The basic scientific advantages of planar magnetic drivers can be confirmed. The Sundara's (approx. USD 299) THD+N performance of 0.2% or less is superior compared to dynamic driver products in the same price range. Additionally, the Susvara (approx. USD 6,000) achieves extremely excellent THD+N of 0.05% or less. However, the company's claims about "nanometer-level diaphragms" have an unclear correlation with actual audible effects, showing strong marketing elements. Variations in measurement performance between products are also a challenge.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

They lead the industry in mass production technology for planar magnetic drivers. The "Stealth Magnet" technology in particular is a proprietary technology that minimizes acoustic wave interference by optimizing magnet placement, solving traditional planar magnetic problems. Diaphragm technologies like "Nanometer Diaphragm" and "NEO Supernano Diaphragm" are also excellent technologies that achieve both weight reduction and high rigidity. However, there are large technological gaps between upper and lower models, with clear differentiation in technology investment according to price.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The cost-performance is rated extremely high. The company's core products, the HE400se (approx. USD 109) and Sundara (approx. USD 299), have no rivals with comparable performance in their price ranges, giving them a CP score of 1.0. This price disruption has greatly contributed to the popularization of planar magnetic headphones. In contrast, high-end models like the Susvara (approx. USD 6,000) face competition from more affordable rivals like the Meze Empyrean II (approx. USD 2,999), resulting in a divided evaluation with a CP of approx. 0.5 (USD 2,999 รท USD 6,000). However, considering the immense value offered by their mainstream entry-to-mid-range products, the company as a whole receives a high score.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Quality control challenges cannot be denied. Particularly, the initial defect rate is higher than other companies, with cable breaks and driver malfunctions reported. The warranty period is 1 year, which is industry standard, but there are variations in repair service response speed and quality. However, they have been working to improve quality in recent years, with improved stability in products from the Edition XS onwards. Community information sharing is also active, with user-to-user problem solving.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company's design philosophy is extremely rational. They continue technological innovation to maximize the physical advantages of planar magnetic drivers while reducing manufacturing costs. The "Stealth Magnet" technology in particular is an acoustically sound design based on scientific principles. They also provide clear technological differentiation at each price point, offering performance appropriate to price. There are few occult elements, with support from technical papers.

## Advice

HiFiMAN products are suitable for those who want to experience planar magnetic headphones or seek high cost-performance. However, it's important to understand quality control challenges before purchasing.

- **For Planar Magnetic Beginners**: We recommend starting with the HE400se or Sundara. You can experience the characteristic sound quality of planar magnetic technology at affordable prices.
- **For Intermediate Users and Above**: Edition XS and Ananda are excellent choices providing near-flagship performance at mid-price ranges.
- **For Advanced Users**: Susvara, the HE1000 series, and the Arya series are suitable for those seeking the highest level of planar magnetic headphones, though prices are correspondingly high.

We recommend always auditioning before purchase. It's also important to choose retailers with solid return/exchange policies, considering the possibility of initial defects. Despite quality control challenges, their technological innovation and price disruption continue to have a major impact on the entire audio industry.
