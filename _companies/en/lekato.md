## Overview

LEKATO is an R&D oriented company founded in 2019, developing wireless guitar systems and headphone amplifiers. Based in China with research center, the company produces WS-70 UHF wireless system, WS-100 2.4GHz system, and PA-1 multi-effects headphone amplifier.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Limited third-party measurement data available. WS-70 manufacturer specifications claim THD <0.05%, S/N ratio >86dB, latency <3ms, frequency response 20-20kHz [2]. PA-1 shows problematic 10KΩ output impedance vs <100Ω standard [2]. WS-70 meets acceptable performance criteria, while PA-1 has output impedance issues.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Competent implementation of contemporary wireless and digital technologies. Products use 24-bit/48kHz processing, UHF/2.4GHz transmission, IR loading, Bluetooth, USB connectivity. Standard implementation without significant innovation or proprietary patents.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

LEKATO's flagship WS-70 at 39.99 USD represents the company's most competitive offering. Market analysis reveals the Getaria 2.4GHz system at 40 USD offering similar core wireless guitar transmission functionality, but with significantly inferior latency performance (12ms vs 3ms) - a 400% performance degradation well outside acceptable equivalence criteria. While the Getaria provides superior dynamic range (>105dB vs >86dB), the substantial latency difference disqualifies it as an equivalent-or-better alternative per evaluation policy. The WS-70 represents the most affordable option achieving sub-5ms latency performance combined with professional UHF frequency band operation and 70-channel capability, making it the cheapest equivalent option with CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Below-average support infrastructure. 12-month warranty vs 2-year standard. Problematic customer service: requires YouTube videos, denies issues, expensive China shipping costs [3]. Founded 2019, lacks reliability track record. Email-only support limits accessibility.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Measurement-focused approach using 24-bit/48kHz digital processing without occult claims. Emphasizes cost optimization and accessibility. R&D orientation suggests scientific approach, but innovation remains conservative. Rational focus on contemporary digital technologies.

## Advice

LEKATO offers budget wireless systems and headphone amplifiers for practice applications. WS-70 provides 70-channel UHF capability with manufacturer specifications meeting acceptable performance criteria. PA-1 delivers multi-effects functionality but has output impedance issues. Consider customer service limitations. For professional applications, invest in alternatives with established measurement data and reliable support. Test thoroughly within return periods.
