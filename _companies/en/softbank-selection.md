## Overview

SoftBank SELECTION operates as an Internet-first brand for multi-category smartphone accessories, founded in 2008. The company markets audio products under the GLIDiC brand, which operates under the slogan "Sound for people on the move," positioning itself as a mobile-oriented audio specialist. Their flagship GLIDiC TW-9100 True Wireless Earbuds represent the culmination of their audio expertise, featuring hybrid Knowles balanced armature and dynamic driver configurations with adaptive active noise cancellation. The company's audio portfolio spans 107 products across categories including wireless earphones, wired earphones, headphones, microphones, and audio accessories, distributed through SoftBank stores and online channels.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The GLIDiC TW-9100 lacks comprehensive measured data for objective audio quality assessment. While the company claims frequency response extending "past 10kHz" and calibration to the "Knowles Preferred Listening Response Curve," no actual THD, S/N ratio, or frequency response deviation measurements are publicly available. Third-party measurement data is also absent. Due to insufficient measurement data, Scientific Validity cannot be evaluated and is set to the default value of 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

SoftBank SELECTION demonstrates solid contemporary technology implementation in their flagship GLIDiC TW-9100. The product features in-house design combining Knowles balanced armature drivers with dynamic drivers, creating a desirable hybrid configuration that other manufacturers would want to adopt. The implementation includes adaptive hybrid active noise cancellation, AI noise reduction for calls, and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity. However, when evaluated against current 2026 state-of-the-art standards, the technology shows gaps compared to leading competitors that now offer Bluetooth 6.0, advanced AI processing algorithms, superior codec support (aptX Lossless, LDAC), and latest ANC implementations. The GLIDiC product relies on older Bluetooth standards and limited codec support (AAC/SBC only) compared to competitors implementing cutting-edge connectivity and processing technologies. While the company doesn't possess proprietary patent technology (relying on Knowles components), their design expertise shows appropriate integration of audio technologies that were cutting-edge for 2025 standards. The hybrid driver approach represents a technically sophisticated solution for achieving extended frequency response, though competitive advantage duration is moderate as similar configurations are becoming more common in the premium true wireless segment.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. At 218.80 USD, the GLIDiC TW-9100 faces significant cost-performance challenges. The EarFun Air Pro 4+ at 99.99 USD MSRP offers equivalent-or-better functionality including advanced ANC, Bluetooth 6.0 with multipoint connectivity, and superior codec support (aptX Lossless, LDAC vs AAC/SBC). ANC performance is equivalent-or-better. Cost-performance calculation: CP = 99.99 USD ÷ 218.80 USD = 0.5. The GLIDiC product commands a substantial premium without demonstrable performance advantages, making it difficult to justify the price differential for consumers seeking optimal value.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

SoftBank SELECTION benefits from the established SoftBank ecosystem's support infrastructure, providing global presence and manufacturer-backed service. The company offers standard warranty coverage with accessible customer support through SoftBank's established channels. While specific failure rate data isn't available, SoftBank's long-standing presence in the Japanese market since 2008 suggests adequate reliability track record. The GLIDiC product line uses conventional earbud construction without unusual complexity that would increase failure risk. Support infrastructure includes direct manufacturer service rather than dealer-only support, and SoftBank's corporate resources provide reasonable assurance of ongoing parts availability and repair services during typical product lifecycles.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

SoftBank SELECTION's design philosophy shows mixed rationality in execution. The TW-9100 represents progression over previous models with contemporary features like adaptive ANC and multipoint connectivity. However, the company's approach suffers from audibility claims for high-frequency benefits without clear scientific evidence. The cost allocation analysis reveals significant inefficiency: at 218.80 USD vs. comparable alternatives at 99.99 USD, the majority of costs do not directly contribute to function and measurement performance improvement, appearing concentrated in brand positioning and carrier distribution rather than measurable audio improvements. The majority of the price differential lacks correlation with demonstrable performance advantages over mass-produced alternatives with equivalent functionality.

## Advice

For consumers considering SoftBank SELECTION/GLIDiC audio products, focus primarily on their established support ecosystem rather than premium pricing. The GLIDiC TW-9100's hybrid driver technology and feature set are competent but not exceptional relative to current market alternatives. Those prioritizing brand reliability and domestic support may find value, particularly users already within the SoftBank ecosystem. However, performance-focused buyers should consider alternatives like the EarFun Air Pro 4+ which offer equivalent functionality at significantly lower cost. The lack of published measurement data makes it difficult to verify audio quality claims, so audition before purchase is recommended. SoftBank SELECTION products work best for mobile-focused users who value integration convenience over pure cost-performance optimization.
