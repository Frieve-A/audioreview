summary: "Norwegian high-end audio manufacturer Hegel claims proprietary SoundEngine technology, but actual measurements show performance significantly below expectations. Particularly, DAC measurements rank in the bottom 7 out of 350 products tested, lacking scientific justification for premium pricing."

## Overview

Hegel is a Norwegian high-end audio manufacturer established in 1988. Their main products include integrated amplifiers, DACs, power amplifiers, and preamplifiers, featuring proprietary SoundEngine2 technology for distortion reduction. They offer products ranging from the H95 (2,000 USD) to the H600 (13,800 USD), sold worldwide including Japan. While established as a high-end audio brand, scientific verification reveals significant concerns.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

AudioScienceReview measurements of the H95 revealed extremely poor DAC performance, ranking in the bottom 7 out of 350 products tested. THD+N performance is essentially equivalent to a 9 USD smartphone dongle, unacceptable for a 2,000 USD product. While the amplifier section achieves 80 SINAD, the outdated USB input limitation to 96kHz is also confirmed. The H120 and H190 reportedly use similar DAC circuits, falling far short of transparent performance levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The SoundEngine2 feedforward error correction technology shows originality, claiming high damping factors exceeding 4000. However, measured data reveals significant discrepancies between theory and results. While the amplifier design demonstrates certain technical competence, the failure to meet basic technical requirements in DAC implementation is serious. Higher-end models like H390 and H590 reportedly use different DAC circuits, but technical compromises in lower-tier models are evident.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Cost-performance is the most problematic aspect. Comparing the H95 (2,000 USD) with the Fosi Audio V3 (110 USD) offering equivalent or superior functionality and performance: 110 USD รท 2,000 USD = 0.055, corresponding to 0.1. The Fosi V3 demonstrates excellent measurements with THD 0.003% and SNR 110dB, clearly superior to Hegel's DAC performance. Even for higher-end models, equivalent functionality products remain available at substantially lower prices.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Hegel provides a 2-year product warranty and has established support systems through authorized dealers in Japan and globally. However, warranty coverage is limited to the purchase region. As an established Norwegian manufacturer, reasonable reliability can be expected, but no exceptional support systems or extended warranties are offered as added value. Performance remains at industry-standard levels.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While pursuing the correct direction of transparent sound quality, actual products show results lacking scientific foundation. The theoretical explanations of SoundEngine technology are convincing, but measured data fails to support these claims. Particularly in lower-tier models, DAC implementation falls significantly below current digital technology standards, revealing serious gaps between design philosophy and implementation. Rational technical advantages justifying premium pricing cannot be confirmed.

## Advice

Those considering Hegel purchases are strongly advised to conduct detailed comparisons with alternative products in the same price range. Particularly for the H95, H120, and H190, products like the Fosi Audio V3 and SMSL SA300 exist at one-tenth the price with equivalent or superior measured performance. If choosing Hegel brand products, limit selection to H390 and above models with different DAC implementations, and mandatory verification of third-party measured data is recommended. Objective measurement data-based selection is crucial rather than brand image considerations.
