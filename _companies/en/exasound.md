## Overview

Exasound is a Canadian audio company specializing in the design and manufacture of high-end DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converters). Founded in 2008, the company has developed a product lineup featuring ESS Technologies' Sabre DAC chips. Their range includes the s88 Streaming DAC and multi-channel models like the e32/e38/e62/e68, featuring DSD512 and MQA decode capabilities in high-price segments. They have obtained Roon Ready certification and adopt a design philosophy emphasizing network streaming functionality.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Audio Science Review measurements of the Exasound e32 revealed measurement issues with unbalanced output, showing results inadequate for the price point. While balanced output improves 2nd harmonic distortion by 6dB, it still fails to reach transparency levels. Despite claiming ESS ES9038PRO chip adoption, implementation technology fails to deliver expected performance, falling significantly below the measurement baseline transparency levels (THD 0.01% or below, SNR 105dB or above). Multi-channel support and DSD512 compatibility do not compensate for the fundamental measurement performance deficiencies.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The company employs ESS Technologies' ES9038PRO with proprietary ASIO drivers and FPGA firmware implementing 32-bit low-jitter signal processing. USB isolation technology and Roon Ready certified high-quality network streaming functionality demonstrate technical value. They achieved early industry implementation of 8-channel DXD and DSD256 support. However, implementation technology shows limitations in translating DAC chip performance into actual measurement results, with insufficient optimization in circuit design and power supply sections. While technical specifications are advanced, the efficiency of technology investment in actual performance remains low.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Against the s88 Streaming DAC's 6333 USD, a combination of the higher-performing Topping D90SE DAC (400 USD) and the versatile Wiim Pro Plus streamer (200 USD) is available for a total of about 600 USD. Calculation: 600 USD รท 6333 USD = 0.09, which rounds to 0.1. Similarly, for the e32 and e38 models, ES9038Q2M-equipped DACs like the SMSL D6S (167 USD) and Topping E50 (267 USD) provide equivalent or superior measurement performance at significantly lower costs. Multi-channel support is also achievable through a PC + multi-channel DAC combination, offering no price advantage as dedicated equipment.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The company maintains direct support from Canadian headquarters with continuous firmware updates. They provide industry-standard 3-year warranty periods, and Roon Ready certification ensures long-term software compatibility. However, domestic repair systems in Japan are limited, potentially requiring overseas shipping. Due to the small company size, there are concerns about future support continuity, and reliability/support systems remain at average levels compared to major corporations.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

There are irrational aspects in investing development resources into scientifically meaningless features like DSD512 and MQA support. DSD shows no superiority compared to latest multibit DACs, and MQA lacks scientific basis. Conversely, Roon Ready network streaming integration and USB isolation technology represent rational approaches. However, the development policy prioritizing feature additions over basic measurement performance improvement is problematic. The strategy of setting high prices for dedicated equipment with functions replaceable by general-purpose devices (PC + high-performance DAC) also lacks rationality.

## Advice

Purchasing Exasound products is not recommended. Against the s88's 6333 USD price point, the combination of a Wiim Pro Plus (200 USD) and a Topping D90SE (400 USD) delivers a superior measurement performance and a more flexible system for a total of about 600 USD. As Audio Science Review measurements demonstrate, the price and performance are severely misaligned, with no scientific basis for justifying the purchase. Sound quality improvements commensurate with the high investment cannot be expected, and more rational alternatives are strongly recommended. Avoid being misled by features like DSD or MQA, and make informed decisions based on measurement data.
