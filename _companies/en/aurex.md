## Overview

Toshiba has revived the Aurex brand for compact, convenience-first audio products. The headline model for our readers is the AX-RP10, a wireless belt-drive record player designed and supported for the Japanese domestic market only (explicitly not for overseas use/service)[1]. This review concentrates on the AX-RP10 as the brand’s current turntable while acknowledging Aurex also offers other portable audio devices.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

With no independent lab results available yet, we rely on manufacturer specs. The AX-RP10 claims wow & flutter ≤0.2%, S/N ≥60 dB (JIS-A), 3.5 g ±0.5 g tracking force, and a 109 mm die-cast aluminum platter[1]. Wireless output uses SBC/LC3 only (Bluetooth 5.4)[1]. These figures prioritize portability and ease of use over state-of-the-art transparency, so audible fidelity is expected to be limited versus modern non-portable front ends.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Implementation is conventional but tidy: belt drive, MM cartridge (ATN3600LC), auto-stop and arm lifter, USB-C charging, and ~10 hours playback from a 2,000 mAh internal battery[1]. LE Audio (LC3) support and compact mechanical packaging are practical, yet overall represent incremental engineering rather than category-leading innovation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

For USD basis, we reference a global retail listing at **220 USD** for the AX-RP10[2]. The closest rival is Audio-Technica’s Sound Burger (AT-SB727) at **199 USD**, specified at S/N >50 dB (DIN-B) and wow & flutter <0.25% (3 kHz, WTD)[3][4]. Because these specs are **not** equal-or-better than the AX-RP10’s published values, no cheaper product with equivalent-or-better functionality and performance was identified; therefore CP is set to **1.0** by rule.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Support expectations align with typical Japanese market consumer electronics. However, the AX-RP10 is explicitly domestic-only (overseas use and after-service not provided)[1], and long-term reliability data are not yet available given the product’s recency.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design rationally targets “vinyl on the go” scenarios: compact size, straightforward operation, and wireless output[1]. As a fidelity-first tool it is inherently compromised, but as a convenience device the trade-offs are coherent and do not promote pseudo-scientific claims.

## Advice

Buy the AX-RP10 if you prioritize casual, portable vinyl playback with minimal setup and wireless output. If record preservation and transparency are your top goals, a non-portable turntable with lower tracking force and more robust mechanics is the better path. The AT-SB727 remains a fun portable alternative, but based on published figures it does not surpass the AX-RP10 in core performance metrics[3][4].
