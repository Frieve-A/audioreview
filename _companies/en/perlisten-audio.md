## Overview

Perlisten Audio is an American speaker manufacturer established in 2016. They design in Verona, Wisconsin, and manufacture in China. Key members include Daniel Roemer and Lars Johansen. The company offers flagship S-series and mid-range R-series products, incorporating proprietary DPC-Array technology and TPCD carbon fiber drivers.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Perlisten Audio products show good measured performance. The S7t achieves THD below 0.5%, frequency response of 22Hz-37kHz (-10dB), and 117dB SPL. For speakers, THD at 0.5% is good (excellent below 0.1%), with flat response within ±3dB. Third-party measurements (Audioholics, Erins Audio Corner) confirm low non-linear distortion and flat frequency response, providing scientifically audible sound quality improvements. The R5t delivers stable performance with 89dB sensitivity and 4 ohms minimum impedance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company's technical standards exceed industry averages. DPC-Array achieves directivity control through three 1-inch dome tweeters, improving vertical dispersion. TPCD carbon fiber drivers are 30% lighter than conventional while enhancing strength. Beryllium dome and cast frame designs contribute to measured performance improvements. However, similar approaches exist at other companies, not reaching industry-leading levels. The design philosophy rationally links to measured results.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Perlisten Audio products hold a mid-tier position compared to equivalents in measured performance. The S7t (3,300,000円 / 22,000USD) compares to the Revel F328Be (2,640,000円 / 17,600USD) with similar measurements (low THD, flat FR, high SPL), yielding 17,600÷22,000=0.8. For the R5t (1,200,000円 / 8,000USD), the Arendal 1723 Tower (555,000円 / 3,700USD) offers equivalent performance, yielding 3,700÷8,000=0.46. Averaging both contributes to the overall mid-level cost-performance at 0.5 after adjustment.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As an emerging company, long-term reliability records are accumulating. Products are manufactured in China for cost reduction, but quality control details are unclear. Warranty is standard, with a one-year extension via online registration, though official support in Japan is not clearly established and relies on distributors. Support levels are industry-average, with uncertainties typical of new manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Perlisten Audio's design philosophy rationally emphasizes measured performance improvements. TPCD carbon fiber and DPC-Array technologies directly contribute to low distortion and flat response. Measurements approach transparency levels, but the R-series pricing raises some questions given lower-cost equivalents. Overall, the measurement-focused direction is appropriate.

## Advice

Perlisten Audio produces products with excellent measured performance, particularly the S7t with low THD and high SPL for audible improvements. The S7t's 3,300,000円 (22,000USD) is reasonable compared to the Revel F328Be (2,640,000円 / 17,600USD), but for the R5t at 1,200,000円 (8,000USD), equivalents like the Arendal 1723 Tower exist at half the price (555,000円 / 3,700USD), requiring careful consideration for R-series. Objective measurement comparisons are recommended; opt for S-series for peak performance or competitors for cost focus.
