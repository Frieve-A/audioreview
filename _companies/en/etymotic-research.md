## Overview

Etymotic Research is an acoustic engineering research, development, and manufacturing company founded in 1983 by audiologist Dr. Mead Killion in Illinois. "Etymotic" means "true to the ear" in Greek, and the company is dedicated to hearing protection, hearing testing, and enhancing musical enjoyment.

The company developed the world's first noise-isolating high-fidelity earphone ER-4 in 1991. This balanced armature-equipped model became the foundation of the in-ear earphone category. Currently, they continue to provide acoustic characteristics based on Diffuse Field response with the ER2 (USD 100), ER3 (USD 167), and ER4 (USD 300) series. The ER20 series (USD 13) hearing protection earplugs achieve uniform attenuation characteristics across all frequency bands and are adopted throughout the music industry.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The company's products employ acoustic engineering design based on scientific evidence. The ER-4's isolation performance of 35-42dB exceeds the typical 26dB of custom IEMs. The ER2SE achieves frequency response based on Diffuse Field characteristics, guaranteeing left-right channel matching within 1dB in the 100Hz-10kHz range. Dr. Killion holds 80 papers, 20 book chapters, and over 100 patents, with research achievements in psychoacoustics, acoustics, and transducer technology reflected in their products. Hearing protection products achieve uniform attenuation characteristics across all frequency bands.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company was first to apply balanced armature technology to consumer earphones. The ER4 series maintains left-right channel matching within 1dB, with each product accompanied by individual performance certificates. The ER2 series uses high-performance dynamic drivers. The ER4 series is manufactured in the United States. They have achieved sound quality preservation technology in hearing protection products.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Other products with equivalent measured performance (THD, frequency response, sensitivity) to the ER2SE (USD 100) are available for USD 60, resulting in CP = USD 60 รท USD 100 = 0.6. Balanced armature type IEMs with equivalent performance to the ER3SE (USD 167) are sold for USD 100, yielding CP = USD 100 รท USD 167 = 0.6. Products with equivalent precision matching and analytical characteristics to the ER4SR (USD 300) are available for USD 180, resulting in CP = USD 180 รท USD 300 = 0.6. While the company's products possess technical superiority and high quality, their pricing is relatively high compared to performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company has over 40 years of acoustic engineering research experience with proven adoption in medical and professional fields. They provide left-right 1dB matching guarantee and individual performance certificates for the ER4 series. They have consulting experience with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and lecture activity records in 19 countries. The ER-4 has been in continuous production for over 30 years since its 1991 launch. After-sales service structure is maintained within the United States, but overseas support is limited compared to major manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company's design is based on scientific evidence in audiology and acoustic engineering. Under the corporate philosophy of "true to the ear," they pursue sound reproduction faithful to the original source by eliminating sound coloration. They adopt tuning based on Diffuse Field characteristics. The 35-42dB isolation is designed to prevent sound quality degradation from external noise. Hearing protection products adopt a medical and acoustic approach that preserves frequency characteristics while protecting hearing. Dr. Killion's academic background is reflected in product design, with no unscientific elements included.

## Advice

They provide a product lineup suitable for analytical and reference applications.

- **Hearing Protection Products**: ER20XS (USD 13) provides NRR 13dB, practical attenuation of approximately 20dB, with uniform attenuation characteristics across all frequency bands.
- **Entry Model**: ER2SE (USD 100) features Diffuse Field characteristics and dynamic driver adoption.
- **Mid-Range**: ER3SE (USD 167) adopts balanced armature drivers.
- **Flagship**: ER4SR (USD 300) provides left-right 1dB matching guarantee with individual performance certificates.

The company's products feature flat frequency response based on Diffuse Field characteristics. We recommend prior consideration of compatibility between intended use and design philosophy.
