## Overview

Myburgh Audio is a German high-end microphone manufacturer founded by South African producer and engineer Andrew Myburgh, now based in Berlin. The company collaborates with renowned microphone experts Andreas Grosser and Eckehard Dux, leveraging decades of vintage microphone restoration experience. Myburgh Audio specializes in creating original large-diaphragm tube condenser microphones, including their flagship M1 model and the newer M28 FET-based microphone. The company follows a traditional German approach to high-end microphone manufacturing, producing hand-built units in Berlin at a limited production rate of approximately 10 units per month. Previously operating under the name Burg Microphones, the company has repositioned itself as Myburgh Audio while maintaining its focus on creating microphones that build upon classic vintage designs without directly copying existing models.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The M1's performance evaluation relies primarily on manufacturer specifications due to limited availability of comprehensive third-party measurements. The self-noise specification of 15dBA positions the microphone between the transparent level (below 10dB-A) and problematic level (20dB-A or above), placing it closer to the problematic threshold for professional recording applications. Maximum SPL handling of 124dB exceeds the problematic level (120dB) but remains well below the excellent level (140dB). While the manufacturer claims linear frequency response from 20Hz-20kHz, specific deviation measurements (±dB) from independent third-party sources are not available for verification, limiting the reliability of frequency response evaluation. Sensitivity of 24mV/Pa falls within standard professional microphone ranges. Given the reliance on manufacturer specifications without independent verification, significant uncertainty exists regarding actual measured performance, warranting conservative evaluation pending third-party measurement data [1][2].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Myburgh Audio demonstrates strong technical expertise through collaboration with internationally recognized vintage microphone experts Andreas Grosser and Eckehard Dux. The company employs custom-designed audio and power transformers manufactured by Pikatron, along with proprietary circuitry that differs from vintage templates of the 1940s and 1950s. The M7 Thiersch Elektroakustik Mylar capsule represents high-quality German engineering, recreating classic capsule designs with modern materials. The solid brass body construction and Russian military-grade tubes indicate attention to component quality and electromagnetic interference mitigation. However, the purely analog approach without integration of modern digital processing, software control, or advanced signal processing technologies limits the overall technology advancement score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The Myburgh M1 is priced at 6,495 USD. Equivalent functionality and dramatically superior measured performance can be achieved with the Rode NT1 5th Generation at 226 USD. The Rode NT1 5th Generation provides dramatically superior self-noise performance (4dBA vs 15dBA), superior maximum SPL handling (142dB vs 124dB), and equivalent frequency range (20Hz-20kHz). CP = 226 USD ÷ 6,495 USD = 0.035 → 0.0 (rounded to 1 decimal place). The extreme price premium of the Myburgh M1 compared to functionally equivalent alternatives with dramatically superior measured performance results in exceptionally poor cost-performance, with buyers paying approximately twenty-nine times more for dramatically superior measured performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Myburgh Audio emphasizes robust construction with solid brass bodies and simple tube designs inherently resistant to degradation. The company claims their microphones are "built to last a few lifetimes," indicating focus on mechanical longevity far beyond typical modern microphones. Hand-manufacturing in Berlin with limited production of approximately 10 units per month suggests careful quality control processes. New equipment comes with a minimum 1-year manufacturer warranty, with some retailers extending coverage to 2 years. The simple analog circuitry with fewer electronic components reduces potential failure points compared to complex digital systems. However, as a relatively new manufacturer, long-term reliability data and comprehensive global support infrastructure remain unestablished.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Myburgh Audio's design philosophy centers on vacuum tube technology and traditional analog approaches, which conflicts with scientifically rational audio engineering principles. Despite claims of linear frequency response and low noise performance, the fundamental choice of tube technology inherently introduces compromises in measured performance compared to modern solid-state alternatives. The company invests heavily in custom components, handcrafted construction, and premium materials that significantly increase costs without corresponding improvements in measurable audio performance parameters. The conservative approach of building upon vintage designs rather than embracing modern digital signal processing, software control, or cost-effective semiconductor solutions demonstrates resistance to technological advancement. While the company avoids direct copying of existing designs, the philosophical commitment to analog-only approaches and premium pricing without clear performance justification indicates an irrational design philosophy focused on traditional aesthetics rather than scientifically optimized audio reproduction.

## Advice

Myburgh Audio microphones target professional recording engineers and producers seeking vintage-inspired tube sound characteristics and premium build quality. Potential buyers should carefully consider whether the extreme price premium of 6,495 USD provides value compared to functionally equivalent alternatives with dramatically superior measured performance available at 226 USD. The M1 may appeal to professionals who prioritize traditional craftsmanship, limited production exclusivity, and the specific tonal characteristics associated with tube circuitry, despite exceptionally poor cost-performance ratios. Studios with substantial budgets seeking distinctive microphone options for specific artistic applications may find value in the M1's unique design and construction quality. However, rational purchasing decisions based on measured performance and cost-effectiveness would strongly favor equivalent alternatives that provide dramatically superior specifications at dramatically lower prices.
