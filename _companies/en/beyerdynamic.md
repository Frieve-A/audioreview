summary: "A veteran German audio equipment manufacturer founded by Eugen Beyer in Berlin in 1924. As a company that embodies the quality and reliability of 'Made in Germany,' it is widely supported by professionals and audiophiles alike. The DT 770/880/990 series in particular has been loved for over 40 years as a long-selling model. The combination of innovative driver design using proprietary 'Tesla technology' with magnetic flux density exceeding 1 Tesla, and the craftsman spirit that continues to insist on manual assembly, creates unique acoustic characteristics that cannot be imitated by other companies."

## Overview

A veteran German audio equipment manufacturer founded by Eugen Beyer in Berlin in 1924. Starting with speaker development for movie theaters, the company now handles a full range of audio equipment from microphones to headphones. The company's flagship DT 770/880/990 series has been manufactured for over 40 years since its debut in the 1980s without changing its basic design, and this consistent manufacturing philosophy has captivated many fans.

The headquarters are located in Heilbronn, Germany, and many products are still assembled by hand in Germany today. The company is characterized by technical innovation, such as its proprietary "Tesla technology" with magnetic flux density exceeding 1 Tesla, and replaceable cable designs that enhance practicality in professional settings. In recent years, they have also expanded their lineup with more modern tuning in products like the T1/T5 series and TYGR series.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company's products have clear characteristics in measurement data. The powerful magnetic circuit using Tesla technology enables more efficient diaphragm drive than conventional magnetic circuits, which is objectively measurable as reduced distortion and expanded dynamic range. Additionally, monitor headphones like the DT 770 Pro have acoustic characteristics that withstand long hours of use in studios, with their practicality proven in professional settings. However, the high-frequency emphasis seen in some products, while clearly apparent in measurements, tends to divide preferences.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Tesla technology can be considered the engine demonstrating the company's technical superiority. By generating a stronger and more uniform magnetic field compared to conventional magnetic circuits, it improves diaphragm control. This is a theoretically sound approach, and in actual products, it has resulted in achieving both powerful bass and precise highs. Additionally, the removable cable design adopted in many models not only enhances practicality for professional use but also contributes to extending product life. The handmade assembly process is also an important element in maintaining consistent quality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

While the company's products are priced relatively reasonably for German-made products, they may fall short in pure performance-to-price ratio compared to recent Chinese manufacturers and major brand products. However, the unchanging design philosophy and manufacturing quality for over 40 years provide value beyond mere performance comparison. Particularly when considering long-term parts supply and comprehensive repair services, they often have an advantage in total cost. The stability of value in the used market is also one factor that improves actual cost-performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Inheriting the tradition of German manufacturing, the company's products boast extremely high reliability. Professional models like the DT 770 Pro are known for maintaining performance over long periods even in harsh usage environments. The supply system for consumables is also comprehensive, with replacement parts such as ear pads, headband cushions, and cables available for extended periods. The support system both domestically and internationally is well-established, with very high user satisfaction regarding repairs and maintenance.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company's design philosophy is extremely rational, strongly reflecting the tradition of German industrial design that emphasizes functional beauty. The fact that the basic design has remained unchanged for 40 years means that the initial design was highly accomplished. The adoption of Tesla technology is also the result of a scientific approach to pursuing better acoustic performance, making this a company with very few irrational elements. Recent T1/T5 series and TYGR series also reflect research results in modern acoustic tuning, demonstrating flexibility beyond mere adherence to tradition.

## Advice

Beyerdynamic products are ideal for users who value "German-made reliability." They are particularly ideal choices for users who want to use the same product for a long time and care for it through maintenance.

- **For Beginners to Intermediates**: We recommend starting with the DT 770 Pro (closed-back) or DT 880 Pro (semi-open). These products will help you understand the characteristics of the company's acoustic tuning.
- **For Professionals**: The DT 770 Pro is adopted as standard monitor headphones in many studios. Its proven track record guarantees reliability in professional settings.
- **For Audiophiles**: The T1 and T5 series are suitable for those seeking more refined tuning and premium finishes.

Whichever product you choose, Beyerdynamic products have the quality to be lifelong companions. We strongly recommend them to those who want to enjoy music over the long term without being influenced by trends.
