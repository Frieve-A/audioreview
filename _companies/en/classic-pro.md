## Overview

Classic Pro is Sound House's house brand established as a private label line of professional audio equipment. Founded by the Japanese audio equipment distributor Sound House in 1994, Classic Pro focuses on providing affordable alternatives to mainstream professional audio gear. The brand encompasses headphones, mixers, microphones, and various studio accessories targeting budget-conscious users in recording and live sound applications. As an OEM-based operation, Classic Pro sources equipment from various manufacturers and rebrands it under their label to achieve aggressive pricing through Sound House's distribution network.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Classic Pro headphones demonstrate mixed scientific performance based on available measurements. The CPH7000 monitor headphones achieve a frequency response of 10-30,000 Hz with 64Ω impedance and 108 dB/mW sensitivity, which meets basic professional requirements but lacks detailed specification disclosure for critical parameters like THD and SNR [1]. The CPH3000 shows 10-22,000 Hz response with 18Ω impedance and 112dB sensitivity, indicating adequate but unremarkable performance. No comprehensive third-party measurements for THD, SNR, or crosstalk are publicly available for systematic evaluation. While the products function adequately for basic monitoring applications, they do not demonstrate exceptional measured performance that would justify high scientific validity scores compared to reference-level equipment with documented transparent-level specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Classic Pro operates primarily as an OEM rebranding operation with minimal in-house technical development. Products utilize standard dynamic driver configurations without proprietary innovations or advanced engineering solutions. The company relies on existing designs from contract manufacturers rather than developing unique technologies. Construction follows conventional approaches using common materials and assembly methods typical of budget audio equipment. No evidence of patents, technical papers, or breakthrough designs exists in their portfolio. The technology level represents basic functional implementations rather than cutting-edge audio engineering, positioning Classic Pro as a cost-reduction focused operation rather than a technology leader.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Classic Pro achieves strong cost-performance via aggressive pricing. As a representative example, the CPH7000 closed monitor headphones are listed at 40 USD on the official store [1]. As an equal-or-better comparator, Audio-Technica ATH-M40x is a widely accepted studio monitor headphone, currently 109 USD on Amazon US [2]. At the time of access, no cheaper equal-or-better finished product was identified; therefore CP = 1.0 (clamped by definition). Note: Where third-party measurements for the target are unavailable, this comparison is provisional and explicitly based on manufacturer specifications for the target model.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Classic Pro products receive standard consumer electronics warranty coverage through Sound House's retail network. Quality control varies given the OEM sourcing model, with some products demonstrating adequate durability while others show typical budget equipment limitations. Sound House provides customer service in Japanese markets but international support remains limited. No comprehensive failure rate data or MTBF specifications are published. The company's relatively recent establishment and private label nature provide limited long-term reliability track record. Support infrastructure exists primarily through the parent company's retail operations rather than dedicated technical support channels specific to Classic Pro products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Classic Pro's design philosophy emphasizes cost reduction and pragmatic functionality. The company prioritizes price competitiveness and uses conventional audio technologies rather than pursuing cutting-edge engineering or transparent-level performance. Products generally meet basic expectations for audio equipment without making non-scientific or occult claims, and there is no evidence of irrational design directions. However, limited investment in R&D and measurement-driven optimization means the brand is not actively advancing scientifically meaningful audible improvements. Overall, this places the design philosophy around an average level of rationality.

## Advice

Classic Pro serves users requiring basic professional audio functionality at minimum cost. Consider this brand when budget constraints are primary concern and basic monitoring or mixing capabilities suffice. The products provide entry-level access to professional audio tools without premium performance expectations. However, users seeking reference-level accuracy, advanced features, or long-term reliability should consider established manufacturers with documented measurement performance and dedicated R&D investment. Classic Pro functions adequately as temporary or backup equipment while building toward higher-performance professional audio systems.
