## Overview

Gustard is a Chinese audio equipment manufacturer primarily focused on DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) and headphone amplifier products. The company's product lineup includes delta-sigma models such as the X30, A26, and A18 series, as well as the R2R ladder-type R26, all featuring high-resolution audio support and streaming capabilities. They utilize high-performance DAC chips including ESS ES9039SPRO (quad-mono configuration in X30) and AKM AK4499EX, achieving measurement performance close to transparency levels.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Gustard's product lineup demonstrates excellent measurement performance approaching transparency levels. The X30 achieves THD+N ≤0.0001%@1kHz with SNR >129dB, the R26 delivers THD+N ≤0.003%@1kHz with SNR >122dB, and the A18 reaches THD+N <0.00015%@1kHz with SNR >126dB. Frequency response is well-controlled at 20Hz-20kHz ±0.2-0.6dB, while crosstalk measures -129dB to -139dB providing adequate channel separation. These figures fall within the transparency level range of the measurement criteria table, offering meaningful audio quality improvements for human hearing. However, even their flagship models don't achieve complete transparency level performance, preventing a perfect score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The company demonstrates effective utilization of industry-standard high-performance DAC chips in their designs. The X30's quad-mono ES9039SPRO configuration, R26's discrete R2R ladder design, and A18's AK4499EX implementation all represent rational implementations aligned with current technological standards. Technical considerations contributing to measurement performance improvements include independent linear power supplies, dedicated ground designs, and OCXO clock adoption. However, these represent combinations of existing technologies without unique innovations or groundbreaking approaches that lead the industry. While demonstrating above-average technical implementation capabilities, they don't reach the highest industry standards.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

In price comparisons with competing products offering equivalent measurement performance, Gustard products are at a significant disadvantage. For example, the X30's (approximately 3,000 USD) equivalent transparency level performance can be achieved with the SMSL SU-10 (899 USD). Calculation: 899 USD ÷ 3,000 USD = 0.30, rounded to 0.3. Even more affordable alternatives like the SMSL D6S (199 USD) and Topping E30 II (149 USD) provide practically sufficient transparency performance, resulting in even lower cost-performance when compared to these options. The mid-range A26 (1,500 USD) can similarly be replaced by SMSL products, indicating overall low cost-performance levels.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a Chinese audio manufacturer, they appear to maintain standard reliability and support systems. While detailed information about warranty periods and repair systems is limited, basic support is provided through major distributors. Firmware update support for products with streaming capabilities appears to be implemented as needed. However, with insufficient information about failure rates and long-term quality track records, and being in the phase of building experience as an emerging manufacturer, this warrants an industry-average level evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Gustard's design approach is, for the most part, rational and based on scientific evidence. Its focus on improving measurable performance indicators like THD+N and SNR to achieve transparency is commendable. However, the company also offers products based on the older R2R architecture, which tends to have inferior measurement performance compared to modern delta-sigma designs. This choice is not entirely rational from a high-fidelity perspective. Considering that competitors achieve similar performance at a lower cost, there is room for improvement in its rationality, including pricing.

## Advice

When considering Gustard products, we strongly recommend a detailed comparison with competing products from SMSL and Topping. While they demonstrate excellent measurement performance approaching transparency levels, multiple alternatives exist that can achieve equivalent performance at significantly lower costs. For pure audio quality improvement, selecting competing products with superior cost-performance is a wiser decision. Regarding the R2R-based R26, there is no scientifically proven sonic advantage to this architecture. However, it can be an option for those specifically seeking a product with this technology, but it is crucial to recognize that numerous delta-sigma DACs with superior measured performance exist in the same price range.
