summary: "A Chinese DAC and headphone amplifier manufacturer founded in 2008. Through a measurement-focused design philosophy, they achieve ultra-low distortion performance at astonishingly low prices—performance previously achievable only in expensive price ranges. Products like D10s, L30, and A90 deliver THD+N below 0.0001% at prices of USD 100-200, overturning audio industry conventions. While subjective sound quality evaluations vary, their objective performance-to-price ratio overwhelmingly surpasses other manufacturers."

## Overview

Founded in China in 2008, Topping revolutionized the audio industry with a clear design philosophy of "measurements are everything." Specializing in DAC and headphone amplifier development from early founding, they successfully achieved ultra-low distortion performance measured by Audio Precision test equipment at prices previously unimaginable.

Their greatest characteristic is thoroughly measurement-focused design. While achieving industry-leading levels in all measurement categories including THD+N (Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise), SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and crosstalk, prices remain less than 1/10th of conventional products. The D10s (USD 100) achieving THD+N 0.00006% and A90 (USD 200) achieving THD+N 0.00004% represent performance levels that until recently required products costing tens of thousands of dollars.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company's products possess scientifically valid effects clearly proven by measurement data. The D10s (USD 100) performance of THD+N 0.00006% and SNR above 125dB represents excellent figures well below human audibility thresholds. The L30 (USD 133) output impedance below 0.1Ω also provides scientific advantages in headphone matching. All measurements are verified by third-party institutions (Audio Precision), ensuring data reliability. However, correlation between measurements and subjective sound quality evaluation remains debated.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

They achieve industry-leading levels in the mid-price range for measurement optimization technology. Through artistic OPA implementation techniques, power supply noise countermeasures, and PCB layout optimization, they achieve measurements approaching theoretical limits. Their technology utilizing latest DAC chips like AK4499, ES9038PRO, and CS43198 with circuit designs that maximize chip performance deserves recognition. However, subjective sound quality aspects (soundstage, instrument texture) not reflected in measurements have room for improvement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Topping stands overwhelmingly superior in measurement-to-price cost-performance. No other manufacturer's products achieve equivalent THD+N 0.00006% to the D10s (USD 100), making D10s the world's cheapest, resulting in CP = USD 100 ÷ USD 100 = 1.0. For the A90 (USD 200), no products with equivalent measured performance exist, making CP = USD 200 ÷ USD 200 = 1.0. The DX3 Pro+ (USD 133) also represents the world's cheapest for equivalent functionality and performance, with other manufacturers' products costing above USD 533, resulting in CP = USD 133 ÷ USD 133 = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Quality control demonstrates high manufacturing precision evidenced by measurement stability. Initial defect rates are below industry average with small product variations. The 2-year warranty period exceeds industry standards, and repair services are prompt. However, domestic support structure in Japan is limited, sometimes requiring English communication. Additionally, rapid product update cycles tend to result in early parts supply discontinuation due to model changes.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The "measurements are everything" design philosophy is extremely rational from an audio engineering perspective. Measurements like THD+N, SNR, and crosstalk are scientifically established objective sound quality indicators, making their prioritization logical. The approach of eliminating unnecessary decoration to control costs while investing only in performance-critical areas is also rational. There are no occult elements, with all design decisions based on measurement data. However, consideration for sound quality elements not reflected in measurements (spatiality, instrument texture) is limited.

## Advice

Topping products are optimal choices for those prioritizing objective high sound quality and emphasizing cost-performance. Understanding their measurement-focused design philosophy is important for appropriate product selection.

- **Measurement-focused Users**: Combinations of D10s, L30, and A90 can build systems with measurement-wise highest standards.
- **Beginners**: Starting with integrated products like DX3 Pro+ and E30 is recommended. High performance can be experienced conveniently.
- **Advanced Users**: Top-tier models like A90D and d90LE provide measurement-wise currently available highest performance.

When purchasing, understand that they suit those prioritizing objective performance over subjective sound quality aspects (soundstage, instrument texture). They also suit those emphasizing simple functionality without seeking extra features. For those wanting to judge sound quality by objective measurement indicators, these represent unparalleled choices.
