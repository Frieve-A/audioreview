summary: "A Chinese DAC and headphone amplifier manufacturer founded in 2008. Through a measurement-focused design philosophy, they achieve ultra-low distortion performance at astonishingly low prices. While their objective performance-to-price ratio is overwhelming, quality and reliability issues have been reported on some products, warranting caution."

## Overview

Founded in China in 2008, Topping revolutionized the audio industry with a clear design philosophy of "measurements are everything." Specializing in DAC and headphone amplifier development from early founding, they successfully achieved ultra-low distortion performance measured by Audio Precision test equipment at prices previously unimaginable.

Their greatest characteristic is thoroughly measurement-focused design. While achieving industry-leading levels in all measurement categories including THD+N (Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise), SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and crosstalk, prices remain less than 1/10th of conventional products. The D10s (USD 100) achieving THD+N 0.00006% and A90 (USD 200) achieving THD+N 0.00004% represent performance levels that until recently required products costing tens of thousands of dollars.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The company's products possess scientifically valid effects clearly proven by measurement data. The D10s (USD 100) performance of THD+N 0.00006% and SNR above 125dB represents excellent figures well below human audibility thresholds. The L30 (USD 133) output impedance below 0.1ฮฉ also provides scientific advantages in headphone matching. All measurements are verified by third-party institutions (Audio Precision), ensuring data reliability. However, correlation between measurements and subjective sound quality evaluation remains debated.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

They achieve industry-leading levels in the mid-price range for measurement optimization technology. Through artistic OPA implementation techniques, power supply noise countermeasures, and PCB layout optimization, they achieve measurements approaching theoretical limits. Their technology utilizing latest DAC chips like AK4499, ES9038PRO, and CS43198 with circuit designs that maximize chip performance deserves recognition. However, subjective sound quality aspects (soundstage, instrument texture) not reflected in measurements have room for improvement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Topping stands overwhelmingly superior in measurement-to-price cost-performance. No other manufacturer's products achieve equivalent THD+N 0.00006% to the D10s (USD 100), making D10s the world's cheapest, resulting in CP = USD 100 รท USD 100 = 1.0. For the A90 (USD 200), no products with equivalent measured performance exist, making CP = USD 200 รท USD 200 = 1.0. The DX3 Pro+ (USD 133) also represents the world's cheapest for equivalent functionality and performance, with other manufacturers' products costing above USD 533, resulting in CP = USD 133 รท USD 133 = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Quality control issues have been reported on some products, raising concerns about reliability. Problems appearing to stem from design flaws, such as the static electricity issue with the L30 headphone amplifier and failures in the PA5 power amplifier, are widely known in the community. The warranty period is one year, which is standard for the industry, but with no official service centers in many countries, repairs require going through distributors or shipping back to China, making support limited. The rapid product cycle is also a concern for long-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The "measurements are everything" design philosophy is extremely rational from an audio engineering perspective. Measurements like THD+N, SNR, and crosstalk are scientifically established objective sound quality indicators, making their prioritization logical. The approach of eliminating unnecessary decoration to control costs while investing only in performance-critical areas is also rational. There are no occult elements, with all design decisions based on measurement data. However, consideration for sound quality elements not reflected in measurements (spatiality, instrument texture) is limited.

## Advice

Topping products are optimal choices for those prioritizing objective high sound quality and emphasizing cost-performance. Understanding their measurement-focused design philosophy is important for appropriate product selection.

- **Measurement-focused Users**: Combinations of D10s, L30, and A90 can build systems with measurement-wise highest standards.
- **Beginners**: Starting with integrated products like DX3 Pro+ and E30 is recommended. High performance can be experienced conveniently.
- **Advanced Users**: Top-tier models like A90D and d90LE provide measurement-wise currently available highest performance.

When purchasing, understand that they suit those prioritizing objective performance over subjective sound quality aspects (soundstage, instrument texture). They also suit those emphasizing simple functionality without seeking extra features. For those wanting to judge sound quality by objective measurement indicators, these represent unparalleled choices.
