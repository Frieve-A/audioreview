## Overview

eSseCi Design is an Italian company founded in 1999 by Silvano Cremonesi. Its Relaxa platforms use shielded neodymium magnets to float a tempered-glass shelf above a base, targeting very low-frequency vibration isolation (quoted 4–8 Hz depending on load) and supporting components from roughly 3 kg to 50 kg [1][2]. Japan distributor materials specify eight magnets and a 50 kg maximum load, with domestic pricing historically around 185,000–203,500 円 for Relaxa 750 [2]. UK media list a two-year warranty and 4–8 Hz isolation, and reported a price of £1,495 at time of test [1]. The brand focuses on high-end isolation accessories rather than electronics.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The platform aims to reduce structure-borne vibration (quoted isolation 4–8 Hz) [1]. However, there are no controlled blind/ABX results or third-party acoustic measurements demonstrating audible improvements at the listener’s ear for turntables or electronics. Subjective reports exist, but catalog claims have not been corroborated by independent data linking the platform to measurable transparency gains (FR/THD/SINAD/SNR) in real playback chains. For analog record playback specifically, claims of “soundstage/clarity” improvements remain unverified; thus scientific validity is rated very low.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Positives: in-house mag-lev structure (tempered glass, shielded neodymium magnets), long production history, careful mechanical execution [1][2]. Negatives: technology is mechanical/analog only and largely unchanged since its late-1990s origin; there is no active feedback, DSP, or modern control integration. As a technology package in 2025, this is mature rather than cutting-edge.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better):** IsoAcoustics **Delos 1815M1** platform (finished turntable/compo platform using IsoAcoustics isolators; NRC lab testing published for the company’s isolation mechanisms) at **399.99 USD** street price [3][4].  
**Target price (EN uses USD):** Relaxa 750 **≈ 1,981 USD** (converted from **1,699 EUR** at the ECB reference rate on 2025-08-29) [1][5].

**Calculation (display rule):** 399.99 USD ÷ 1,981 USD = **0.20** → rounded to **0.2**.

*Equivalence note:* Delos provides the same user-facing function (component isolation platform) and publishes NRC-based measurement evidence for its isolation approach [4]; size/capacity variants exist, but function and documented isolation performance are at least equivalent for typical hi-fi components [3][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The passive mechanical design (tempered glass shelf, magnet assemblies) has few failure modes. UK review material lists a two-year warranty, consistent with typical accessory coverage [1]. Long market presence is a positive, but global service infrastructure and formal warranty terms are not clearly documented online; support appears distributor-centric [2].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

The company’s development direction centers on expensive mechanical isolation for analog playback without controlled evidence of audible transparency gains. Emphasis on premium materials and presentation is not matched by rigorous, published listening tests or system-level measurements tied to hearing thresholds. In 2025—when DSP/active control solutions and measured, lower-cost platforms exist—this philosophy is weak as a sound-quality improvement strategy.

## Advice

If vibration issues are measured in your setup (e.g., footfall on suspended floors under a turntable), address them first with placement/rack changes. For an isolation platform, consider IsoAcoustics Delos as a far cheaper option with published lab testing [3][4]. Choose eSseCi only if you value its design and have validated, component-specific isolation needs that cheaper platforms cannot meet.
