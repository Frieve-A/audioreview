## Overview

Acustik Lab (formerly Acustik-Lab G. Schneider) is a Swiss audio equipment manufacturer founded in 1984. The company was historically known for producing loudspeakers, particularly the Bolero series that received coverage in Stereophile in the late 1980s [1][2]. Currently, there is extremely limited market presence and no clearly available current product lineup, which makes the brand effectively inactive in today's audio market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Based on Stereophile’s measurements and specifications of the SR Bolero [1][2], the product demonstrated competent engineering for its era. Reported figures include frequency response of 50Hz–19kHz (±3dB), sensitivity 90dB/W/m, and nominal impedance 4 ohms. Nearfield assessment showed –6dB low-frequency extension of approximately 48Hz for the Bolero satellite and 32Hz for the Forte woofer when combined [1]. These values meet standard expectations for a compact two-way system, though not exceptional by modern transparent-level criteria.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Acustik Lab utilized standard industry approaches including off-the-shelf drive units and conventional crossover design typical of the time. The SR Bolero’s crossover frequency was approximately 3kHz [2]. There is no evidence of recent proprietary R&D or modern product development beyond historical offerings.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Using the SR Bolero’s documented price of 1580 USD per pair (1989) [2] as the review target baseline, and selecting the cheapest current equal-or-better option strictly from a user-facing performance perspective, a valid comparator is JBL Stage A130 at approximately 299 USD per pair in the US market with comprehensive third-party CTA‑2034 measurements [3]. Equivalence note: two-way bookshelf design; on-axis bandwidth and maximum output appropriate for small rooms; modern unit achieves comparable or better measured linearity when EQ is applied, and offers current availability. Calculation: 299 USD ÷ 1580 USD = 0.189 → 0.2 (rounded to one decimal place).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

There is no clear evidence of active customer support, warranty coverage, or service availability for current or legacy products. Stereophile lists the US distribution as “no longer available (2018)” [2]. Historical build quality appeared adequate based on professional coverage, but present-day support infrastructure appears effectively non-existent.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The historical approach demonstrated rational engineering decisions including appropriate driver selection, reasonable crossover frequencies, and conservative design parameters for compact two-way systems. However, the absence of modern product development and market engagement limits the continued application of rational, measurement-driven improvements.

## Advice

Potential buyers should avoid Acustik Lab products due to effective market withdrawal and lack of support infrastructure. Historical products may appear on used markets but carry significant risks regarding parts availability, service support, and warranty coverage. For similar performance characteristics in compact two-way speakers, contemporary alternatives from established manufacturers (e.g., KEF, Monitor Audio, JBL) offer better cost-performance, active support, and modern engineering improvements.
