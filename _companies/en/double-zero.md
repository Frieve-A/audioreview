summary: "Celebrity-branded headphone company launched by DJ-producer Zedd in 2017, featuring the Double Zero 001 closed-back headphones engineered by Onkyo. While claiming wide frequency response of 10Hz-80kHz with carbon paper driver technology, third-party measurement data exists but lacks target curve comparison data necessary for proper headphone evaluation, representing poor cost-performance against established competitors. The design philosophy emphasizes subjective aesthetics over measurement-driven development, resulting in questionable value proposition for audio-focused consumers."

## Overview

Double Zero is a headphone brand launched in 2017 by multi-platinum, Grammy-winning artist-DJ-producer Zedd in collaboration with design team SF, Inc. The company's flagship product, the Double Zero 001, features engineering by Japanese manufacturer Onkyo and targets both audiophiles and electronic music fans.

The 001 model represents the company's sole known product, featuring newly developed 40mm carbon paper drivers with claimed 10Hz-80kHz frequency response. Originally positioned at 199.99 USD but with limited current availability through third-party retailers, the headphones emphasize aesthetic design and celebrity branding over measurement-driven performance optimization, reflecting a consumer-focused rather than professional audio development approach.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurement data for the Double Zero 001 is publicly available on 0db.co.kr, with frequency response measurement results confirmed [4]. However, for headphone frequency response evaluation, deviation from target curves (such as Harman Target) should be assessed rather than raw measurement values. The published measurement data represents raw frequency response without target curve comparison data necessary for proper sound quality evaluation. Additionally, measurement data for other critical audio quality parameters including THD, S/N ratio, and dynamic range is insufficient, making scientific evaluation inadequate with the available information.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The Double Zero 001 employs a newly developed 40mm carbon paper driver unit enabling the claimed wide 10Hz-80kHz frequency range, representing technical advancement in driver material technology. The collaboration with Onkyo, a manufacturer with extensive acoustic engineering expertise, provides access to sophisticated audio engineering capabilities. While representing an OEM collaboration rather than proprietary in-house development, the carbon paper driver technology demonstrates material innovation beyond conventional dynamic drivers. The lack of proprietary patents and limited evidence of technical approaches other manufacturers would adopt results in average technology level assessment.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Double Zero 001 (199.99 USD) provides closed-back design, detachable cable, and claimed 10Hz-80kHz frequency response. The Audio-Technica ATH-M40x (97.77 USD) offers equivalent closed-back design with 15Hz-24kHz frequency response, 35 ohm impedance, and detachable cable functionality [2]. The ATH-M40x provides comparable closed-back design with equivalent 32-35 ohm impedance range for similar amplifier compatibility, detachable cable convenience, and frequency response coverage encompassing the entire audible spectrum (15Hz-24kHz), delivering equivalent user functionality for professional monitoring applications. Equipped with closed-back design, equivalent low-impedance characteristics for portable device compatibility, comprehensive audible frequency range coverage, and detachable cable convenience, the ATH-M40x provides equivalent user functionality at significantly lower cost. CP = 97.77 ÷ 199.99 = 0.49.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Double Zero demonstrates limited support infrastructure with unclear warranty coverage and discontinued production status since the 2017 launch, with current availability limited to third-party retailers. The celebrity-branded nature raises questions about long-term manufacturer commitment and parts availability for long-term support. The closed-back dynamic design with robust construction provides inherent mechanical reliability, and Onkyo's engineering backing suggests quality manufacturing standards. However, the absence of established service networks and discontinued status creates reliability concerns compared to traditional audio manufacturers with dedicated support systems.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Double Zero's design philosophy combines subjective aesthetic considerations with technical engineering through Onkyo collaboration. Zedd's stated goal of creating headphones that "sound real and exciting and look modern yet timeless" reflects consumer market positioning that values both performance and design appeal [3]. While prioritizing aesthetic appeal and celebrity endorsement, the partnership with Onkyo's acoustic engineering provides technical foundation for performance claims. The positioning targeting both audiophiles and music fans represents legitimate market segmentation, though the premium pricing relative to available performance data lacks full technical justification. The carbon paper driver technology demonstrates some commitment to technical advancement, though the absence of published measurements limits scientific validation of the approach.

## Advice

Double Zero products appeal primarily to Zedd fans and consumers seeking celebrity-endorsed audio accessories rather than measurement-driven performance. The 001 model's aesthetic design, Onkyo engineering, and brand association provide value for users prioritizing visual appeal and artist connection alongside reasonable audio quality expectations.

However, for audio quality and value-focused consumers, superior alternatives exist at lower pricing. The Audio-Technica ATH-M40x delivers comparable functionality with established professional credibility at 50% of the cost, while manufacturers provide credible measurement data and proven support infrastructure. Current limited availability through third-party retailers further complicates acquisition for new buyers.

The Double Zero brand represents the audio industry's celebrity marketing approach with legitimate technical backing, though the discontinued production status and pricing relative to alternatives make it primarily suitable for collectors and dedicated fans rather than users prioritizing objective performance criteria.
