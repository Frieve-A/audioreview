## Overview

Juice Hifi is a specialized digital acoustic correction software company founded in Norway in 2007 by Bernt Rønningsbakk. An engineer with a Master's degree in Industrial Economics and Technology Management and a Ph.D. in Technological Innovation Management, he dedicated himself to acoustic software development after 15 years as a business consultant. The flagship 'Audiolense' series precisely optimizes speaker and room acoustic characteristics using FIR filter-based frequency correction and True Time Domain (TTD) correction technology. Despite its small size, the company has earned a strong reputation among computer audio enthusiasts for its high level of technical expertise.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The frequency and time-domain correction provided by Audiolense using FIR filters is a scientifically-backed technology based on objective measurement data. Specifically, True Time Domain (TTD) correction achieves phase linearization, something impossible with traditional IIR filters, by perfectly synchronizing the first arrival sound across all frequencies. The digital crossover function enables high-precision adjustments through a two-step process: correcting each driver individually for time and frequency, then re-correcting them as an integrated unit. However, the effectiveness of TTD correction can be limited by the quality of the measurement microphone, as USB microphones may introduce time errors.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Juice Hifi possesses top-tier technology in FIR filter design and digital signal processing. Its high-precision level matching and time synchronization for all speaker drivers in a multi-channel environment are as advanced as competitors like Acourate and Dirac Live. Thanks to the founder's extensive academic and technical background, the correlation between measured values and simulation results is extremely high. The software implements advanced algorithms that correctly identify and preserve reflections that should not be removed. However, there is room for improvement in system integration, as it is limited to Windows and requires combining multiple software programs from measurement to playback.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Audiolense XO (€390) offers a comprehensive feature set, including a digital crossover and True Time Domain (TTD) correction. When compared to competing software with a similar advanced feature set, such as AudioVero Acourate (€416), Audiolense XO is more affordable. While it is theoretically possible to achieve similar functionality by combining free tools like REW and RePhase, this requires advanced expertise and a significant time investment. Considering the integrated workflow and functionality that Audiolense provides, its price represents excellent cost-performance. Based on the review policy, it can be rated as the lowest-priced product among those with equivalent features, thus CP = 390 ÷ 390 = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Having been continuously developed and sold for 17 years since 2007, the product's long-term stability is proven. Technical issues are resolved promptly through active information exchange on user forums and direct support from the founder. However, as a small company, services like 24/7 support and multilingual assistance are limited. Firmware updates are released regularly, but you cannot expect comprehensive support systems or replacement units for hardware failure, as you would from a large corporation. The annual support and upgrade plan requires a paid subscription, which is a consideration for long-term cost.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The fundamental approach of acoustic correction through digital signal processing is extremely rational, pursuing the ideal in acoustic engineering: objective optimization based on measurement data. The strategy of achieving high functionality through software eliminates the need for expensive dedicated hardware, allowing for top-tier correction at a lower cost. In this respect, the company's design philosophy is highly commendable. However, there are aspects that could be improved from a modern perspective. The software being Windows-only is a significant limitation when cross-platform is becoming the standard. Furthermore, the workflow, which relies on integration with multiple external software programs for measurement and filter application, demands a high level of user literacy and presents usability challenges. These points act as barriers to bringing its excellent core technology to a wider audience.

## Advice

Juice Hifi's Audiolense is an excellent choice for advanced users seeking sophisticated FIR filter technology and time-domain correction. It offers a more user-friendly workflow than competing products, especially for integrating digital crossovers and room correction in a multi-channel setup. However, it is advisable to thoroughly compare its features and price with Dirac Live Full before purchasing. Also, consider that a high-quality measurement microphone is essential, which will be an additional initial investment. As it only runs on Windows, macOS and Linux users will need to prepare a virtualized environment. It is recommended only for those who are willing to undertake DIY speaker projects or serious audio system building, after calculating the long-term costs, including annual support fees.
