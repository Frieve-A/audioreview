## Overview

Tangzu is an audio manufacturer established in China in 2020. With a mission to promote "freedom" and new concepts of high-fidelity audio, the company specializes in in-ear monitors. Products are named after traditional Chinese cultural figures, reflecting this aesthetic in their branding. They offer a wide lineup ranging from the entry-level Wan'er S.G to the flagship Tian Peng, with prices from 19 USD to 629 USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Tangzu's products meet objective standards in basic measurement performance. The entry-level Wan'er S.G (19 USD) features standard specifications, including an impedance of 20Ω, sensitivity of 107dB, a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz, and THD below 0.5%. The flagship Tian Peng (629 USD) has a multi-driver configuration with a 9.8Ω impedance and 104dB sensitivity, adhering to modern technical standards for in-ear monitors. The acoustic design is based on established principles of audio engineering, with no pseudo-scientific claims or occult elements observed.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Tangzu's technology level is at the industry average. While they properly implement established technologies such as multi-driver configurations, PET diaphragms, and detachable cables, they lack proprietary innovations or breakthrough technologies. Their approach is primarily focused on combining existing technologies from other manufacturers rather than developing unique solutions. The technical specifications meet modern standards but do not demonstrate leadership in any particular area of audio engineering.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The cost-performance receives a harsh evaluation. The entry-model Wan'er S.G (19 USD) is priced similarly to competitors like the 7Hz Salnotes Zero (22 USD) and Moondrop Chu II (19 USD), but fails to demonstrate a clear performance advantage. The calculation is: 19 USD ÷ 19 USD = 1.0.
The main issue lies with their high-priced products. The flagship Tian Peng (629 USD) has no price advantage even when compared to the similarly priced ThieAudio Oracle MKII (589 USD) (589 USD ÷ 629 USD = 0.94). More critically, it pales in comparison to more affordable products. For instance, a product like the AFUL Performer 5 (219 USD) costs less than half the price of the Tian Peng, yet earns equivalent or superior performance ratings from many reviewers. The existence of such products that transcend their price class significantly diminishes the value proposition of Tangzu's high-end models.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a manufacturer established in 2020, Tangzu has a limited track record of long-term reliability. There is little specific information available about their product warranty or after-sales support system, and a global support network is not well-established. The primary sales channels are through overseas resellers, making direct customer support from the manufacturer difficult to obtain. While no major quality issues have been reported, the company's short history warrants caution, especially when purchasing high-priced products.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Tangzu's design philosophy follows established audio engineering principles without introducing unscientific elements. Their use of traditional Chinese cultural themes in product naming and branding is a reasonable marketing approach. However, their heavy reliance on combining existing technologies rather than developing unique solutions limits the rationality of their design approach. While not irrational, their philosophy lacks the innovative direction that would justify their pricing strategy, especially for high-end models.

## Advice

While Tangzu possesses basic technical capabilities, a careful evaluation is required before making a purchase. The entry-level Wan'er S.G (19 USD) is a viable option as a beginner's IEM in its price range, but we strongly recommend comparing it with strong competitors like the Moondrop Chu II and 7Hz Salnotes Zero.
For flagship models, you should consider more established alternatives like the ThieAudio Oracle MKII or options with overwhelming cost-performance such as the AFUL Performer 5. As a startup manufacturer, there are concerns about long-term support, making it essential to thoroughly confirm the warranty conditions of the retailer, especially for expensive products. Although there are no major technical flaws, we recommend fully exploring other options from a cost-performance and reliability perspective.
