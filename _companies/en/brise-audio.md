## Overview

Brise Audio is an audio cable specialist manufacturer based in Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Founded by representative Keiichi Watanabe and director Naoki Okada, with Watanabe having approximately 20 years of experience in PC and audio cable fields. The company adheres to handmade craftsmanship, manufacturing everything from IEM recabling to high-end speaker cables and digital cables. They advocate a unique design philosophy emphasizing shielding from electromagnetic interference, providing all products through made-to-order production. They develop product lines including YATONO, ASUHA, and NAOBI series, with shipments to countries worldwide.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Scientific verification of audio cable sound quality improvement effects via ABX tests and double-blind methods repeatedly finds no statistically significant differences between properly designed cables. In addition, measurement indicators such as frequency response, THD, S/N ratio, and crosstalk do not show objective differences that would support audible changes when cables operate within specification. For Brise Audio products as well, no primary-source evidence demonstrates sound quality improvements in the audible range under general usage conditions.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Brise Audio demonstrates high technical levels through handmade manufacturing. They differentiate between using OFC copper materials for audio signals and high-quality silver wire materials for digital signals, adopting unique multi-layer shielding structures. Particularly in the YATONO Ultimate series, they employ 8-core structures and use Pentaconn connectors, showing ingenuity in physical structural design. Quality control through manual processes in manufacturing, individual response capability through made-to-order production, and technical accumulation based on 20 years of manufacturing experience represent above-average industry standards for cable manufacturing technology. However, whether these technologies contribute to performance improvement in audible ranges is a separate matter.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Brise Audio's ASUHA Ref.2 is priced at 1,000 USD, while TRN 8-core cable providing equivalent functionality is available for 13 USD. The calculation formula is 13 USD รท 1,000 USD = 0.013, resulting in extremely low cost-performance evaluation. Basic functions required for IEM cables - signal transmission, durability, and detachable mechanisms - are sufficiently realized even in budget products, and no functional advantages exist to justify approximately 77 times the price difference. Similarly, other product lines like YATONO Ultimate series have alternatives from KBear and Yinyoo around 12-15 USD, with no practical differences from user perspectives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Brise Audio has an established corporate structure despite being small-scale, with the representative having 20 years of industry experience, which is commendable. They maintain thorough quality control through made-to-order production systems and have shipping records to countries worldwide. Individual quality control through handmade manufacturing and custom order response capabilities represent reliability slightly above industry average as a small-scale specialist manufacturer. However, due to small company size, there are concerns about long-term support structures and continuity of parts supply compared to major manufacturers. Limited detailed information about warranty periods and repair services is also an issue.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The design philosophy of shielding from electromagnetic interference has some technical basis, but scientific consensus regarding effects in audible ranges has not been achieved. While using high-quality materials and optimizing physical structures is engineering-wise rational, the ultimate goal of "sound quality improvement" lacks objective evidence, limiting the overall rationality of the design philosophy. Particularly, with alternative means existing that can achieve equivalent functionality at significantly lower costs, the necessity of existing as expensive specialized audio cables is low, making it irrational from cost-efficiency perspectives. In modern times with advanced measurement technologies, product development dependent on subjective evaluation has outdated aspects.

## Advice

While Brise Audio products certainly possess high manufacturing technology and material quality, objective performance improvements commensurate with their prices cannot be expected. Considering that equivalent functionality can be obtained with TRN 8-core cable (13 USD) compared to the 1,000 USD ASUHA Ref.2, cost-performance is remarkably poor. Scientific verification of audio cable effects on sound quality consistently shows negative results, so purchases should be carefully considered. When considering cable replacement, we recommend first experiencing durability and usability improvements with budget products around 12-15 USD, and only considering expensive products if unsatisfied with those results. For sound quality improvement, prioritizing investment in equipment with measurable performance differences like headphones themselves or DACs rather than cables is rational.
