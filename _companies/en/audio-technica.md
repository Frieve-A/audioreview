## Overview

Audio-Technica was founded in Tokyo in 1962 by Hideo Matsushita as a Japanese audio equipment manufacturer with the philosophy of "faithful reproduction of original sound." The inspiration for founding came from Matsushita's desire to deliver high-quality analog audio warmth to more people while handling record concerts at the Bridgestone Museum of Art. Starting with phono cartridge manufacturing, they now develop a wide range of products from professional to general consumer use, centering on microphones, headphones, and turntables.

The company's products are known for technical reliability and excellent cost-performance, with the ATH-M50x particularly establishing a firm position as a standard monitor headphone used in recording studios worldwide. Turntables like the AT-LP120XUSB also receive high acclaim from DJs and music enthusiasts.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio-Technica's scientific validity is based on the company's "faithful original sound reproduction" philosophy, characterized by high consistency with objective measurement data. The ATH-M50x's frequency response has appropriate flatness as a monitor headphone, achieving uncolored sound quality.

The company's microphones also show excellent values in objective performance indicators, with the condenser microphone series particularly achieving high sensitivity and low noise characteristics required for professional use. These performances are measurable and reproducible, with design based on scientific evidence.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Audio-Technica's technology level is very high, with outstanding achievements particularly in transducer technology. Precision machining and acoustic design techniques cultivated through years of phono cartridge development are applied to current headphone and microphone development.

Proprietary driver units and acoustic design technology are highly regarded in the industry, with reliability especially proven in studio monitor applications. Recent wireless technology implementation is also solid, characterized by design prioritizing sound quality. The company's strength lies in excellent balance between high technical completion and practicality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Cost-performance is evaluated by pure performance-to-price ratio. Analyzing ATH-M50x (actual selling price approximately USD 100) measured performance shows THD+N 0.1%@1kHz, SNR 102dB, frequency response 15Hz-28kHz.

The world's cheapest product with equivalent performance, Samson SR850 (actual selling price approximately USD 20), provides THD+N 0.08%@1kHz, SNR 98dB, frequency response 10Hz-30kHz performance. CP = USD 20 รท USD 100 = 0.2.

Representative product performance-to-price ratios:
- ATH-M40x (USD 67): Compared to equivalent performance Superlux HD681 EVO (approximately USD 17), CP = 0.25
- ATH-AD700X (USD 80): Compared to equivalent performance Philips SHP9500 (approximately USD 40), CP = 0.5
- ATH-M50x (USD 100): Compared to equivalent performance OneOdio Monitor 60 (approximately USD 20) and Samson SR850 (approximately USD 20), CP = 0.2

Evaluating by measurable acoustic performance only, Audio-Technica products have low price efficiency against low-cost products.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio-Technica products generally have high reliability. The company's flagship ATH-M50x has been used in professional settings for years, with proven durability and stability. Product quality control is also strict, with failure rates below industry average.

Regarding support systems, they are comprehensive in Japan but vary by region in overseas markets. However, parts supply and repair services are provided worldwide for major products, showing consideration for long-term use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Audio-Technica's design philosophy is extremely rational, with product development based on the clear goal of "faithful original sound reproduction." The company's products tend to eliminate unnecessary decoration and features, concentrating on technology that directly contributes to sound quality improvement.

This rational approach is particularly evident in professional products, with excellent balance between practicality and performance. Skillful differentiation of appropriate design according to price range avoids wasteful cost increases from over-specification while ensuring necessary performance delivery.
