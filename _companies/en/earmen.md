## Overview

EarMen is a portable audio equipment manufacturer founded by Milomir "Miki" Trosic, who has over a decade of experience developing tube amplifiers. As a sister company to Auris Audio, EarMen focuses on creating portable DACs and headphone amplifiers with their motto "Sound above all." The company is headquartered in Chicago, IL, with products manufactured in Europe to ensure high manufacturing standards. EarMen's product lineup includes balanced and unbalanced configurations, battery-powered and device-powered options, supporting DSD, DXD, PCM, and MQA formats. The company emerged from Auris Audio's desire to make high-fidelity audio more accessible to a larger audience through compact, portable solutions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

EarMen products demonstrate significant discrepancies between claimed specifications and measured performance. The Tradutto shows poor linearity, filter response, and dynamic range performance according to ASR measurements [1]. RCA output voltage measured at 2.2V versus the claimed 4V, with SINAD rated as "average" and dynamic range described as "non-competitive." The Sparrow exhibits sampling limitations, being exposed as 48 kHz/16 bits during testing despite high-resolution claims, and shows high distortion despite claimed THD+N of -112 dB [2]. The Eagle lacks independent third-party measurements for verification. Conservative evaluation applied due to limited verified measurement data for most products, with multiple indicators falling between problematic and transparent performance levels based on established audio engineering benchmarks.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

EarMen demonstrates moderate technology level with in-house design capabilities and accumulated expertise from over a decade of tube amplifier development [3]. The company employs contemporary ESS DAC technology including ES9281PRO chips and SABRE DACs with appropriate digital/circuit integration. Products feature high-grade power supply components, super low ESR tantalum capacitors, and 4-layer gold-plated PCBs [4]. However, the technology approach relies heavily on standard ESS DAC implementations without significant proprietary innovations or patent technology adoption. The competitive advantage is limited as other manufacturers can easily achieve similar results using the same readily available DAC chips and standard implementation approaches.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Cost-performance analysis reveals mixed results across EarMen's product portfolio using weighted average methodology for multiple product evaluation. The Sparrow at 199 USD faces competition from the FiiO KA17 at 149 USD, which provides equivalent-or-better functions with superior measured performance (THD+N -120 dB measured vs high distortion measured, 650mW vs 125mW output power at 32Ω balanced) and broader format support [5]. CP = 149 ÷ 199 = 0.7. The Eagle at approximately 129 USD competes against the Truthear SHIO at 69.99 USD, which offers equivalent-or-better functionality with superior measured performance (150mW vs 62mW output power, near top SINAD charts vs no measurement data) [6]. CP = 69.99 ÷ 129 = 0.5. Company average calculated as simple average of representative products (0.7 + 0.5) ÷ 2 = 0.6, showing moderate value proposition with several competitive alternatives offering better performance at similar or lower prices.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

EarMen offers a standard two-year limited warranty with in-house production in Serbia/Europe by experienced engineers, providing reasonable construction quality [7]. However, battery warranty is limited to only 6 months, which is short for battery-powered portable devices. The warranty is non-transferable, applies only to original owners, and requires product registration within 30 days of purchase [8]. Customer service provides 45-day repair resolution with manufacturer support, though costs are charged to owners post-warranty. The company maintains established heritage through Auris Audio (founded 2013) but support infrastructure appears primarily dealer-based rather than comprehensive global manufacturer support systems.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

EarMen's design philosophy explicitly rejects measurement-based evaluation, stating "We realized a long time ago that it's not all about measurements and results from paper, so we don't even compete with others, because perfect sound has no competition" [9]. The company emphasizes subjective personal experience over scientific verification, claiming "perfect sound has no competition—it's a personal experience of something pure." This approach contradicts rational audio engineering principles that prioritize measureable performance improvements. The heritage connection to vacuum tube amplification through sister company Auris Audio further reinforces a philosophy based on subjective rather than scientific criteria. The emphasis on "natural materials" and "skillful hands" over technological advancement demonstrates an irrational approach to audio equipment development.

## Advice

EarMen products may appeal to users seeking portable audio solutions with European manufacturing heritage, but potential buyers should consider superior alternatives available at competitive prices. The Truthear SHIO offers significantly better value and measured performance than the Eagle, while the FiiO KA17 provides superior specifications compared to the Sparrow. Users prioritizing verified measurement data should look elsewhere, as EarMen's philosophy explicitly rejects measurement-based validation. The company's two-year warranty provides reasonable coverage, but the short 6-month battery warranty and restrictive warranty terms may concern long-term users. Consider EarMen only if the specific design aesthetic and subjective philosophy align with personal preferences, understanding that objectively superior alternatives exist at similar or lower prices.
