summary: "German precision engineering manufacturer specializing in analog turntables and related measurement instruments. Their technology serves merely to marginally improve the fundamental performance limitations of analog, an inherently inferior reproduction method. When measured against the absolute standard of master source fidelity, their products fall short of even affordable digital equipment across all performance metrics, making their value proposition extremely limited and cost-performance essentially non-existent."

## Overview

Dr. Feickert Analogue was founded in 2005 by physicist Dr. Christian Feickert, establishing itself as a German analog audio specialist manufacturer. The company is globally recognized for its high-performance turntable designs, with products based on precision engineering and distinctive technical approaches. Beyond developing their own products, they also manufacture measurement instruments such as the "Protractor NG" for precise turntable setup, demonstrating their deep expertise in analog reproduction technology as a whole.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Analog record reproduction is scientifically inferior when viewed from the perspective of fidelity to master sources. In all objective performance metrics - S/N ratio, dynamic range, frequency response flatness, timing accuracy (wow and flutter), and channel separation - it falls far short of even standard digital reproduction (16bit/44.1kHz). Dr. Feickert's technology merely provides marginal improvements to the fundamental flaws of this low-performance method (rotational irregularities and mechanical noise) through heavy platters and multiple motor drives. However, these improvements are completely meaningless compared to the near-perfect timing accuracy and noise floor achieved by digital reproduction. Any claimed "sound quality" improvements are simply the result of added distortion and noise, contributing nothing to scientific fidelity enhancement.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The company's technology represents a "Galapagos-style" evolution - an attempt to extend the life of an obsolete format. While inverted bearing designs, multiple motor drives, and sliding arm bases represent sophisticated mechanical engineering achievements, their goal (improved rotational accuracy) cannot compete with modern crystal oscillator and servo circuit-based direct drive systems, or digital reproduction systems with no mechanical moving parts, on either cost or performance grounds. For example, while a DAC like the "Topping E70 Velvet" costing tens of thousands of yen achieves SINAD of 125dB or higher, record reproduction is limited to approximately 70dB even under optimal conditions. The company's technology represents an extremely inefficient method of marginally pushing the boundaries of an inherently low-performance technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Cost-performance is catastrophically poor, approaching zero based on our definition. The company's flagship "Woodpecker" (approximately USD 8,000 excluding arm) delivers source fidelity that is decisively outperformed across all measurement categories by digital systems costing less than USD 667 combined - for example, a DAC like "S.M.S.L SU-1" (approximately USD 100) and power amplifier "Fosi Audio V3" (approximately USD 133) paired with a PC. Even comparing within analog playback systems, the Technics "SL-1200GR" (street price around USD 1,333) achieves excellent wow and flutter performance of 0.025% W.R.M.S., leaving no performance-based justification for Dr. Feickert products costing many times more. The calculation is straightforward: `CP = Price of cheapest product with equivalent performance รท Target product price`. Since the numerator is dramatically smaller than the denominator, the score receives the minimum rating.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The physical manufacturing quality of their products is high, with robust construction befitting German precision machinery. They use high-quality metals and wood materials, and the durability of mechanical components is expected to be excellent. Support is also provided through distributors, with basic high-end product infrastructure in place. However, the structure consists of complex mechanical assemblies requiring regular maintenance and adjustment. Long-term performance degradation due to wear and aging is inevitable, with expensive repair and overhaul costs anticipated. This represents a clear disadvantage compared to maintenance-free digital equipment with virtually no performance degradation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

From the perspective of audio's true purpose - "achieving the highest level of fidelity to master sources" - the company's design philosophy is completely irrational. Fixating on analog records, a medium with poor performance and many physical constraints, and investing enormous costs and complex mechanisms to compensate for minor deficiencies represents a reversal of means and ends. Devoting engineering resources to extending obsolete technology rather than pursuing more efficient, high-performance digital technology raises serious questions about rationality. While individual designs follow physical principles, the overall project direction significantly deviates from the goal of faithful reproduction.

## Advice

Dr. Feickert Analogue products are not audio equipment. They are "extremely expensive crafts and toys for enjoying the act of operating sophisticated machinery to reproduce analog records, a medium of the past." For the purpose of accurately reproducing information contained in master sources, they are completely outperformed by digital equipment costing a fraction of the price.

If you want to listen to music with the highest possible fidelity to the creator's intent, you should not invest any funds in the company's products. Instead, invest that budget in excellent DACs, amplifiers, and speakers or headphones. If you value the ritual of placing a needle on a record or watching a spinning platter more than the music itself, that is a different hobby from audio, and if you're considering purchase as tools for that hobby, your personal satisfaction becomes the sole criterion for judgment.
