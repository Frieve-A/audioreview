## Overview

iitrust CO.,LTD Audio Equipment Division (Earaku) is a Chinese-based audio equipment manufacturer established in 2013. The company has established JUST MATCH Co., Ltd. as a group company in Japan, primarily engaged in the development and sales of neck speakers, open-type earphones, and desktop speakers. They offer the You-on neck speaker series and Bluetooth headsets, with a product lineup specialized for calls and telework applications rather than music listening. The company emphasizes consumer feedback-driven product development and focuses primarily on sales through crowdfunding platforms and Amazon.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The measurement data for the company's products is limited, with published specifications covering only basic parameters. The J132 neck speaker's maximum output of 9W and speaker configuration of 4Ω/3W + 8Ω/1.5W represents typical output levels, but detailed acoustic measurement data such as frequency response, THD, and S/N ratio are not publicly available. While basic functions like IPX5 water resistance and Bluetooth 5.3 support are provided, the transparency of technical specifications directly related to audio quality is low, with insufficient evidence to reach the transparent level of the measurement criteria table. The sound leakage characteristics inherent to neck speakers (audible within approximately 5m) also demonstrate limitations in acoustic design, making them unsuitable for high-fidelity reproduction.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Technically, the products primarily combine existing technologies, with no distinctive design or advanced approaches evident. The J132's six acoustic modes (RPG, FPS, Voice, Movie, Music, Stereo) and low-latency transmission via Rena Pro transmitter (2.4GHz) are practical but remain at industry-standard implementation levels. The 3D surround implementation with four speakers is also basic pseudo-surround through conventional placement, with no innovative technologies confirmed that contribute to improved measurement performance. The so-called Renova Sound technology lacks specific technical specifications and appears to be marketing terminology. Compared to industry-leading standards, the technical level is clearly inferior.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

For the company's J011 neck speaker (approximately 8,000 JPY), an alternative product with equivalent or superior Bluetooth connectivity, 13-hour playback, and IPX5 water resistance exists in the JBL SoundGear Sense (approximately 6,000 JPY). Calculation: 6,000 JPY ÷ 8,000 JPY = 0.75, rounded to 0.8. However, within the specialized category of neck speakers where options are limited, the pricing is relatively reasonable for call-focused applications. The J132 (approximately 15,000 JPY) is also not significantly overpriced compared to competing products like the SteelSeries Arctis 7P (approximately 12,000 JPY) for gaming-oriented neck speakers.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

As a relatively new company established in 2013, long-term reliability data is insufficient. While a sales structure has been established in the Japanese market through JUST MATCH Co., Ltd., there is no publicly available data on failure rates or MTBF. The product warranty period is at industry-standard levels, but the quality of technical support and repair systems remains unclear, making the reliability of this emerging manufacturer uncertain. The frequent use of crowdfunding for sales also presents concerns regarding continuous after-sales support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The product strategy specializing in call and telework applications represents a rational approach to market needs. The open-type design for environmental sound awareness and lightweight construction (J011: 88g) are appropriate design decisions for the intended use. However, efforts toward audio quality improvement for music reproduction are limited, with no visible technical development direction aimed at Hi-Fi reproduction. The six acoustic modes and gaming-specific features are understandable as differentiation elements, but no scientific approach contributing to fundamental acoustic performance improvement can be confirmed. While there is justification for existence as dedicated equipment, the basis for clear advantages over general-purpose Bluetooth headsets is weak.

## Advice

We recommend considering iitrust products exclusively for call, telework, and background listening applications. For music listening purposes, general Bluetooth headphones or earphones in the same price range offer superior audio quality. These products are suitable for users who prioritize the openness and lightweight comfort unique to neck speakers, emphasizing convenience over audio quality, but other manufacturers' products should be chosen for high-quality audio applications. Before purchasing, it is essential to audition the products and confirm the degree of sound leakage and wearing comfort. Given the company's status as an emerging manufacturer, we recommend confirming long-term support and parts supply with retailers. There is room for improvement in the company's technical accumulation and transparency in measurement data disclosure, requiring attention to future technical developments.
