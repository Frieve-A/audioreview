## Overview

Canare Electric Co., Ltd., founded in 1970 by Kimio Kawamoto in Nagoya, Japan, specializes in professional audio/video cables, connectors, and fiber-optic products. After introducing low-noise star-quad microphone cable in the late 1970s, Canare became a staple for broadcast engineers and live-sound technicians. The L-4E6S star-quad mic cable is widely used in studios and venues worldwide.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

For balanced microphone and line-level use, properly made cables should be audibly transparent at typical lengths. Canare’s L-4E6S specifies core-to-core capacitance of **150 pF/m** and a braided copper shield with **~94% coverage**; DC resistance is **9.8 Ω/100 m** (conductor) and **≈3.1 Ω/100 m** (shield) [1][2]. On a 20 ft (≈6.1 m) run, total C ≈ **0.91 nF**; with a 150 Ω microphone source the RC cutoff is around **1.1 MHz**, far above the audio band—consistent with transparency. Canare’s technical page documents the **star-quad** geometry’s magnetic-noise suppression (e.g., **SCR dimmer noise reduced to <1/10** vs. 2-conductor mic cable) [2]. Independent demonstrations of star-quad cabling show **~20–30 dB** reductions of magnetically induced hum (and up to **~20–50 dB** in a demo) compared to standard twisted pair, under otherwise identical exposure [7][8]. Separately, third-party measurements on Canare’s **4S11 speaker cable** found essentially flat frequency response and negligible timing artefacts—evidence consistent with well-designed copper conductors behaving linearly in the audible band [4]. Overall, published specs and demonstrations support audibly transparent operation and superior EMI rejection in hostile environments.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

L-4E6S employs **four 24 AWG conductors** (each **40/0.08 mm** strands) arranged in an X (“star-quad”) to minimize loop area and cancel external magnetic fields; insulation is **irradiated (cross-linked) polyethylene** for durability and stable electrical characteristics; shielding is a high-coverage braided copper shield (**~94%**) [1][2]. The design is robust and field-proven rather than cutting-edge—it prioritizes noise rejection, flexibility, and longevity over novel materials.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Target price (review basis):** Canare L-4E6S, 20 ft XLRM–XLRF premade cable — **46.50 USD** [5].  
**Cheapest equivalent-or-better:** **Kopul Premier Quad Pro 5000**, 20 ft XLRM–XLRF — **26.99 USD**; star-quad geometry, OFC conductors, and high-density braid with Neutrik connectors (functionally equivalent for users) [6].

**Calculation:** 26.99 ÷ 46.50 = **0.58** → **0.6** (rounded to one decimal, per site rules).  
Result: Canare delivers excellent performance but is priced notably above the least-expensive star-quad alternatives that achieve the same user-visible results.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Canare cables are known for consistent build quality, flexible jackets that remain supple in cold conditions, and long service life in pro environments. The company operates regional entities (e.g., Canare Corporation of America, Canare Europe) and a global distributor network, supporting large installations and replacement logistics. While warranty terms vary by region, overall field reliability is strong.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Focusing on **measurable** improvements (magnetic-noise rejection via star-quad geometry, stable dielectric, and dense braid) is rational and aligned with transparent audio goals. The approach is evolutionary rather than radical, but the engineering choices target real-world, testable benefits (especially in high-EMI venues).

## Advice

Choose Canare when you want proven construction, broad color/length options, and long-term durability across a facility. For **quiet** environments and short runs, any quality balanced mic cable will be transparent; for **high-EMI** stages or long runs, **star-quad** (including Canare or lower-priced equivalents) yields measurable hum reduction. If budget is tight, the Kopul Premier Quad Pro 5000 (20 ft) offers equivalent user-facing performance at a lower price; if uniform brand/spec across an installation matters, Canare remains a safe standard.
