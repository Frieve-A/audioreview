summary: "Chinese audio manufacturer established in 1993. Leveraging experience in vacuum tube amplifier development, they have established a presence in the portable audio market. While ambitious products like their proprietary discrete DAC are noteworthy, many products including vacuum tube models do not prioritize fidelity to master sources, creating a divisive design philosophy. In terms of pure performance-to-price ratio, they face challenging competition against modern high-performance devices."

## Overview

Cayin is a Hi-Fi brand from Chinese audio company Zhuhai Spark Electronic Equipment Co., Ltd., established in 1993. Originally known for high-quality vacuum tube amplifiers that earned high praise from audio enthusiasts, they entered the portable audio market in earnest in 2013. They have since released a succession of digital audio players (DAPs), portable amplifiers, and dongle DACs. Their distinctive features include ambitious and creative product development, such as dual-timbre functionality that allows users to enjoy both vacuum tube and solid-state sound signatures in one device, and proprietary discrete DAC implementation not found in other manufacturers' products.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Cayin's products possess basic electrical circuit design and audio performance necessary for functioning as DAPs and amplifiers, with no unscientific claims. The tonal variations from vacuum tubes are based on measurable harmonic distortion changes, providing users with selectable acoustic characteristics according to their preferences. Key specifications such as output and noise levels are publicly available, establishing a solid scientific foundation as audio equipment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The capability to develop and commercialize proprietary 1-bit discrete DACs without relying on off-the-shelf DAC chips deserves high industry recognition. However, the technology of incorporating vacuum tubes into portable devices, while technically challenging to implement, cannot be evaluated positively from the review policy's perspective of "contribution to high-fidelity reproduction." Vacuum tubes are inherently inferior to solid-state devices in measured performance, intentionally adding harmonic distortion and compromising fidelity to master sources. Therefore, while discrete DAC development is commendable, the inclusion of vacuum tubes prevents classifying their technology level as top-tier.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

When evaluated purely on fidelity performance (THD+N, S/N ratio, etc.) versus price, the cost-performance must be considered extremely low. For example, Cayin's flagship DAP N7 (approximately USD 1,867 retail) advertises an excellent THD+N of 0.0001%, but products like Topping's DX3 Pro+ achieve equivalent or superior measured performance at approximately USD 200 - less than 1/9 the price. While Cayin's value lies in unique sound tuning and functionality, the pure performance-to-price ratio results in harsh evaluation.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Cayin has established a global dealer network, with purchases and support available through official distributors in Japan. Firmware updates are continuously provided, and improvements based on user feedback are implemented. Quality control and long-term support systems meet industry standard levels, making it a brand that can be used with confidence.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Cayin's design philosophy shows technical exploration through discrete DAC development, but deviates from the review policy's absolute standard of "fidelity to master sources." The vacuum tube sound modification feature intentionally adds distortion to alter sound, representing an approach diametrically opposed to high-fidelity reproduction. While providing users with sound tuning options represents one product concept, from a scientific rationality standpoint, it deviates from the goal of reproducing master sources as faithfully as possible, making high evaluation difficult.

## Advice

Cayin is not suitable for users who want the latest measured performance at the most affordable price. Rather, it is a brand for experienced audio enthusiasts seeking the warmth of vacuum tube sound or the unique sonic texture provided by discrete DACs. Particularly for users who want to maximize the potential of their headphones or earphones and pursue their preferred sound signature, Cayin's diverse functionality offers significant appeal. While expensive, it provides a rare existence that delivers unique musical experiences unavailable elsewhere.
