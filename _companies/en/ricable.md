## Overview

Ricable Ltd. is an Italian Hi-Fi cable manufacturer founded in 2009 by Sergio Modenesi in Oleggio, Italy [1]. The company produces various audio cables across four main series: Invictus (high-end, 408-1,616 USD), Dedalus (mid-premium), Magnus (mid-range), and Primus (entry-level, 72-275 USD). Ricable positions itself as a premium manufacturer offering lifetime warranty on all products and claims significant performance improvements over standard cables. The company emphasizes "Made in Italy" quality and direct customer support, transitioning from a garage startup to an established manufacturer with international distribution [5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Ricable makes specific performance improvement claims without scientific validation. The company advertises "+400% Performance compared to a standard cable" for Invictus series [2] and "+70% Performance compared to a standard cable" for Primus series [3], but provides no measurement data or ABX blind testing evidence to support these manufacturer claims. No electrical specifications such as resistance, capacitance, or impedance values are disclosed for most products, except basic impedance specification for AES/EBU cables (110Ω, manufacturer specification). The framework explicitly states that high-priced products claiming audible sound quality improvements without ABX testing or equivalent audibility evidence receive zero scientific validity score. Without credible third-party measurements or controlled testing demonstrating audible differences, these performance claims lack scientific foundation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Ricable demonstrates moderate technical sophistication through proprietary technologies including MARC© copper conductor technology, R-TEC© dielectric/insulation technologies, and RCC© copper OFC connectors. The company employs in-house design and manufacturing in Italy with custom cable geometries and conductor arrangements. Advanced features include 7N pure copper conductors, multiple shielding layers (up to five shields on USB cables), and 24K gold-plated connectors. However, the technology approach remains limited to traditional analog cable construction methods without integration of digital, software, or AI technologies. While the proprietary material technologies show technical advancement, the overall approach lacks cutting-edge innovation compared to modern audio engineering solutions.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Ricable's cost-performance ratio is extremely poor across all product lines. Analysis of representative products reveals significant price premiums compared to functionally equivalent alternatives. The Primus Signal RCA cable at 107 USD provides equivalent functionality to Amazon Basics RCA cables at 16 USD [4]. Equipped with copper conductors and gold-plated connectors, the Amazon Basics product delivers equivalent-or-better signal transmission capabilities, yielding CP = 16 USD ÷ 107 USD = 0.15. The Primus Speaker cable at 275 USD compares to KabelDirekt 16 AWG OFC speaker cables at 25 USD. Equipped with oxygen-free copper conductors and equivalent gauge specifications, and signal transmission performance is equivalent-or-better, yielding CP = 25 USD ÷ 275 USD = 0.09. High-end Invictus Signal cables at 727 USD face the same 16 USD Amazon Basics equivalent [4], resulting in CP = 16 USD ÷ 727 USD = 0.02. These calculations demonstrate that equivalent-or-better functionality and measured performance are available at 2-15% of Ricable's pricing, representing poor value for consumers seeking objective audio performance improvements.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Ricable excels in reliability and customer support, offering lifetime warranty on all products - significantly exceeding industry standard 2-year warranties. The company provides comprehensive support infrastructure including global customer service, direct manufacturer communication (no automated systems), and free pickup/return service for warranty claims. Cable construction features simple, robust design with quality copper conductors and gold-plated connectors, inherently resistant to failure due to few moving parts. Additional customer benefits include 60-day money-back guarantee with free returns (on direct purchases) and established track record since 2009 with consistent growth and customer-focused approach. The Italian manufacturing quality assurance and direct founder involvement contribute to strong reliability credentials.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Ricable's design philosophy demonstrates poor scientific rationality despite claiming focus on "neutrality" and "transparency." The company makes unmeasurable performance claims ("+400%", "+70%") without providing measurement data to support these assertions. No measurement-focused approach is demonstrated, and audible effects are claimed for scientifically questionable elements without controlled testing validation. The majority of product costs appear unrelated to measurable performance improvement, with premium pricing not justified by objective technical advantages over basic cables. The design approach relies exclusively on traditional analog cable construction methods without adopting cutting-edge technologies like DSP, software, or AI integration. This conservative approach conflicts with rational cost-effectiveness principles when equivalent functions and measured performance are achievable through standard cables at significantly lower costs.

## Advice

Ricable products are not recommended for consumers seeking objective audio quality improvements or cost-effective solutions. While the company offers excellent customer support and lifetime warranty, the extreme price premiums (10-50x equivalent alternatives) cannot be justified without scientific evidence of audible improvements. Audio enthusiasts on limited budgets should consider functionally equivalent alternatives like Amazon Basics, KabelDirekt, or Mediabridge cables that provide identical signal transmission capabilities at fraction of the cost. For those valuing premium aesthetics, Italian craftsmanship, or exceptional customer service regardless of cost-performance considerations, Ricable's build quality and warranty support are genuinely superior. However, rational purchasers focused on measured audio performance should allocate budget toward components with scientifically validated improvements rather than premium cables without demonstrated audible benefits.
