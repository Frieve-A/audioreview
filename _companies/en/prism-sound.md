## Overview

Prism Sound was founded in 1987 by Graham Boswell and Ian Dennis after work at Neve on the first DSP-enabled digital console. The firm focuses on two adjacent domains: reference-grade studio AD/DA (Lyra, Titan/Atlas, Dream ADA-128) and professional test & measurement (now trading as Spectral Measurement), a combination that reinforces engineering discipline across both businesses [1][4][8].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Across recent and legacy products, key metrics meet or exceed transparency thresholds. Example figures (manufacturer specs unless noted): ADA-8XR analogue outputs THD+N −101 dB (0.0009% at 997 Hz, −1 dBFS), dynamic range 105 dB, crosstalk >120 dB [1]. Lyra 2 lists THD+N −106 dB (−0.1 dBFS) and dynamic range 115 dB (−60 dBFS) [2]. SOS measured Lyra’s mic-pre EIN at 127.6 dB with a 150 Ω source (good practical noise performance) [3]. The current Dream ADA-128 platform specifies THD+N −111 dB and dynamic range up to 125 dB A-weighted, indicating modern headroom in the line [8]. These results align with audibly transparent performance for conversion and preamplification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Technical depth is high: modular converter architectures (ADA-128), careful clocking and gain accuracy (±0.05 dB typical), and long-standing proprietary features such as the “Overkiller” progressive soft-limit on analogue inputs used to protect against overloads without hard clipping [2][7][8]. The firm’s historic test & measurement arm (now Spectral Measurement) underpins design verification and contributes unique know-how valued by other manufacturers [4].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Representative comparison (company-level): **Prism Lyra 2** (2-in/4-out USB interface) street price **2,649 USD** [6]. **Cheapest equal-or-better alternative** by user-visible functions and core measurements: **MOTU M4** (2-in/4-out) with **120 dB** line-out dynamic range and **−110 dB** THD+N (unweighted) [5]. These output figures are equal-or-better than Lyra 2’s DAC section (115 dB DR, −106 dB THD+N) [2]. **Calculation (required disclosure):** 269.95 USD ÷ 2,649 USD = **0.1019** → **CP = 0.1** (rounded to one decimal) [5][6][2].  

*Note:* This CP uses US market prices (company review per policy); if multiple Prism products are weighted, the trend remains low due to premium pricing relative to transparent-level competitors.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Hardware construction is robust, and the company provides active driver/firmware support pages for Lyra/Titan/Atlas. Warranty is **2 years standard**, extendable to **5 years** upon valid product registration (proof of purchase required) [9][10]. OS support guidance and current control-app/firmware packages are published and maintained [10]. Overall infrastructure is solid for professional use.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The development stance is measurement-first: claims are supported by explicit specifications, with protective input limiting (Overkiller) implemented for engineering reasons rather than coloration. The shift to the high-channel-count, modular Dream ADA-128 evidences rational investment in measurable performance and workflow scalability rather than marketing-driven features [7][8].

## Advice

Choose Prism Sound when you need verification-grade conversion and consistent, publishable specs across a studio or facility—mastering, broadcast, or critical production. If your requirement is simply transparent 2-in/4-out conversion with strong drivers at the lowest cost, mainstream interfaces like MOTU (and peers) deliver equivalent audible transparency for far less money; reserve Prism for cases where build, calibration fidelity, and long-term platform considerations justify the premium [2][5][8].
