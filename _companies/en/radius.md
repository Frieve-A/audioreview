## Overview

Radius Co., Ltd. is a Japanese audio company established as a corporation in 1996, headquartered in Tokyo's Ginza district. The company specializes in wireless earphones and headphones, developing proprietary DDM (Dual Diaphragm Matrix) technology featuring coaxial dual dynamic drivers. The brand focuses on distinctive audio solutions—such as DDM-based models and ear‑hug/open designs—primarily for the Japanese market.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Radius demonstrates moderate technical foundations with verifiable specifications. Their DDM technology uses coaxial dual driver placement, with the HP-R100BT featuring an aluminum housing and high-frequency extension up to 40 kHz (spec: 5–40,000 Hz; Bluetooth 5.0; LDAC/aptX HD/aptX LL/AAC/SBC; 7.0 mm driver; 96±3 dB; 32 Ω) [1]. High-quality codec support including LDAC and aptX HD indicates a commitment to audio fidelity. The HP-V500BT (Bluetooth 5.2) achieves a 20 Hz–20 kHz response with carbon fiber dome diaphragms and supports aptX Adaptive (variable 280–420 kbps; 16-bit/44.1 kHz to 24-bit/48 kHz equivalent) [2][3]. However, the assessment is constrained by the absence of independent third-party measurements (e.g., GRAS/IEC rig frequency response, distortion, etc.), so scientific validation is limited to manufacturer data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The company's proprietary DDM dual diaphragm matrix technology represents meaningful innovation, using coaxial driver placement with separate tweeter and woofer elements. Implementation of aluminum housings (HP‑R100BT) and carbon fiber diaphragms (HP‑V500BT) alongside Bluetooth 5.2/5.0 and comprehensive codec support (LDAC/aptX HD for HP‑R100BT; aptX Adaptive for HP‑V500BT) demonstrates competent engineering. However, the technology level remains moderate compared to industry leaders, with most innovations being incremental improvements rather than breakthrough developments in drivers or DSP.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

For a fair market comparison in Japan, consider HP‑V500BT’s generally available price on Amazon JP at ¥7,700 for new units (color variation) [3] and the cheapest equivalent or better alternative with equal class/functionality and aptX Adaptive, SOUNDPEATS Sonic at ¥5,680 (aptX Adaptive/AAC, QCC3040, IPX5) [4]. Using the policy formula with the cheapest equivalent product: 5,680 ÷ 7,700 = 0.737. Given similar codec support and longer single-charge playback on Sonic (up to 15 h vs. 11 h spec on HP‑V500BT), the cost-performance is moderate but not poor in Japan.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As an established company operating since 1996, radius demonstrates reasonable longevity. The HP‑V500BT is rated IPX4 [2]. However, international presence and support are limited outside Japan, and user feedback for HP‑V500BT on Amazon JP is mixed (3.2/5 across 46 ratings; 34% are 1‑star as of 2025‑08‑12) [3], which tempers the reliability assessment for general consumers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Radius pursues rational design directions focusing on measurable audio improvements through dual-driver implementations and high-quality codec support. The lineup includes products aimed at situational awareness and comfort (e.g., ear‑hug/open designs) for specific use cases. The emphasis on the Japanese market over global standardization represents a mixed but understandable approach to design rationality.

## Advice

Consider radius products if seeking unique Japanese audio engineering with distinctive features like DDM dual-driver technology or compact wireless designs. The HP‑R100BT offers solid value for LDAC/aptX HD support at modest pricing. However, buyers prioritizing price-to-features (e.g., aptX Adaptive plus long battery life) should also evaluate alternatives like SOUNDPEATS Sonic or Anker/Sony entries available in Japan, which can offer lower prices and broader retail presence.
