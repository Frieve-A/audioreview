## Overview

Anker is a Chinese technology company established in 2011 that entered the audio field with its Soundcore brand. Leveraging technical expertise cultivated through chargers and mobile batteries, the company develops cost-performance focused wireless earbuds and Bluetooth speakers. As of 2025, Anker boasts a wide product lineup including flagship models like Soundcore Liberty 5 and P40i, gaining particular attention for noise-cancelling technology and long battery life in the 10,000 yen price range.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Anker's technical audio quality improvements include proprietary technologies like BassUp Technology and spatial audio algorithms, but detailed measurement data disclosure is limited. Frequency response claims standard 20Hz-20kHz range, but specific measurement data such as THD and SNR values are not publicly available. The adoption of titanium drivers to minimize sound distortion is commendable, but scientific evidence documentation and objective measurement results from third-party institutions are insufficient. LDAC-compatible models enable transmission of up to 3 times more information, but actual sound quality improvement effects require blind test verification.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Anker's technology centers mainly on product development through combining existing products, with limited fundamental acoustic technology innovation. The adoption of bass-reflex speakers, titanium drivers, and implementation of dual passive radiators efficiently combines proven technologies. The proprietary BassUp Technology shows certain effectiveness in bass enhancement but remains within industry standard technology scope. 2025 flagship models maintain industry average standards in function integration aspects with Dolby Audio support and wireless charging compatibility.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Anker's greatest strength lies in high cost-performance. Soundcore P40i (7,990 yen) achieves approximately 0.67 price ratio against equivalent function Sony and JBL competitive products (12,000-15,000 yen). Liberty 5 (14,990 yen) achieves 0.6 price ratio compared to Sony WF-1000XM4 (25,000 yen) with equivalent noise-cancelling functionality. The 10,000 yen range noise-cancelling technology "Ultra Noise Cancelling 2.0" demonstrates performance comparable to Sony's former high-end models, providing the highest level cost-performance within the product category.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Anker provides standard 18-month product warranty, extendable to 24 months through member registration. Exchange and repair response for product defects is prompt, with domestic support systems properly established. However, specific data on failure rates and MTBF are not publicly available. Firmware update support through the Soundcore app is implemented, but continuity of long-term software support has limited track record. Considering the price range, industry average level support systems are provided.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Anker's design philosophy follows an approach of "providing high performance at low prices," prioritizing cost-performance over sound quality improvement. Design emphasizing practicality such as maximizing battery life and improving waterproof performance is rational. However, in sound quality aspects, there's a bass-heavy tendency seen in "BassUp" technology, making it unsuitable for applications requiring flat acoustic characteristics. The necessity of existing as dedicated audio equipment is limited to combinations of long battery life and waterproof performance. Sound quality comparison with smartphone + external DAC shows unclear advantages.

## Advice

Anker realizes the concept of "cheap, good sound, and durable," representing a cost-performance focused audio brand. When considering completely wireless earbuds within a 10,000 yen budget, Soundcore P40i becomes a viable option. It's particularly suitable for users prioritizing long battery life (maximum 192 hours) and waterproof performance. However, compromises in sound quality aspects are unavoidable, making it unsuitable for Hi-Fi audio applications. Noise-cancelling functionality demonstrates excellent performance for the 10,000 yen range, but clear sound quality differences exist with premium audio brands. While recommendable for demographics prioritizing cost-performance and practicality, audio purists should consider other alternatives.
