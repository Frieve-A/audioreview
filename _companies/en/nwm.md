## Overview

nwm (“New Wave Maker”) is the consumer audio brand of NTT sonority, launched in 2022, with a portfolio centered on open-ear listening using the company’s PSZ (Personalized Sound Zone) and Magic Focus Voice technologies [3][4]. The flagship **nwm ONE** is a wireless open-ear on-ear model with a two-way driver system (35 mm woofer + 12 mm tweeter), rated 40 Hz–20 kHz, Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio/LC3, and about 20 hours playback; US list price is 299 USD [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

PSZ aims to reduce sound leakage by emitting inverse-phase waves around the ear, a mechanism that is physically plausible and clearly described by the manufacturer [4]. For the nwm ONE, key published specs include a 12 mm + 35 mm dual-driver array, 40 Hz–20 kHz response, Bluetooth 5.3 profiles, and LC3/AAC/SBC codec support [1]. However, independent third-party measurements (e.g., headphone FR tolerance, THD vs SPL, quantified leakage reduction in dB) have not yet been published, so audible transparency relative to closed or sealing designs is unverified. On balance, with credible engineering but limited external data, we place scientific validity slightly above the unknown baseline.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

nwm’s stack combines proprietary **PSZ** sound-zone control and **Magic Focus Voice** beamforming/noise filtering with a multi-amp DSP architecture in the ONE, plus modern LE Audio features (LC3, Auracast, multipoint) [1][4]. This reflects genuine in-house development beyond commodity open-ear form factors. While publication volume/patent disclosure is modest versus larger audio incumbents, the implementation breadth (drivers, DSP, voice processing) and recency merit a high-mid score.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**Price basis:** nwm ONE 299 USD (US site) [1].

**Cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative (user perspective):** **Nothing Ear (open)** at **99 USD** on the official US store. It provides open-ear listening, dual connection support, and an **IP54** rating (nwm ONE’s IP rating is not specified), with total battery life up to 30 h including case; strict acoustic measurements are limited, so this equivalence is provisional and based on functions/ratings [2].  
**Calculation:** 99 USD ÷ 299 USD = **0.331… → 0.3** (rounded to 1 decimal).  
For context, **Shokz OpenFit 2** (open-ear earbuds, IP55, up to 11 h per charge / 48 h with case) is 139.95 USD on Shokz US [5], further underscoring downward price pressure.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Brand history in consumer audio is short (founded 2022) [3]. Warranty in the US is **one year** [5], which is below the two-year benchmark many competitors offer. Firmware/app support exists via the **nwm Connect** app, but long-term update cadence and global service footprint are not yet established [1]. With limited field longevity data, we score slightly below average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Prioritizing situational awareness with open-ear products is coherent for safety and comfort, and PSZ is a rational attempt to curb leakage [4]. Still, open-ear designs inherently sacrifice isolation—often a prerequisite for high-fidelity reproduction at the eardrum—and nwm’s premium pricing is aimed more at convenience/UX than measured transparency. Until rigorous third-party acoustical results are available, the design direction reads as lifestyle-oriented rather than fidelity-maximizing.

## Advice

If you specifically want **open-ear** listening with reduced leakage, nwm is a credible innovator to watch, and ONE’s dual-driver/LE Audio feature set is attractive [1][4]. For most buyers, however, the **price delta** versus established open-ear options is substantial: Nothing Ear (open) at 99 USD and Shokz OpenFit 2 at 139.95 USD deliver similar user-facing outcomes (awareness, lightness, water resistance) [2][5]. We recommend waiting for independent measurements of ONE’s frequency response, distortion, and leakage attenuation to justify its premium—or consider the cheaper alternatives first.
