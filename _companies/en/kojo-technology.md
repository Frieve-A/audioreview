## Overview

KOJO Technology (brand of **Kojo Seiko Co., Ltd.**) is a Japanese manufacturer established in 1990 and headquartered in Hirakawa City, Aomori. It focuses on grounding accessories such as “virtual ground” boxes and cables for high-end audio systems. The Crystal E/E-G boxes use multi-layer dissimilar-metal stacks and advertise very large effective conductor surface areas (the Crystal E-G claims a total *~68,000 cm²*), but the company publishes no evidence of corresponding improvements in standard audio metrics. [4][5][6][7][8][9]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Independent, measurement-focused evaluations of comparable “signal grounding” boxes have not demonstrated objective, positive changes in THD, noise/SNR, frequency response, or crosstalk; one well-known bench test on an Entreq unit found **no useful current flow** and **introduced spurious noise peaks** when connected. KOJO’s own materials list construction details (layer counts, materials, surface-area claims) but **do not** provide standardized audio-performance deltas. In the absence of credible, third-party evidence of audible or measurable benefits, scientific support remains very weak. [1][5][6][7]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Build execution is competent for a passive accessory: Crystal E uses an **8-layer** metal stack (stainless/brass/copper), dual **M4** ground terminals, and a compact, heavy chassis (**~775 g; 80 × 111 × 35 mm**). The limited-edition E-G version adds etched plates and internal capacitor modules. Despite the careful mechanical work, the core concept lacks demonstrated efficacy on audio performance, so the engineering value is average within this niche. [5][6][7]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Representative market prices (USD): **Crystal E** ~**379.99 USD**; **Crystal E-G** ~**699.99 USD**. A **measured** and widely recommended way to address actual ground-related noise is a **line-level isolation transformer**, e.g., **Jensen ISO-MAX CI-1RR**, which shows transparent performance in bench tests and retails around **139.99 USD**. Using Crystal E as the representative KOJO product:

- Comparator (equal or better function/performance): Jensen ISO-MAX CI-1RR (measured isolation, low distortion/noise) → **139.99 USD**. [2][3][7][10][11]  
- Target: KOJO Crystal E → **379.99 USD**. [2]

**CP = MIN(1.0, 139.99 ÷ 379.99) = 0.4**.  
(For context, the E-G at 699.99 USD against the same comparator would yield **0.2**, but we base the company score on the mainstream Crystal E.) [2][3][7][10][11]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The firm has operated since **1990** and builds largely passive, low-complexity products that should be physically robust. However, we found no transparent data for failure rates, warranty terms, or international service responsiveness. The company’s physical presence appears Japan-centric, which may affect global support. [4][8][9]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

The portfolio prioritizes elaborate “virtual ground” mechanics and surface-area claims over **verifiable** audio-performance outcomes. Without controlled, reproducible improvements, the design approach does not align with transparent, measurement-driven audio engineering, and risks confusing buyers with technically irrelevant metrics. [1][5][6][7]

## Advice

If you are chasing lower noise floors or hum removal, prefer **proven** methods: proper system grounding practices, balanced interconnects, and **measured** isolation transformers or differential interfaces (e.g., Jensen ISO-MAX). These deliver predictable, testable results at a fraction of KOJO’s price points. [10][11]
