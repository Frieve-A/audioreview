## Overview

Cafe au Label Studio is an independent Tokyo-based recording studio and audio equipment maker. Under the AMATERAS JAPAN label, the company builds passive devices such as the “NEVE-KUN” line transformers (1- and 2-channel, with OEP/Carnhill or Lundahl options) and sells them directly through its online store [1][2].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For the AMATERAS “NEVE-KUN” line transformer 0002 (2-ch), the official store lists frequency response 20 Hz–20 kHz and maximum input level +24 dBu; THD/IMD/crosstalk/noise metrics are not published [1]. In the absence of third-party measurements, audible transparency beyond catalog specs cannot be established. Following the rule for unknown key measurements, the score anchors at 0.5 pending independent data [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The products apply established transformer-coupled passive isolation using OEP/Carnhill or Lundahl transformers in simple 1-/2-channel enclosures. This is competent engineering for galvanic isolation and ground-loop mitigation, but there is no evidence of novel circuits, patents, or measurement breakthroughs. Thus, above average for craft execution, not cutting-edge [1][2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

**Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (function & measurements):** ART DTI Dual Transformer/Isolator (2-ch passive line isolator). Published specs: 10 Hz–50 kHz (±0.5 dB @ +4 dBu), THD 0.01% @ 1 kHz +18 dBu, and <0.05% @ 100 Hz with **+24 dBu** signal—demonstrating operation at the same nominal level as AMATERAS; multi-I/O (XLR/TRS/RCA) [3]. Current US-site street price observed: **77 USD** [4]. AMATERAS 0002 store page shows **46,800円 (318.24 USD estimate)** [1].  
**CP calculation**: 77 USD ÷ 318.24 USD = 0.2419… → **0.2** (to one decimal) [1][3][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

No explicit warranty terms were found on the AMATERAS 0002 store page as of August 2025 [1]. As a small direct-sales operation, international service infrastructure appears limited relative to major pro-audio vendors. For context, Radial publicly lists a transferable 3-year limited warranty across products [5]. Given the absence of published AMATERAS warranty/MTBF/RMA data, we set a conservative score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Passive transformer isolation is a rational approach for hum-breaking and galvanic isolation. However, marketing emphasis on “analog warmth/saturation” without corroborating transparency measurements places the philosophy more on voicing and craft than measurement-driven fidelity. The design is practical, but objective justification remains limited [1][2].

## Advice

If you value a compact passive transformer insert from a small maker with OEP/Carnhill or Lundahl choices, AMATERAS can be appealing. If you prioritize measurable performance per dollar and broader support, a well-specified stereo isolator like **ART DTI** offers verified wideband response and low distortion at a substantially lower US price; mainstream options such as Radial SB-6 remain strong but are pricier [3][4][6].
