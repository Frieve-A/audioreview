## Overview

ACTIVO is a digital audio player (DAP) specialist company established in 2019 as a sub-brand of Astell&Kern, operated by South Korea's Dreamus Group. The company aims to provide Astell&Kern's audio technology at more affordable prices, targeting users with active lifestyles. Its current flagship product is the ACTIVO P1 (429 USD), released in July 2024. A previous model, the CT10 (299 USD), has been discontinued.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The measurement performance of the ACTIVO P1 is scientifically excellent. Its THD+N of 0.0004% (Balanced), S/N ratio of 124 dB (Balanced), and Crosstalk of -145 dB (Balanced) all significantly surpass the policy's transparency thresholds (THD+N ≤0.01%, SNR ≥105 dB, Crosstalk ≤-70 dB). This is achieved by implementing dual Cirrus Logic "CS43198" MasterHIFI DACs, optimized with Astell&Kern's "TERATON ALPHA" sound solution. As a result, any distortion or noise in the audible range is suppressed to a level imperceptible to the human ear.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The design is solid, featuring a dual configuration of Cirrus Logic's high-performance CS43198 DACs, centered around the TERATON ALPHA sound solution inherited from Astell&Kern. The approach of using a dedicated circuit to pursue sound quality, rather than relying on the DAC chip's built-in amplifier, is technically sound. However, these technologies are already in use by the parent brand and cannot be considered unique innovations of ACTIVO. From an industry-wide perspective, the technology level is slightly above average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The ACTIVO P1 (429 USD) faces a cost-performance challenge when compared to competitors offering equivalent or superior functionality and measurement performance. For instance, the Tempotec V3, which features dual AK4493SEQ DACs and supports comparable streaming services, is available for 199 USD. The cost-performance calculation is `199 USD ÷ 429 USD ≈ 0.46`, which rounds to 0.5. While the P1's performance is excellent, the existence of an alternative with similar performance at nearly half the price means its price competitiveness must be rated as low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Users have reported multiple issues with the support system of the parent company, Astell&Kern. As of 2024, complaints about "no email response for weeks" and "inadequate phone support" persist, raising serious concerns about customer service quality. The warranty period is one year, but reports suggest that service is primarily repair-based and tends to be a time-consuming process. While data specific to the ACTIVO brand is limited, the support issues of its parent company cannot be ignored.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The design philosophy, which emphasizes measurement performance to achieve transparent sound quality, is scientifically rational. The technical approach of using dual Cirrus Logic MasterHIFI DACs driven by a dedicated amplifier circuit is commendable as it contributes to sound quality improvement. On the other hand, the DAP product category itself faces challenges in demonstrating a definitive advantage over the combination of a smartphone and a high-performance external DAC. Nevertheless, the commitment to pursuing audio quality as a dedicated device is consistent.

## Advice

The ACTIVO P1, viewed in isolation, is a DAP with scientifically excellent measurement performance. However, prospective buyers should be aware of competitors like the Tempotec V3, which offer comparable or better performance at a lower price. For users who prioritize cost-performance, better options exist. Furthermore, considering the history of the parent company Astell&Kern's support system, there are legitimate concerns about after-sales service. The P1 is a viable option only for those who prioritize top-tier measurement performance and are willing to accept the higher price and potential long-term support risks.
