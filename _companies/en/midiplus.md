## Overview

MIDIPLUS is a Taiwanese manufacturer specializing in USB audio interfaces, MIDI keyboard controllers, and related music production equipment. Operating as an independent brand under Ta Horng Musical Instrument Co., Ltd., the company focuses on developing affordable MIDI-related products for the global market. Their audio interface lineup includes the Studio S, Studio M, Routist RS, and Audioface 1 models, targeting entry-level home recording and streaming applications. The company emphasizes portability and cost-effectiveness in their design approach, offering basic audio interface functionality at competitive price points.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

MIDIPLUS audio interfaces present specifications that require careful evaluation due to limited independent verification. The Studio S model claims impressive specifications including 20Hz-20kHz ±0.2dB frequency response, effectively unmeasurable THD+N levels, <-127dB equivalent input noise, and -107dB crosstalk [1]. The Studio M offers 24-bit/96kHz sampling with 104dB dynamic range and -98dB THD+N [2]. The Audioface 1 shows more conservative specs with 10Hz-20kHz ±1dB frequency response and -90dB THD [3]. These manufacturer specifications lack independent third-party measurement verification from recognized testing organizations. Applying conservative evaluation per transparent level guidelines due to absence of verified data, with 0.1 adjustment toward 0.5 for unverified claims. The specification variance across models and absence of credible third-party validation necessitates cautious assessment of claimed performance levels.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

MIDIPLUS employs conventional USB audio interface technology with contemporary standards support including 24-bit/192kHz sampling, USB Audio Class compliance, and ASIO driver compatibility. Products utilize standard OEM/ODM designs without significant proprietary technology or technical differentiation. The implementation represents appropriate digital-analog integration for budget audio interfaces but lacks innovation or competitive advantage. Construction appears to rely on established reference designs rather than proprietary engineering solutions. Technology adoption focuses on proven approaches rather than cutting-edge development, resulting in products that are easy for competitors to match.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The Studio S provides basic audio interface functionality in a compact package. Equipped with 2-input/2-output configuration, XLR/TRS combo inputs with 48V phantom power, and 24-bit/192kHz sampling capabilities. Current market research indicates the Studio S retails for approximately 130 USD through various international retailers [1]. Comprehensive market investigation was conducted to identify equivalent products with matching specifications (2×XLR/TRS combo inputs, 24-bit/192kHz, 48V phantom power) available under 130 USD with verified measured performance data. No single equivalent product meeting these criteria was identified. Available alternatives either lack functional equivalence (insufficient input count) or exceed the price threshold (PreSonus Studio 24c: 149-179 USD). Following policy guidelines, Studio S is treated as the cheapest equivalent option in its specification category, resulting in CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

MIDIPLUS offers standard manufacturer warranty coverage with email-based technical support through support@midiplus.com.tw [5]. The company provides limited global support infrastructure, relying primarily on dealer networks for customer assistance. Construction quality reflects budget-oriented design with simple circuitry and minimal moving parts, though long-term reliability data is unavailable for this relatively new brand in audio interface market. Support documentation is basic, and firmware update policies are unclear for applicable products. The company lacks the established service infrastructure and track record of major audio interface manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

MIDIPLUS demonstrates measurement-focused approach in product specifications, emphasizing quantifiable parameters like THD+N, frequency response, and dynamic range. The design philosophy centers on cost-effective delivery of essential audio interface functionality without unnecessary complexity. Product progression shows advancement from earlier models to the Studio S with higher sampling rates and improved specifications. However, the approach remains conservative, relying heavily on standard OEM designs rather than innovative solutions. The company's focus on portability and affordability aligns with market demand but offers limited technical differentiation. Design decisions appear rational for budget constraints but lack the innovation necessary for competitive advantage in the evolving audio interface market.

## Advice

MIDIPLUS audio interfaces serve as entry-level options for users requiring basic USB audio interface functionality. Cost-performance analysis reveals that in Studio S's specific specification category (2×XLR/TRS combo inputs, 24-bit/192kHz, 48V phantom power), no verified equivalent products under 130 USD with confirmed measured performance data could be identified. Lower-priced alternatives either lack functional equivalence or have insufficient measurement validation, while higher-performance alternatives exceed the price threshold. For established reliability, the Focusrite Scarlett series provides proven performance with comprehensive driver support and professional build quality, though in a different price category. MIDIPLUS products offer competitive pricing for specific specification requirements, though the absence of independent measurement verification makes objective performance assessment challenging.
