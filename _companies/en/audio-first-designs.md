## Overview

Audio First Designs Ltd, incorporated on August 13, 2024, represents a newly established UK company specializing in high-performance audio DIY speaker kits. Located in Cambridge, England, the company operates under the leadership of designer Harry Young, who brings significant industry experience from previous roles at KEF and Celestion following his MSc from Salford University. The company's mission centers on "achieving exceptional sound quality through world-class engineering and acoustic designs." Their flagship product, the Fidelia DIY speaker kit, demonstrates professional development standards through the use of Klippel Near-Field Scanner measurement systems, typically found only in established professional audio companies. Despite being operational for approximately three months as of this review, Audio First Designs positions itself in the premium DIY market segment.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Third-party measurements from Erin's Audio Corner describe the Fidelia as "extremely linear and accurate" and assess it as "one of the best-measuring and best-sounding kits" reviewed [1]. Specific measurement details show sensitivity of 83.5 dB (measured), F3 at 53 Hz, F10 at 38 Hz, with bass extension reaching approximately 50 Hz in-room, exceeding the specified 42 Hz lower limit. Horizontal radiation pattern is approximately ±70°, providing consistent directivity with smooth driver handoff at the 1560 Hz crossover point. Harmonic Distortion measurements were conducted at 86 dB and 96 dB, with midrange distortion increasing above 96 dB [1]. Dynamic Range measurements show approximately 3-4 dB dynamic range loss at higher volumes [1]. The review notes a slight bump around 5-6 kHz that can add mild sibilance. However, complete numerical data for THD and SNR are not publicly available, limiting comprehensive evaluation based on speaker category criteria (THD: 0.1% or below excellent, 1% or above problematic).

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The Fidelia demonstrates high technical advancement through proprietary innovations. The in-house developed waveguide with low diffraction technology enables consistent 120° directivity and allows the crossover frequency to be pushed to an remarkably low 1560 Hz. Ceramic-aluminum drivers provide maximum rigidity and non-resonant operation in their bandwidth, maximizing time-domain fidelity. The crossover utilizes exclusively high-quality components including Jantzen film capacitors from Denmark, air-core inductors, and non-inductive wire wound resistors to minimize component distortion. This technology integration represents sophisticated engineering that would require significant time for competitors to replicate, leveraging the founder's expertise from working at established audio brands including KEF's award-winning designs.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The Fidelia is priced at 1,508 USD (converted from £1,140 at current exchange rate) and provides 2-way passive bookshelf configuration with 83.5 dB sensitivity (measured, 1m/2.83V), F3 53 Hz, F10 38 Hz, horizontal radiation ±70°, 4Ω impedance, and third-party assessed "extremely linear and accurate" performance. The Philharmonic Ceramic Mini at 810 USD is equipped with equivalent 2-way passive bookshelf configuration with ceramic drivers, 82.2 dB sensitivity (measured), on-axis linearity ±2.5 dB, horizontal radiation ±70-80°, impedance (4Ω), and low midrange distortion, providing equivalent-or-better performance in frequency response and distortion characteristics than the review target [3][4]. CP = 810 USD ÷ 1,508 USD = 0.537, rounded to 0.5. The price premium reflects the proprietary waveguide technology, premium components, and boutique manufacturing approach, though significantly cheaper alternatives exist that deliver comparable functionality and measured performance.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The Fidelia benefits from robust construction using Finnish birch plywood cabinets and high-quality ceramic-aluminum drivers designed for durability. The passive speaker structure with pre-assembled crossovers reduces potential failure points during assembly. Audio First Designs includes comprehensive assembly templates and QC checklists to ensure proper construction. However, as a relatively new UK company with limited manufacturing history, long-term reliability data is unavailable. The founder's professional track record at established audio brands provides confidence in design quality, though support infrastructure likely relies on dealer networks rather than direct manufacturer support systems typical of larger companies.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Audio First Designs demonstrates rational design philosophy with measurement-focused scientific approach to sound quality improvement. The company explicitly states goals of "rendering recordings as faithfully as possible" while minimizing "unwanted distortion in the signal chain," representing evidence-based engineering rather than subjective audiophile approaches. Design costs directly contribute to measurable performance improvements through proprietary waveguide technology, premium components, and innovative ultra-low crossover implementation. The founder's professional background and engineering expertise at respected audio companies ensures technically sound design decisions. This rational approach emphasizes objective performance metrics over traditional audiophile mythology, focusing on achievable improvements in frequency response, directivity control, and distortion reduction.

## Advice

Audio First Designs serves users prioritizing professional measurement verification and premium construction quality. The Fidelia targets experienced DIY enthusiasts seeking premium performance with proprietary technology integration. The kit's exceptional engineering and measured performance justify consideration for those prioritizing technical innovation and build quality. While there is a price premium compared to equivalent-performing alternatives, the differential is reasonable when compared to similarly-specified speakers with comparable waveguide technology. This makes it suitable for enthusiasts who value the unique ultra-low crossover design and artisanal construction approach. Potential buyers should have comfortable DIY assembly experience and access to appropriate amplification, as the 84dB sensitivity requires adequate power for higher listening levels. Those seeking pure cost-performance optimization should consider mass-produced alternatives, while those valuing innovative engineering and supporting boutique audio development will find the Fidelia represents state-of-the-art DIY speaker design with competitive pricing within its performance tier.
