## Overview

PS Audio is an American high-end audio manufacturer founded in 1973 by Paul McGowan and Stan Warren. Headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, the company has been manufacturing high-quality audio equipment for nearly 50 years. They are particularly known as innovators in digital audio technology, leading the industry with their "DirectStream" series built around proprietary DSD upsampling technology.

Their product lineup, centered around the DirectStream DAC MK2 (8,000 USD) and AirLens streamer (1,999 USD), has earned high praise for its unique technology that upsamples all digital inputs to DSD at 20x speed and converts them to pure analog output. Their design philosophy of enabling continuous performance improvement through firmware updates is also distinctive.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The DSD upsampling technology employed by PS Audio theoretically has the potential to reduce noise and distortion through a different approach than multibit PCM processing. However, this theoretical advantage has not translated into superior measured performance in their final products.

In reality, the measured performance (THD+N, etc.) of the DirectStream DAC falls far short of the SINAD 120dB+ specifications achieved by modern multibit DACs (such as Topping products). The fact that even after complex DSD conversion processing, they are objectively inferior in performance to simpler and cheaper DAC designs raises questions about the practical effectiveness of this approach.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

PS Audio's technical level is high, particularly at the forefront of digital signal processing technology. The DirectStream architecture adopts a fundamentally different approach from conventional chipset DACs (AKM or ESS Sabre) through its unique FPGA-based design. This technology enables continuous performance improvement through firmware updates.

Additionally, the upsampling processing to 20x speed DSD requires sophisticated computational processing, and its implementation demands considerable technical expertise. The network noise elimination technology in the AirLens streamer can also be evaluated as a technical solution to modern digital audio challenges.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Cost-performance must be rated as extremely poor. Even the unique "DSD conversion" technology cannot be considered added value unless the final measured performance justifies the price. Based on pure specification comparison, the evaluation is calculated as follows:

- **DirectStream DAC MK2 (8,000 USD)**: Compared to the `Topping D90SE` (approximately 800 USD) with equivalent or superior measured performance, CP = 800 ÷ 8,000 = **0.1**.
- **AirLens Streamer (1,999 USD)**: Compared to a `Raspberry Pi 4`-based streamer (approximately 200 USD) with equivalent network functionality, CP = 200 ÷ 1,999 ≈ **0.1**.

Even if one resonates with the unique technology and philosophy, the fact remains that the objective performance-to-price ratio is remarkably low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

PS Audio's reliability and support are highly regarded in the industry. With 50 years of track record since founding, there are no major reported issues regarding product durability. Particularly noteworthy is their long-term support structure through firmware updates, with the DirectStream series receiving continuous performance improvements even after release.

Customer support is also comprehensive, providing detailed assistance from technical questions to setup procedures. Founder Paul McGowan remains actively engaged in customer communication, demonstrating the company's strong sense of responsibility and commitment to support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

PS Audio's design philosophy is based on the clear goal of "providing the ultimate digital audio experience" and adopts technically rational approaches. The pursuit of sound quality improvement through DSD upsampling is a legitimate technical development direction with theoretical foundation.

The concept of continuous improvement through firmware updates is also modern and rational. However, there is room for debate regarding the magnitude of these effects and the justification for their premium pricing. While technical superiority is acknowledged, the approach cannot be considered completely rational from a cost-effectiveness perspective.

## Advice

PS Audio products are ideal for enthusiasts who want to experience the latest digital audio technology or users who wish to enjoy upgrades over the long term. Particularly for those who value continuous performance improvement through firmware updates, they offer unique appeal unavailable from other manufacturers.

- **Digital Audio Enthusiasts**: Users interested in DSD upsampling technology or FPGA-based unique designs
- **Long-term Ownership Oriented**: Users expecting continuous improvement through firmware updates
- **High-end Oriented**: Users who prioritize technical innovation and musical appeal over measured values

However, they are not recommended for users who prioritize pure measured performance or price-to-performance ratio. Products with equivalent basic performance are available at 1/10th the price. It is important to audition before purchase and confirm that their unique sonic characteristics and technical approach align with your values.
