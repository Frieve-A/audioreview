## Overview

OASA Electronics (Oasa Denshi Co., Ltd.) is a Japanese audio equipment manufacturer based in Hiroshima Prefecture. Leveraging 20 years of OEM manufacturing experience, they launched their own brand "Egretta" in Japan in 2011 and began overseas expansion in 2017. Their main products are omnidirectional (360-degree) speakers, particularly compact products for desktop use. The TS-A200 series features a unique acoustic design combining Heil-type tweeters with dome-type woofers using modified lignin materials.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

OASA Electronics' products adopt the special design of omnidirectional speakers, but their acoustic superiority is limited. The TS-A200 series has a frequency response of 80Hz-45kHz, but the 80Hz low-frequency reproduction limit is insufficient by modern standards, requiring a subwoofer. While omnidirectional speakers have advantages in sound dispersion, they present problems from a high-fidelity reproduction perspective, including phase issues and image ambiguity due to reflected sound. The company's claimed material innovations like "modified lignin" and "polymer clay composite" lack measurement data showing clear advantages in the audible range, resulting in low scientific validity.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

As a company with 20 years of OEM experience, OASA possesses certain technical capabilities, but these are limited compared to industry standards. The adoption of Heil-type tweeters and dome drivers using modified lignin represents attempts at different approaches, which is commendable. However, scientific verification of how much these technologies contribute to sound quality improvement is lacking, with no visible technical achievements in patents or papers. The omnidirectional speaker design itself is not novel, and it falls short of the technical standards of existing manufacturers like MBL and German Physiks. The technology level is rated at approximately the industry average.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The cost-performance of OASA Electronics' TS-A200as (street price 217,800 JPY) needs careful evaluation within the niche omnidirectional desktop speaker market. A key performance competitor is the Ohm MicroWalsh Short, which offers superior low-frequency reproduction (down to 52Hz). By combining these speakers (approx. 127,000 JPY / 800 USD per pair) with an inexpensive, high-performance amplifier like the Fosi Audio V3 (approx. 21,000 JPY), it is possible to build an omnidirectional system with better low-frequency performance than the TS-A200as for a total of about 148,000 JPY. Based on this, the cost-performance calculation is `148,000 JPY ÷ 217,800 JPY ≈ 0.68`, resulting in a score of 0.7. While significantly more affordable than high-end options from MBL, this rating reflects the existence of more rational alternatives that can achieve comparable or superior performance at a lower price.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

As a domestic Japanese manufacturer, OASA maintains appropriate support systems and has quality control based on 20 years of OEM experience. With manufacturing facilities in Hiroshima Prefecture, they have established official sales channels through Yahoo! Shopping and Amazon. While warranty periods and repair systems are presumed to maintain standard levels, their track record as an emerging brand is still limited. Compared to major manufacturers, there are concerns about sales networks and long-term support, but basic reliability as a domestic manufacturer is secured.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The omnidirectional speaker design philosophy has certain rationality in terms of sound dispersion and listening fatigue reduction. The approach of widening the sweet spot for desktop use is reasonable and suitable for use in narrow spaces. However, from the perspective of sound imaging precision and measurement performance optimization, it has inferior aspects compared to conventional directional speakers. The materials engineering approach (modified lignin and polymer clay composite) is interesting, but scientific verification of its effects is insufficient. While rational as a niche market specialization strategy, it has limitations in both versatility and performance.

## Advice

OASA Electronics is an audio manufacturer with a unique approach, leveraging Japanese manufacturing capabilities. For those specifically seeking omnidirectional desktop speakers who value Japanese quality, it may be a choice to consider. However, potential buyers must understand that omnidirectional speakers involve inherent compromises in imaging precision compared to conventional designs. Furthermore, with a low-frequency limit of 80Hz, the TS-A200 series requires subwoofer integration for full-range reproduction. From a cost-performance perspective, a configuration combining Ohm MicroWalsh Short speakers with a separate amplifier can deliver superior performance at a lower cost, making the TS-A200 series less competitive. The company would benefit from publishing detailed measurement data to better substantiate its technical claims.
