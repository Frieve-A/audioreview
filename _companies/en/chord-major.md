## Overview

Chord & Major is a Taiwanese in-ear monitor company established in the early 2010s, creating what they term "Tonal Earphones" - models allegedly tuned for specific music genres including Rock, Classical, Jazz, World Music, and Electronic. The company's lineup includes Major 8'13 Rock (200 USD), Major 9'13 Classical (219 USD), Major 01'16 Electronic (230 USD), Major 7'13 Jazz, and Major 5'14 World models. Each features dynamic drivers housed in stainless steel with various wood wrappings (rosewood, sandalwood) and premium presentation boxes. Their core philosophy centers on genre-specific acoustic optimization, though this approach lacks scientific measurement validation.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Scientific validity cannot be properly evaluated due to insufficient measurement data and lack of independent verification. Investigation findings reveal that while manufacturer specifications show frequency response ranges of 20-20,000Hz for most models (01'16 Electronic: 5-40,000Hz) and sensitivity of 94-103dB, critical audio quality metrics remain undisclosed. No THD, SNR, IMD, crosstalk, or passive isolation measurements are provided by the manufacturer. Comprehensive research across major measurement platforms including Audio Science Review, Erin's Audio Corner, and SoundStage! Network found no credible third-party measurements for any Chord Major products. The company's "Tonal Earphone" claims for genre-specific acoustic optimization lack any published measurement evidence or ABX blind test validation. According to evaluation policy, when measurement data is unavailable and manufacturer specifications lack audio-quality-relevant information, conservative scoring applies with Scientific Validity set to 0.5, pending availability of independent verification data.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Technology level represents basic dynamic driver implementation without significant innovation. Most models employ simple single dynamic drivers with standard stainless steel housing construction. The company demonstrates in-house design capabilities but relies exclusively on mature, analog-only technology without digital signal processing, advanced driver configurations, or cutting-edge materials science. The "Tonal Earphone" concept represents marketing differentiation rather than technical advancement, as genre-specific tuning through passive acoustic methods offers no measurable competitive advantage. Only the 01'16 Electronic features dual dynamic drivers, marginally exceeding the basic single-driver approach. No proprietary patents, technical papers, or industry-leading innovations are documented. The approach remains conservative without integration of modern technologies like DSP, wireless capabilities, or software-based optimization.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Cost-performance evaluation based on Major 9'13 Classical at 219 USD demonstrates extremely poor value proposition. Comparison target 7Hz Salnotes Zero 2 at 25 USD provides equivalent-or-better specifications and measured performance. Equipped with basic stereo IEM functionality and 3.5mm wired connectivity, the comparison target demonstrates superior technical specifications: 10Hz-20,000Hz frequency response versus 20Hz-20,000Hz, 108dB/V@1kHz sensitivity versus 96dB, and 32Ω impedance versus 21Ω. Audio Science Review measurements confirm the Zero 2's excellent technical performance with flat frequency response, low distortion (<1% THD), and proper driver implementation using 10mm dynamic driver with PU+Metal composite diaphragm [4]. In contrast, no credible third-party measurements exist for Chord Major products to validate their claimed specifications. CP calculation: 25 USD ÷ 219 USD = 0.114, rounded to 0.1. Premium materials like rosewood presentation boxes contribute to costs without measurable performance improvements, resulting in exceptionally poor cost-performance where basic functionality commands significant price premiums over scientifically validated alternatives.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Reliability and support infrastructure appears limited with basic warranty coverage below industry standards. The company provides 1-year warranty protection, which falls short of the typical 2-year industry standard. Construction utilizes simple dynamic driver designs with few moving parts, inherently providing structural robustness against mechanical failure. However, support infrastructure relies primarily on dealer-based assistance without comprehensive global manufacturer support systems. No documented repair response capabilities, firmware update support, or specialized customer service programs are available. Company history spans approximately one decade with limited track record data regarding long-term product reliability or failure rates. The Taiwanese manufacturing base provides reasonable quality control but lacks extensive service network infrastructure for international markets.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Design philosophy demonstrates significant irrationality through emphasis on subjective genre-specific tuning without scientific validation. The company's core "Tonal Earphone" concept claims audible optimization for specific music genres including Rock, Classical, and Jazz, but provides no measurement evidence supporting these claims. Marketing materials emphasize premium wood materials (rosewood, sandalwood) and aesthetic presentation rather than measurable performance improvements. This approach contradicts measurement-focused scientific methodology by prioritizing subjective tuning over objective acoustic optimization. No justification exists for genre-specific models when general-purpose IEMs with flat frequency response provide superior versatility. Investment in premium materials and elaborate packaging represents meaningless cost allocation relative to acoustic function. The conservative analog-only approach avoids beneficial technologies like DSP equalization that could provide genuine user-customizable frequency response optimization with scientific precision.

## Advice

Chord Major products cannot be recommended based on objective audio quality and value considerations. The 219-300 USD price range positions these products against significantly superior alternatives like 7Hz Salnotes Zero 2 (25 USD) or Moondrop Aria (80 USD) that provide equivalent or better measured performance. The genre-specific tuning concept lacks scientific foundation, as properly designed neutral IEMs with optional equalization provide superior flexibility for all music types. Prospective buyers seeking premium aesthetics should consider that wood materials and presentation boxes contribute nothing to audio quality while dramatically increasing costs. For users prioritizing measured performance and value, numerous alternatives at fraction of the price deliver superior technical specifications with credible third-party validation.
