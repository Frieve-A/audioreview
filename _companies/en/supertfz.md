## Overview

SuperTFZ (sometimes sold under the TFZ umbrella) produces single-dynamic in-ear monitors primarily under ~150 USD. Notable recent models include FORCE1 and FORCE King. The brand’s marketing often highlights “Tesla magnetic” motor designs and beryllium-coated diaphragms, while retail distribution is handled by global e-commerce audio shops. Representative model pricing for FORCE1 has commonly been seen around 79 USD at launch/retail. [3][6][7][8]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Third-party measurements of multiple TFZ/SuperTFZ models on Reference Audio Analyzer’s SIEC rig show frequency responses with strong low-frequency lift and uneven treble that deviate well beyond a neutral target, indicating audible coloration. These include the TFZ X3 and Series 5S, both demonstrating significant bass emphasis and departures from Harman In-Ear target references on the same rig. While sensitivities are generally high (e.g., 5S listed at 133.3 dB SPL/V, 14.8 Ω), response linearity rather than efficiency is the limiting factor for transparency. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The lineup employs competent, contemporary single dynamic-driver architectures (≈10–11.4 mm) with marketing claims of “dual/‘Tesla’ magnetic” motors and beryllium-coated diaphragms. These are mainstream techniques in 2023–2025 budget IEM design and do not, on their own, secure transparent-level performance without corroborating measurements. Documented model specs from retailers corroborate these constructions but do not evidence unique breakthroughs over peers. [3][8]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equal-or-better)**: *7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2* — a single-dynamic IEM with broadly neutral target adherence and low distortion per independent testing; core functions are equivalent (wired IEM, no ANC/BT). [4]

**Prices used (current market examples):**  
- Review-side representative: *SuperTFZ FORCE1* ≈ **79 USD** (typical retail at launch; still within market norms). [6][7]  
- Comparator: *7Hz Zero:2* **24.99 USD** regular price (Linsoul). [5]

**CP calculation (explicit):** `24.99 ÷ 79 = 0.316… → 0.3`

**Equivalence note:** Zero:2 provides the same user-facing function set (wired IEM) and meets or exceeds key measured performance axes (FR target adherence and low THD) relative to representative SuperTFZ tunings, at a substantially lower price. [1][2][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Products use common, serviceable 0.78 mm 2-pin cables and are sold via established retailers/distributors (e.g., Penon Audio, Linsoul for the TFZ/SuperTFZ family). Long-term reliability data and official, centralized after-sales documentation from the brand are limited in English; warranty handling typically follows retailer policies. No firmware factors apply (purely analog designs). [3][8]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The brand’s emphasis on impactful bass and vivid presentation prioritizes a colored signature over transparent reproduction. Given available third-party measurements showing sizable departures from neutral targets, engineering focus appears tuned for a fun, V-or-W-shaped tonality rather than scientifically transparent playback. Marketing around magnetic-system strength is not matched by objective transparency gains in published measurements. [1][2]

## Advice

If you specifically want a lively, bass-boosted tuning for casual listening, certain SuperTFZ models can satisfy that preference. However, listeners seeking measurement-aligned tonality and overall value should start with *7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2* for neutral-leaning performance at extremely low cost, or step up to deep-insertion references like *Etymotic ER2XR* for high isolation and accuracy-oriented tuning (note: fit differs greatly). [4][5][6]
