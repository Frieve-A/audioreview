## Overview

Merging Technologies is a professional audio manufacturer founded in Switzerland in 1990, which became part of the Sennheiser Group in 2022. The company is known as one of the world's leading manufacturers of high-resolution digital audio recording systems. Their main products include the Anubis, Horus, and Hapi series audio interfaces and Pyramix DAW, actively adopting advanced technologies such as DSD256 support and RAVENNA/AES67 network audio protocols. Widely used in professional studios and broadcast facilities, they boast industry-leading measurement performance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Merging Technologies products achieve industry-leading measurement performance. The Anubis achieves exceptional dynamic range of 136-139dB and THD+N performance below -120dB, significantly exceeding expected levels. The Horus achieves 124dB dynamic range and -130dB crosstalk performance, while the Hapi recorded 126dB dynamic range and THD+N of 0.0002% in Sound on Sound magazine testing. These figures far exceed measurement criteria, achieving completely transparent acoustic reproduction for human hearing. The adoption of 32-bit ADC/DAC makes quantization noise practically negligible.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company actively pursues proprietary technology development, particularly the Anubis's 32-bit dual-path A-D architecture, which represents a unique design not found elsewhere. They were early adopters of cutting-edge network audio protocols including RAVENNA/AES67, NMOS, ST2110, and ST2022-7, contributing to industry standard formation. Support for high-resolution formats like DSD256 and 384kHz operation is also advanced. However, basic AD/DA conversion technology primarily uses third-party DAC chips rather than completely proprietary revolutionary technology. Nevertheless, they maintain technical standards significantly above industry average, with design philosophy that successfully balances reliability and performance required for professional applications.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

With Anubis Pro priced at approximately 2,400 USD and Premium at 2,300 USD, no cheaper alternatives with equivalent functionality and measurement performance exist. As products featuring RAVENNA/AES67 network audio, DSD256 support, and high dynamic range, they are positioned at the world's lowest price level for such capabilities. Other candidates like Neumann MT 48 or Antelope Audio Orion32 are considered, but the former lacks DSD support and thus inferior in functionality, while the latter is more expensive. For applications requiring advanced network functionality and highest-level measurement performance, cost-performance is excellent.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Corporate stability improved following acquisition by Sennheiser Group in 2022. As an established manufacturer with over 30 years of history, they have a proven track record of long-term use in professional studios worldwide. Products feature robust design intended for professional applications, with failure rates presumably below industry average. Firmware updates are regularly provided, with ongoing support for new network protocols. However, repair costs are high due to premium pricing, and the specialized nature of products creates higher barriers compared to general support systems. Nevertheless, they provide reliability and support standards above industry benchmarks.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Merging Technologies' design philosophy is scientifically grounded, with their emphasis on measurable performance improvements being highly commendable. Active adoption of network audio protocols achieves flexibility beyond the limitations of traditional analog connections or AES/EBU digital connections. However, the extremely expensive product lineup provides more performance than necessary for many users. General PC and high-performance interface combinations like RME can often achieve equivalent results, raising questions about the necessity of dedicated audio equipment. Transparency criteria may not require this level in some cases, but technical rationality remains highly evaluable.

## Advice

Merging Technologies products boast world-class measurement performance and reliably deliver expected performance for professional applications. They provide irreplaceable value particularly for building network audio environments or studios frequently performing DSD recording. However, for general music production, products from RME, Universal Audio, MOTU, and others provide practically sufficient performance with significant cost savings. In cases where transparency criteria do not require this level, consider other options. When considering purchase, carefully evaluate whether Merging-level performance is truly necessary. While strongly recommended for professional users with adequate budgets seeking ultimate measurement performance, they offer excellent value. Considering network audio's future potential, there is value as a long-term investment.
