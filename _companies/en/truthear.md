## Overview

TRUTHEAR was founded in 2022 as a high-tech enterprise headquartered in Shenzhen, China, dedicated to the research, development, production, and sales of audio products. The company specializes in creating high-performance in-ear monitors (IEMs) with a focus on providing authentic and accurate audio experiences for music enthusiasts, professional audio workers, and artists. TRUTHEAR operates through partnerships with HeyGears, an established 3D printing company founded in 2015 that provides end-to-end solutions for hearable production including earphones, hearing aids, and hearing protection devices. The company has gained recognition for budget-friendly IEMs with outstanding sound quality, particularly through collaborations with world-renowned reviewer Crinacle on scientific target curve-based tuning.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

TRUTHEAR demonstrates strong scientific validity through measurement-driven approach with independent third-party verification. Company-wide evaluation uses weighted average across representative products: ZERO:RED (weight 0.4), NOVA (weight 0.3), PURE (weight 0.2), and GATE (weight 0.1). ZERO:RED achieved very close match to target frequency response with incredibly low distortion even at 114 dBSPL according to Audio Science Review measurements, earning 0.8 score [1]. NOVA demonstrates THD <1% @1kHz at 94dB with sensitivity of 123dB/Vrms and impedance of 14.8Ω±15%, with independent measurements from Reference Audio Analyzer confirming sensitivity of 128.2 dB SPL and impedance of 17.8 ohm, earning 0.7 score [2][6]. PURE achieves THD below 0.1% at 1kHz/94dB SPL with effective frequency response 20Hz-20kHz (±3dB), earning 0.7 score [7]. GATE shows THD≤1% @1kHz (94dB) with third-party B&K 5128 measurements confirming competent tuning, earning 0.7 score [8]. Weighted average: (0.8×0.4) + (0.7×0.3) + (0.7×0.2) + (0.7×0.1) = 0.74, rounded to 0.7. Products demonstrate close adherence to scientifically-derived target curves including Harman IE 2019 and IEF_Neutral_Target, with BK5128 HATS measurement system validation ensuring accuracy.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

TRUTHEAR demonstrates solid technical competence through in-house design capabilities and modern measurement-based development approaches. Company adopts cutting-edge BK5128 HATS measurement system for scientific tuning validation, representing technology recency in audio measurement standards. Technical expertise evident through successful collaboration with HeyGears for advanced 3D printing manufacturing and partnership with Crinacle for evidence-based tuning methodology. Driver technology incorporates mature internal magnetic circuit structures with flexible polyurethane suspension and LCP liquid crystal composite diaphragms across product line. Multi-driver products like NOVA and PURE feature sophisticated three-way crossover implementations with carefully calculated RC circuits optimizing frequency division and phase consistency. However, technology primarily focuses on analog/mechanical approaches with limited digital integration compared to smartphone-level AI and software processing. Dual dynamic driver configurations and target curve tuning approaches, while effective, represent relatively accessible technology that competitors can replicate without significant competitive advantage duration.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Company-wide cost-performance evaluation using weighted average of representative products across TRUTHEAR's main product lines. Selected products: ZERO:RED (budget-mid, 80% weight) and GATE (ultra-budget, 20% weight) representing core market positioning. NOVA and PURE are excluded from CP evaluation as their cheapest equivalent-or-better alternatives are identified as ZERO:RED from the same manufacturer, which would incorrectly suggest the company provides CP 1.0 products. This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. ZERO:RED at approximately 55 USD provides dual dynamic driver configuration with <1% THD @1kHz, 17.5Ω impedance, and 117.5dB/Vrms sensitivity. Third-party measurements confirm frequency response RMS error of 1-2 dB range with reference-level target curve tracking, channel mismatch around 0.3 dB, and consistency around 0.8 dB [1]. THD remains in 0.1-0.5% range at high SPL levels. Systematic market survey reveals no cheaper products offering equivalent or superior measured performance across frequency response accuracy (RMS error ≤2 dB), distortion characteristics (THD ≤0.5%), and channel matching (mismatch ≤0.5 dB, consistency ≤1.0 dB). ZERO:RED effectively serves as performance benchmark at this price point with no cheaper equal-or-better alternatives identified. CP = 1.0 (no cheaper equal-or-better alternative). GATE at 21.99 USD: Manufacturer specs report THD≤1% @1kHz (94dB) and <0.2% nonlinear distortion at 104dB SPL with effective 20Hz–20kHz band (IEC60318-4, −3dB) [8]. Third-party B&K 5128 measurements show Gate tracks contemporary DF/HRTF targets reasonably well for single-DD budget set [8]. Systematic market survey for products with equivalent-or-better measured performance (single dynamic driver, detachable 0.78mm 2-pin cable, comparable FR to widely used targets) identifies Tangzu Wan'er SG at 19.80 USD as cheapest equivalent option [8]. Tangzu Wan'er SG offers same core user functions and comparable measured FR. CP = 19.80 ÷ 21.99 = 0.900, rounded to 0.9. Weighted average: (1.0×0.8) + (0.900×0.2) = 0.98, rounded to 1.0. TRUTHEAR demonstrates exceptional cost-performance with ZERO:RED achieving benchmark status and GATE providing competitive value against alternatives at lower prices.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

TRUTHEAR maintains standard reliability and support infrastructure appropriate for a company founded in 2022. Products typically include one-year warranty covering manufacturing defects with some retailers extending coverage to two years. Support system operates primarily through dealer-based channels with warranty claims processed through retailers like Shenzhen Audio and Headphone Zone. Official warranty claim process requires completion of request forms with response guaranteed within one day, followed by inspection period up to seven working days. Simple dynamic driver designs in products like GATE reduce potential failure points, though multi-driver configurations in NOVA and PURE introduce additional complexity. Company provides official support page and maintains Discord community for customer assistance. However, limited operational history as new manufacturer prevents assessment of long-term reliability track record. Support infrastructure relies heavily on retail partners rather than direct manufacturer channels, which may affect consistency of service quality across different markets.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

TRUTHEAR demonstrates highly rational design philosophy emphasizing measurement-focused scientific approach over subjective audio preferences. Company's core mission statement of providing "authentic and accurate audio experiences" aligns with evidence-based development methodology using BK5128 HATS measurement system for validation. Target curve-based tuning approach utilizing Harman IE 2019 and IEF_Neutral curves represents scientifically-derived frequency response optimization rather than marketing-driven subjective tuning. Collaboration with measurement-focused reviewer Crinacle indicates commitment to objective rather than opinion-based development decisions. Cost allocation directly contributes to driver quality improvements and scientific tuning accuracy rather than meaningless aesthetic enhancements. Iterative product improvements from ZERO to ZERO:RED demonstrate performance progression based on measured criteria. Partnership with HeyGears for advanced 3D printing manufacturing shows adoption of modern production technologies. However, limited integration of cutting-edge digital signal processing, AI, and software technologies represents missed opportunities for innovation beyond traditional acoustic approaches.

## Advice

For budget-conscious users seeking scientifically-tuned IEMs, TRUTHEAR products deliver excellent measured performance but face intense competition from equally capable alternatives at lower prices. ZERO:RED provides outstanding target curve tracking and low distortion performance, with Audio Science Review measurements confirming incredibly low distortion even at 114 dBSPL. NOVA represents solid choice for users requiring multi-driver configuration with sophisticated crossover implementation, justified when specific tonal preferences align with its Harman-based tuning. Potential purchasers should carefully evaluate cost-performance against alternatives. ZERO:RED offers exceptional value with no cheaper products matching its measured performance across frequency response accuracy, distortion, and channel matching. NOVA, PURE, and GATE face competition from alternatives at lower prices, requiring careful comparison of measured specifications. TRUTHEAR products best suited for users who specifically value the company's scientific tuning approach and collaboration credentials rather than pure cost optimization. Professional users requiring proven target curve adherence for reference applications may justify premium over basic alternatives.
