summary: "A Chinese IEM startup founded in 2022, gaining significant attention with measurement-based precision tuning in products like Crinacle×Zero, Hexa, and Zero:RED. Reportedly founded by ex-Moondrop engineers, the company releases low-cost, high-performance IEMs adhering to Harman target curves. The Zero:RED (USD 55) is rated as the best IEM under USD 100, achieving price-disruptive cost-performance. Despite being a newcomer, it poses a significant threat to established manufacturers."

## Overview

Truthear is an emerging audio manufacturer founded in 2022 in Shenzhen, China. Within just two years of establishment, the company has made a significant impact on the industry. Their primary distinguishing feature is collaboration with renowned IEM reviewer Crinacle and a scientific tuning approach based on Harman target curves.

One of the founders is reportedly an engineer from Moondrop, inheriting the successful pattern of measurement-focused design, anime-based marketing, and aggressive pricing strategies. The company debuted with the Zero, followed by highly-acclaimed releases including Hexa and Zero:RED. The Zero:RED, priced at USD 50, earned recognition as "the best IEM under USD 100," significantly disrupting industry pricing structures.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The company's products demonstrate high scientific validity based on objective measurement data. The Zero:RED shows excellent measured performance with 20Hz-40.5kHz frequency response, THD < 1%, and 117.5dB/Vrms@1kHz sensitivity. The Hexa also delivers solid specifications at 20Hz-40kHz, 20.5Ω impedance, and 120dB/v sensitivity. RTINGS measurements show the Hexa achieving extremely high Timbre and Distortion scores with an overall 4.8/5 rating. Adherence to Harman target curves demonstrates scientifically-grounded design approach.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Technically solid but limited in innovation. The Zero:RED's 10mm+7.8mm dual dynamic driver configuration is uncommon, utilizing polyurethane suspension composite liquid crystal dome diaphragms and N52 rubidium magnets. The Hexa employs a 10mm dynamic + 3BA configuration with PU+LCP composite diaphragms. However, these technologies represent combinations of existing techniques rather than breakthrough innovations like Topping's measurement achievements. While design execution is excellent, proprietary technology development lags behind other manufacturers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Cost-performance is industry-leading. The Zero:RED (USD 55) achieves performance levels unmatched by any other IEM at this price point, resulting in CP = USD 55 ÷ USD 55 = 1.0. The Hexa (under USD 100) delivers frequency response similar to the Moondrop Blessing 2 (USD 319.99) at less than one-third the price. The balance of measured performance, sound quality evaluation, and pricing represents one of the best values currently available. In the sub-USD 55 IEM market, it significantly outperforms traditional competitors like KZ/CCA.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

As a startup, long-term reliability track record is limited. Initial product quality appears good with few failure reports in user reviews, but two years of company history provides insufficient data for long-term durability assessment. While international distribution networks are established, concerns remain about long-term repair service and parts availability continuity. However, product design quality and component selection appear appropriate, ensuring near-term reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Design philosophy is rational but lacks originality. Harman target curve adherence, measurement-focused tuning, and cost-performance prioritized pricing are all scientifically grounded. Collaboration with Crinacle enables product development verified through both subjective evaluation and objective measurement. However, these approaches closely follow methods already established by companies like Moondrop, with limited evidence of unique design philosophy or technical vision.

## Advice

Truthear represents one of the most noteworthy emerging audio manufacturers today. For those prioritizing cost-performance, the company's products offer optimal choices.

**Strongly Recommended for**:
- Those seeking maximum performance within USD 55-100 budgets
- Users prioritizing objective sound quality based on measurement data
- Those willing to accept startup company risks

**Considerations**:
- Limited long-term support guarantees due to short company history
- Technical innovation may lag behind other manufacturers
- Product lineup limited to IEMs

Current offerings provide performance significantly exceeding other manufacturers in their price ranges, with the Zero:RED and Hexa earning recognition as price-disruptive products. However, consider startup-specific risks when making purchase decisions. For cost-performance prioritization, these represent currently the most compelling options available.
