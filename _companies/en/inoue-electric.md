## Overview

Inoue Electric was a Japanese audio manufacturer that primarily produced single-cone speaker systems from the 1960s to 1970s. Their representative product, the KI speaker, featured a 16cm full-range unit and is now highly valued in the vintage audio market. Additionally, Icom Inc. continues to manufacture audio equipment such as the external speaker SP-23, which is used in combination with amateur radio equipment. Discontinued Inoue Electric products are traded in the second-hand market at price ranges from 12,500 JPY to 60,500 JPY due to their rarity.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Inoue Electric's KI speakers utilize 1960s single-cone design, which has limitations by modern measurement standards. The 16cm full-range unit is constrained in low and high frequency reproduction capabilities. The Icom SP-23 fulfills basic external speaker functions but is not designed for Hi-Fi applications, prioritizing voice clarity for amateur radio use.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

While Inoue Electric's single-cone technology was standard for the 1960s, it has become obsolete by modern standards. Full-range single-driver acoustic reproduction has physical limitations and offers no technical advantages compared to contemporary 2-way or 3-way speaker designs. No proprietary technologies are confirmed through patents or technical papers, remaining within the scope of general manufacturing techniques of that era. The Icom SP-23 employs standard external speaker design combining off-the-shelf electroacoustic components, containing no innovative technical elements.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comparing vintage Inoue Electric products' used market price of 39,921 JPY against modern products with equivalent acoustic performance such as the Sony SS-CS5 (approximately 15,000 JPY), the calculation yields 15,000 JPY รท 39,921 JPY = 0.38. However, excluding vintage value and evaluating pure acoustic performance, modern products in the same price range are clearly superior. The Icom SP-23 (18,000 JPY excluding tax) shows low cost-performance of 5,000 JPY รท 19,800 JPY = 0.25, as generic external speakers with equivalent functionality are available for approximately 5,000 JPY.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Inoue Electric products have no official support due to production discontinuation, with repairs possible through specialist services offering 16cm full-range unit overhauls ranging from 34,000 JPY to 37,400 JPY. Challenges include difficulty in parts procurement and high repair costs. Conversely, the Icom SP-23 is a current product with official support provided, including downloadable instruction manual services. However, Icom products also remain within industry-average warranty periods and support systems.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Inoue Electric's 1960s single-cone design was a rational approach under the technological constraints of that time, but faces physical limitations compared to modern multi-way designs. Full-range single-driver reproduction for full-band audio is disadvantageous against modern designs using dedicated drivers optimized for each frequency band. The Icom SP-23, as a specialized design, is rational for its clear purpose of ensuring voice clarity in amateur radio applications, but is not optimized for Hi-Fi reproduction. Both companies show no utilization of modern digital signal processing technologies.

## Advice

For those who value vintage audio hobbyist appeal, Inoue Electric's KI speakers are historically valuable options. However, for pure sound quality improvement, we recommend selecting modern-designed speakers such as the Sony SS-CS5 or ELAC Debut 2.0 B5.2 at the same price point. The Icom SP-23 should be considered exclusively for amateur radio applications, while dedicated-design products at the same price are appropriate for Hi-Fi use. For all products, prior audition confirmation is important due to limited published measurement data.
