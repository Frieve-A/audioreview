## Overview

Singxer (Guangzhou Singxer Electronics Co., Ltd.) is a Chinese audio company founded in 2011 in Panyu District, Guangzhou. It focuses on high-performance digital audio, both as an ODM/OEM and under its own brand. Core strengths are XMOS USB implementations, clocking/PLL design, and practical digital interface engineering. Product lines center on DACs, USB digital interfaces (DDCs), and balanced headphone amplifiers for technically minded users.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Measured performance is generally excellent and often at or near transparent levels for playback electronics.  
- **SA-1 amp**: manufacturer-specified SNR **147 dB** and THD+N **-120 dB** (A-wt, 1 kHz). Output power reaches 5.5 W @32 ohms (balanced). These figures comfortably exceed transparency thresholds for electronics [1].  
- **SU-6 DDC**: independently measured by GoldenSound as **the highest-performing DDC he had tested**, with RMS jitter **~75 ps** and peak jitter **~224 ps**, and noise floor around **-148.9 dBFS** [2].  
- **SDA-6 PRO/PRO2 DACs**: feature galvanically isolated USB, multi-oscillator clocking, and dual-AKM 4499EX (PRO2). Official specs and credible reviews indicate state-of-the-art implementation, though comprehensive third-party lab measurements for the latest PRO2 remain limited [4][5].

Caveat: While DDCs like SU-6 can measurably reduce interface jitter/noise, the **audible** benefit with modern, well-implemented DACs is often small. We balance strong numbers with real-world audibility to keep this criterion at **0.8**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Singxer invests in advanced, sensible engineering: temperature-stabilized local clocks, **Crystek CCHD-957** femtosecond oscillators (SU-6 uses two), FPGA/CPLD-based FIFO/re-clock pipelines, and supercapacitor audio rails (**7.5 F** on SU-6) [3]. The **SDA-6 PRO2** adds dual AK4499EX with a **4-way independent low-jitter crystal architecture** and supports **10 MHz external clock** on USB-features common in high-end pro-audio brought to consumer gear [4]. The **SDA-6 PRO** uses **galvanically isolated** USB, a hallmark of thoughtful digital design [5]. Not every implementation is peerless, but overall sophistication is high and focused on measurable outcomes.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

For a **company-level** CP score, we averaged representative current products using the formula **"cheapest equivalent-or-better price / review-target price"** (clamped at 1.0). **"Equivalent-or-better"** was judged strictly by user-facing functions and measured performance.

1) **SA-1 (USD 599)** - Comparator: **Topping A70 Pro (USD 499)**.  
   *Why equivalent-or-better?* Both are fully balanced desktop headphone amps. A70 Pro publishes **THD+N < 0.00005%** (~-126 dB) and **SNR/DNR 147 dB**, matching or bettering SA-1's distortion claims while undercutting price [6][7].  
   **CP = 499 / 599 = 0.83 ~ 0.8**

2) **SU-6 (USD 750)** - No cheaper DDC found that is functionally equivalent **and** measures as good or better.  
   - **Gustard U18 (USD 499)** measures worse than SU-6 on key jitter metrics per GoldenSound; not eligible as **"equal-or-better"** [8].  
   **CP = 1.0**

3) **SDA-6 PRO2 (USD 1,299)** - Comparator: **SMSL DO300 (USD 549)**.  
   *Why equivalent?* Balanced XLR outputs and **I2S** input, very low THD+N and **~147 dB**-class DNR in independent testing/official materials; functionally comparable modern DAC with excellent measurements at a much lower price [9][10][11].  
   **CP = 549 / 1,299 = 0.42 ~ 0.4**

**Company CP = average(0.8, 1.0, 0.4) = 0.73 ~ 0.7.**

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Hardware quality is solid; long-term reliability appears typical for this category. Support is **retailer-dependent**: major distributors (e.g., ShenzhenAudio) advertise **30-day returns** and a **two-year warranty** on many units, but after-sales responsiveness varies by seller and region [1][4]. Firmware/resources are available but not centralized on a manufacturer portal. Net result: acceptable but not standout.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Design choices concentrate on **measurable** problem areas (USB isolation, power-rail cleanliness, clock stability, re-clocking). Marketing focuses on engineering details with concrete implications for jitter/noise rather than vague **"voicing."** Where claims are strong (e.g., DDC benefits), the company provides technical underpinnings; we temper expectations about **audibility** accordingly.

## Advice

- If you **need a USB-DDC**, SU-6 remains a top performer with deep I/O (AES/EBU, BNC/RCA S/PDIF, **RJ45/HDMI-I2S**, word/master clock), **temperature-stabilized** clocks and **supercapacitor** rails [3].  
- For a **balanced amp** with maximal objective performance per dollar, **Topping A70 Pro** is the value leader at this tier. If you prefer Singxer's discrete topology/features, **SA-1** is still a capable choice [1][6][7].  
- For a **modern DAC** with I2S and strong measurements at lower cost, the **SMSL DO300** undercuts SDA-6 PRO2 while meeting most users' needs [9][10][11]. Choose Singxer if you specifically want its USB isolation/clock ecosystem and feature set.  
- **About external/high-accuracy clocks:** clock precision **does not improve sound quality** when used for anything other than the required **device synchronization**. Use external 10 MHz word/master clocks only when your system actually needs common-clock sync; otherwise don't expect audible gains.
