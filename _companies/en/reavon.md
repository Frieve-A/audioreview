## Overview

Reavon is a French brand associated with Groupe Archisoft (the company behind Zappiti). It launched in 2021 to fill the high-end universal disc-player gap left by Oppo and offered three models: UBR-X100, UBR-X110 and flagship UBR-X200. In mid-August 2025, multiple reports confirmed Reavon has **ceased production** of its UHD Blu-ray players due to parts shortages, with no replacement models planned at this time [9]. The information below reflects that status while evaluating product value and user impact as of the review date.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

For the UBR-X200, Reavon specifies Burr-Brown PCM1795 (stereo) and PCM1690 (7.1ch) DACs with published figures of up to 123 dB dynamic range and 0.0005% THD+N for the stereo path (manufacturer specs) [1]. Disc compatibility spans UHD BD, BD/BD3D, DVD, **DVD-Audio**, **SACD**, and CD; digital file support includes PCM/DSD via USB/DLNA [1]. Independent, lab-grade measurements of complete devices remain scarce; therefore, our assessment leans on catalog specifications (clearly labeled) and widely reported format support from official pages and major retailers [1][2]. Given the category (largely digital transport over HDMI), claims of audible superiority beyond verified measurements should be treated cautiously.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Reavon’s platform centers on MediaTek’s MTK8581 UHD Blu-ray SoC with a robust mechanical chassis, dual HDMI (separate audio output), toroidal power transformer, and optional 7.1ch analog outputs on the X200 [1]. These are competent, mainstream engineering choices rather than distinctive proprietary innovations. HDR support on current models covers HDR10 and Dolby Vision; **HDR10+ is not supported** [1][7]. Overall, execution is solid but technologically conventional.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

**Method (company review):** we average CP across representative current/last-shipping models (X100, X110, X200) with **equal weights** due to lack of reliable sales share data (policy-compliant company evaluation). Prices reflect stable US market/MSRP evidence as of August 2025.

- **UBR-X100 (899 USD)** vs **Sony UBP-X800M2 (329.99 USD Best Buy)** → CP ≈ 329.99/899 = **0.37**.  
  *Equivalence note:* X800M2 plays UHD BD, BD, DVD, **SACD**, **DVD-Audio**, with dual HDMI and wide file support; user-facing functions and format coverage meet or exceed X100 (which lacks SACD) [1][2][3].  
- **UBR-X110 (999 USD)** vs **Sony UBP-X800M2 (329.99 USD)** → CP ≈ 329.99/999 = **0.33**.  
  *Equivalence note:* Both support UHD BD, BD, DVD, **SACD**, **DVD-Audio** and dual HDMI; measured performance parity is assumed provisionally due to limited public lab data (manufacturer/official specs and major-retailer listings cited) [2][3].  
- **UBR-X200 (assessed at 1,999 USD current retail)** vs **Magnetar UDP900 (2,999 USD)** → CP = **1.0** (clamped; no cheaper equal-or-better).  
  *Equivalence note:* UDP900 offers UHD BD, BD, DVD, **SACD**, **DVD-Audio**, plus **7.1ch analog RCA** (like X200) and balanced stereo; it is equal-or-better on user functions and I/O, and is the **cheapest** such alternative with 7.1 analog currently available—yet it is more expensive than the X200 [1][4][10].

**Company CP (equal-weight average):** (0.37 + 0.33 + 1.0) / 3 = **0.57 → 0.6** (rounded to one decimal).

**Price bases:** X100 899 USD / X110 999 USD / X200 1,999 USD (current listing), X800M2 329.99 USD (Best Buy), UDP900 2,999 USD (Value Electronics) [3][5][6][10][13].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

On **August 15, 2025** What Hi-Fi reported Reavon has **ceased production** owing to component shortages, with **no replacement models planned** [9]. While the official site and support pages remain online (firmware last updated Dec 2023 for X200) [1][11], future parts supply and long-term repair prospects are uncertain. We therefore lower the score to reflect heightened support risk post-production-stop.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Prioritizing broad disc/file compatibility, dual-HDMI isolation, and a stiff chassis is rational in a universal-player context. However, absence of HDR10+ and the premium pricing over functionally equivalent HDMI-only competitors reduce the overall rationality from a value standpoint [1][7][3].

## Advice

If you require **SACD/DVD-Audio** and will use **HDMI** to an AVR/processor, **Sony UBP-X800M2** delivers similar user-visible functionality at a much lower price [2][3]. If you specifically need **7.1 analog outputs** and universal disc support, **Magnetar UDP900** remains the viable current option—albeit at a much higher price [4][10]. Given Reavon’s production halt, availability may be limited; weigh support considerations accordingly [9][11].
