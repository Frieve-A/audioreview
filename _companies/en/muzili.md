## Overview

Muzili is a China-based low-cost audio equipment manufacturer, primarily producing Bluetooth earbuds and speakers. The company entered the global market around 2018, mainly through online sales platforms like Amazon, attracting consumer attention with extremely affordable pricing. Representative products include TWS i7, ET2, and T22 wireless earbuds, sold in the price range of a few thousand yen or less. While maintaining an official website (muzilitec.com) and promoting "Your smart life and melody carrier," details about their investment in technological development and quality control systems remain unclear.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Muzili products provide only basic audio functions and cannot be expected to deliver any scientifically meaningful sound quality improvements. No detailed measurement data such as frequency response, THD (Total Harmonic Distortion), or S/N ratio are published for the company's products, and no objective measurement data from reliable third-party institutions exist. User reviews mentioning "not overly bass-emphasized" suggest performance far from the transparent level of the measurement standards table (20Hz-20kHz Â±0.5dB). Although some models claim Bluetooth 5.0 support and noise cancellation, their effectiveness and measurement performance are unknown and incomparable to products with established technologies. Even considering the price, auditorily transparent level sound quality improvement is not achieved.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Muzili's technology level is significantly below the industry average. The company's products are primarily designed using combinations of off-the-shelf chipsets, with no confirmed proprietary acoustic technology development or patented technologies. While implementing existing technologies like Bluetooth 5.0, these are industry standards and do not demonstrate any technological originality or superiority. Battery capacity and playback time are also mediocre, and there is no evidence of investment in advanced driver design or DSP processing technology for sound quality improvement, especially in acoustic design. The negative evaluations of product quality also indicate that technological investment is insufficient.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Muzili's cost-performance receives the highest possible rating of 1.0 due to its extreme low-price strategy. Considering the basic functions provided by its representative products (such as the TWS i7), including Bluetooth 5.0 and TWS capabilities, it is virtually impossible to find products with equivalent or superior functions at a lower price.

According to the review policy, if a reviewed product is the cheapest in its class for a comparable set of features, its cost-performance is rated 1.0. Muzili's products precisely fit this case. Although their absolute performance is low, they excel in one specific area: providing a particular set of features at the lowest price on the market, thus maximizing their cost-performance score.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Muzili's reliability and support system is at the industry's lowest level. Although the company provides regional support contacts, there is a lot of negative information about the actual quality of support and handling of failures. Details on warranty periods and repair systems are unclear, and substantial after-sales service, especially in markets like Japan, cannot be expected. The durability of the products is not suitable for long-term use, and continuous support such as firmware updates is not provided. While initial defects may be exchanged through major online retail channels, the manufacturer's reliability is extremely low.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Muzili's design philosophy completely lacks a scientific approach to sound quality improvement and is evaluated as highly irrational. The "cost-first" design philosophy ignores improvements in measurement performance and technical sophistication. It relies on cheap combinations of existing technologies and has no compelling reason to exist as a dedicated audio device. There is no clear advantage even when compared to smartphone-bundled accessories in the same price range. The product development, which prioritizes marketing over sound quality, is irrational for an audio equipment manufacturer.

## Advice

Muzili is not recommended for users who prioritize absolute performance, quality, or support. However, it may be considered for the very specific need of acquiring certain functionalities at the lowest possible cost. For example, if you need wireless earbuds that you can use without any concern for loss or damage.

The company's products offer the basic features of TWS earbuds at the most competitive price point in the market. In this single aspect, no other brand can compete. However, this is achieved by sacrificing many other elements, including sound quality, reliability, and support. When considering a purchase, it is essential to fully understand these trade-offs and be prepared to accept that you are getting only the bare minimum functionality. If you seek even slightly better sound quality or reliability, it is strongly recommended to increase your budget slightly and consider other brands such as QCY or SoundPEATS.
