## Overview

Inoue Denki was a Japanese audio manufacturer led by Kenzo Inoue, known for the KI 16 cm full-range speakers and dedicated tube amplifiers. It is unrelated to Icom (Inoue Electronic), the radio maker founded by Tokuzo Inoue [7]. Vintage KI units appear in auctions and repair case reports today [4][5].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

No credible third-party measurements of KI speakers or Inoue Denki amplifiers were found. Single-cone 16 cm designs generally limit bandwidth and output capability relative to modern multi-way speakers. In the absence of verified data, claims remain unconfirmed; this score reflects the lack of published measurements rather than subjective impressions [5].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The brand developed in-house loudspeakers and tube amplifiers in the 1960s/70s. A patent by Kenzo Inoue indicates original driver work (plated resin diaphragm), showing some R&D but aligned with mainstream technologies of the era rather than contemporary DSP/material advances [6].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Cheapest equal-or-better product (user-visible functions and measured performance): **Sony SS-CS5 (pair)**. It is a modern 3-way bookshelf speaker with independent third-party measurements available and normal retail pricing widely tracked [2][3].  
**CP calculation (USD)** — using a typical KI pair market price from a recent completed auction as the denominator:  
**USD 199.99 ÷ USD 614 ≈ 0.33** → **0.3** after rounding [3][4].  
*Equivalence note:* SS-CS5 provides full-range stereo playback with measured on-axis/in-room response and distortion performance that are at least on par with vintage single-cone designs, and generally superior above 10 kHz and below 100 Hz per modern tests [2].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

No manufacturer support exists; products are decades out of production. Maintenance relies on third-party specialists; example: a professional shop reports KI 16 cm driver service/edge replacement and showcases typical age-related issues [5]. Unit condition varies widely for auctioned items [4].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Persisting with single-cone and vacuum-tube approaches prioritizes historical design over measurable transparency. Absent evidence of audible, measurement-verified benefits versus modern multi-way/solid-state systems, the direction is conservative rather than measurement-driven.

## Advice

Collectors of Japanese vintage audio or those restoring historical systems may find Inoue Denki appealing as a period piece. For transparent, measurement-first listening at low budget, modern measured designs like Sony SS-CS5 (or similar) offer better predictable performance, availability, and support [2][3].
