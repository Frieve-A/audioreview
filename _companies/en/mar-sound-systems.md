## Overview

MAR SOUND is an innovative acoustic technology company developed by Italy's Mar-System. The company possesses unique technology that uses piezoelectric actuators (20X20X1mm) to convert structural surfaces such as wood, cement, metal, marble, and glass into active acoustic radiators. A single Bluetooth-integrated amplifier can drive up to 30 actuators, enabling existing structures like walls and furniture to become invisible speaker systems. While proposing groundbreaking approaches for architectural acoustics and specialized applications, the technology has fundamentally different characteristics from conventional audio reproduction.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Piezoelectric speaker technology is a scientifically valid acoustic conversion method, but has constraints for high-fidelity audio reproduction. Research indicates that piezoelectric speakers generally operate well around resonant frequencies of 2-4kHz and show optimal performance in the 1-5kHz range, but have narrow bandwidth (several kHz) and non-flat frequency characteristics particularly in low frequencies. THD is also higher compared to conventional technology, with standard piezoelectric speakers reporting below 5% and MEMS technology showing 3-15%. MAR SOUND has not published specific measurement data, and the method of vibrating structures creates differences from the precise acoustic control of conventional speakers. From an acoustic engineering perspective, this technology is specialized for realizing acoustic effects in specific applications rather than faithful music reproduction across the entire audible spectrum.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Surface acoustic conversion technology using piezoelectric materials is an advanced field requiring sophisticated knowledge of materials science and acoustic engineering. The technology to convert entire structures into acoustic radiators using compact 20X20X1mm actuators shows originality and realizes a completely different approach from conventional electromagnetic speakers. The Bluetooth-integrated amplifier system controlling up to 30 channels also demonstrates technical complexity. However, this technology emphasizes installation convenience and visual considerations over audio quality improvement and does not directly contribute to the measurement performance improvements required in the audio field. While the technology itself is commendable, its value remains limited from a high-fidelity acoustic reproduction perspective.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Accurate cost-performance evaluation of MAR SOUND systems is difficult due to undisclosed specific pricing. As equivalent surface acoustic technology, UK-based Feonic Technology's vibration speaker technology exists as a competing product, also adopting a similar approach to convert walls and windows into acoustic radiation surfaces. In terms of pure audio quality, general-purpose Bluetooth speakers provide superior performance in frequency characteristics and distortion characteristics. For example, the Anker Soundcore 2 (41 USD) achieves wide-band reproduction of 20Hz-20kHz and low distortion characteristics of THD+N below 0.5%, providing higher fidelity than MAR SOUND for general music listening purposes. Due to undisclosed pricing, specific CP calculation cannot be performed, but considering the technology is limited to specialized applications, cost-performance for general music reproduction use is limited.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

While Mar-System operates as an Italian company, detailed information about global support systems and warranty systems is limited. Piezoelectric elements are generally long-life and highly reliable devices, but in the specialized application of architectural installation, concerns exist regarding installation precision and performance degradation due to aging. Due to the highly specialized nature of the technology, installation and maintenance likely require specialized knowledge, and support like that of general audio equipment cannot be expected. Being an emerging technology field, there are unclear aspects regarding long-term product support and continuity of parts supply, limiting evaluation to industry average standards.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

MAR SOUND's design philosophy is based on the concept of "invisible speakers" and is innovative from architectural acoustics and spatial design perspectives. However, it deviates from the scientific goal of high-fidelity audio reproduction. The audio quality constraints of piezoelectric technology are known, and it is clear that it is inferior to conventional technology in achieving flat frequency characteristics and low distortion characteristics. Design decisions that prioritize installation convenience over music reproduction transparency differ in direction from pure audio quality pursuit. While meaningful as specialized applications or architecturally integrated acoustic systems, it cannot be considered a rational approach aimed at scientifically measurable audio quality improvement. The design philosophy emphasizes visual and spatial considerations over basic performance improvement as audio equipment.

## Advice

MAR SOUND is a specialized application product that emphasizes installation flexibility over music reproduction quality. It is suitable for adoption in commercial spaces such as museums, art galleries, and high-end retail stores where the visual presence of conventional speakers needs to be eliminated. It is not recommended for general music listening or audio system construction purposes. Choosing conventional speaker systems with equivalent investment would provide far superior audio quality. When considering purchase, clear purpose consciousness that prioritizes spatial design and architectural integration over audio quality is necessary. Additionally, installation requires specialized knowledge, making DIY introduction difficult. Unless for technical interest or experimental purposes, this product is judged unsuitable for general consumers.
