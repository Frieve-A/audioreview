## Overview

MAR SOUND SYSTEMS is an Italian startup company that develops the MAR.sound system, which uses piezoelectric actuator technology to transform structures such as wood, cement, metal, marble, and glass into active speakers. They provide a Bluetooth-integrated amplifier capable of driving up to 30 piezoelectric patches of 20x20x1mm size, targeting office and residential applications for music reproduction, announcements, and conferencing purposes.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Piezoelectric speaker technology operates within a narrow bandwidth of approximately 1-5kHz and cannot achieve the uniform frequency characteristics of 20Hz-20kHz required for music reproduction. The frequency response in the low and mid ranges is particularly poor, making this technology suitable for applications where volume and high-frequency reproduction are prioritized over sound quality. From the perspective of faithful music reproduction across the entire audible range, MAR SOUND's piezoelectric technology has low scientific validity due to fundamental physical constraints.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The engineering aspects demonstrate a certain level of technical competence, including miniaturization of piezoelectric actuators (20x20x1mm), integrated control of up to 30 elements, and Bluetooth integration systems. However, as acoustic technology, it remains at the level of basic piezoelectric effect application, with no innovative approaches to solve the fundamental frequency characteristic problems for music reproduction applications. This is judged to be industry-average level technical implementation.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

MAR SOUND's specific pricing is not publicly disclosed, preventing accurate cost-performance evaluation. For reference, the Dayton Audio DAEX32EP-4 (40W, 4Î©), which provides equivalent functionality, is available for approximately 24 USD. This surface exciter offers superior frequency response and sound quality compared to MAR SOUND, achieving wide bandwidth response. Due to the lack of pricing information, this is evaluated as the industry average of 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

As an emerging company, long-term reliability track record and detailed warranty systems are unknown. The support system from the Italian headquarters is presumed to be limited, and global service deployment cannot be confirmed. While piezoelectric elements themselves are relatively robust, the company's reliability and support system is judged to be below industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

There are problems with the rationality of the design philosophy in adopting piezoelectric technology, which is unsuitable for music reproduction, while positioning music reproduction as a primary application. Piezoelectric speakers are used in applications where volume and high frequencies are prioritized over sound quality, and MAR SOUND's approach of targeting music, announcements, and conferencing lacks scientific basis. Given the existence of more affordable and superior sound quality conventional speakers and DML exciters, there is no recognized rationale for high-priced sales as dedicated audio equipment.

## Advice

MAR SOUND SYSTEMS' piezoelectric surface speaker technology cannot be recommended for music reproduction applications due to fundamental technical constraints. The technology may be suitable for limited applications such as emergency alerts or simple audio notifications, but should be avoided for music listening or conference systems. For applications prioritizing sound quality, conventional surface exciters like the Dayton Audio DAEX32EP-4 at around 24 USD provide superior performance. If considering investment in MAR SOUND, decisions should be made with full understanding of the technology's physical limitations and restricted applications.
