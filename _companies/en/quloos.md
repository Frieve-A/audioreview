summary: "Chinese DAC/amplifier manufacturer offering portable and desktop audio devices with CS43131/CS43198 DAC chips; strong spec claims on MUB1 incl. 1.1 W @32Ω and S/PDIF digital out, but limited third-party measurements"

## Overview

Quloos (formerly QLS HiFi) is a Chinese audio manufacturer in Shenzhen focused on portable and desktop DAC/amps. Key products include the MUB1 Bluetooth portable DAC/amp (quad CS43131) with high power output and a rare 3.5 mm S/PDIF digital out, the MC01 USB dongle, and the QA662 desktop unit. Products span roughly 240–1,000+ USD.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

MUB1 claims THD+N of **0.0001%**, SINAD **120 dB**, SNR/Dynamic Range **132 dB** (A-w), and up to **1,100 mW @32Ω** from its 4.4 mm balanced output, which, if independently verified, would be transparent. However, **no recognized third-party lab reports** (e.g., ASR) are available for Quloos units at the time of writing; numbers rely on manufacturer/retailer specs. Given strong—but not independently verified—figures, we score 0.6.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Quloos uses current Cirrus Logic DACs (CS43131/CS43198), multi-rail LDO power, and conventional analog filtering. MUB1 adds an uncommon **3.5 mm S/PDIF digital output** alongside 3.5 mm SE and 4.4 mm balanced outs. Implementation appears competent but not notably innovative beyond standard engineering practice.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Equivalence check (strict, user-facing functions + measured performance):**

- Review target key functions: **battery portable**, **USB DAC**, **Bluetooth (LDAC/aptX family)**, **4.4 mm balanced & 3.5 mm SE headphone outs**, **~1.1 W @32Ω output power**, **3.5 mm S/PDIF digital output**. Claimed fidelity: **THD+N 0.0001% / SINAD 120 dB / SNR 132 dB** (mfr specs). [1][2]
- Cheapest near-candidates:
  - **xDuoo XD05 Bal (USD 429)**: battery, BT (incl. LDAC), 4.4 mm, ~**1.0 W @32Ω**; **no S/PDIF out** (only S/PDIF in). Adding **HiBy UC10 (USD 29)** provides portable USB-to-coax **S/PDIF out**. However, XD05 Bal’s key fidelity specs are **THD+N 0.0009% / SNR ≥117 dB** (mfr), which are **inferior** to MUB1’s claimed 0.0001% / 132 dB—well outside a ±5% window—so it **fails “equal-or-better” measured performance.** [3][4]
  - **iFi xDSD Gryphon (USD 599)**: battery, BT (LDAC), 4.4 mm, ~**1.0 W @32Ω** and strong measurements, but **price is higher** than MUB1 and it still **lacks S/PDIF out** (S/PDIF is input). Not a cheaper equivalent. [5]

**Conclusion:** As of this review date, **no cheaper product or minimum accessory bundle achieves both “no-less functionality” and “no-less measured performance”** than MUB1. Per policy, **when no cheaper equivalent exists, CP is set to 1.0** and explicitly stated so in the body.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

One-year warranty via established retailers (e.g., Linsoul/HiFiGo). CNC aluminum builds and mainstream DAC chips suggest reasonable reliability. Limited long-term field data and dealer-centric support structure cap the score.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Design choices favor proven architectures and practical features (notably S/PDIF out on a portable). Marketing avoids pseudo-science. Innovation appears incremental rather than unique; stronger third-party validation would help.

## Advice

If you specifically need **a portable DAC/amp with both high output power and S/PDIF digital output**, MUB1 is currently a rare all-in-one. Cheaper units like **Qudelix 5K** remain excellent value for everyday portable BT DAC/amp use, but they **lack S/PDIF out and much lower max power**, so they are not “equivalent-or-better” to MUB1. If you don’t need S/PDIF out and drive easy-to-moderate headphones, those cheaper options may still be preferable on value alone.
