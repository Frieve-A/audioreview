summary: "Diretta develops a LAN audio protocol and host/target implementations (e.g., Lucia) that aim to keep the receiver’s processing load constant. It appears in commercial gear such as SPEC’s RMP-UB1. However, there is still no robust third-party evidence of audible improvement. Against the cheapest equivalent USB network bridges (e.g., iFi ZEN Stream at 399 USD), cost-performance is weak, and setup requires basic networking knowledge. The design is coherent and technically original."

## Overview

Diretta provides an audio protocol over LAN that splits roles into **host** (sender) and **target** (receiver) and **aims to stabilize receiver load** to improve sound quality.[1][2] Commercial adoption includes SPEC’s **RMP-UB1 / RMP-UB1SFP** USB bridge, whose literature claims improvements in **dynamic S/N** during USB-DAC playback.[1] The ecosystem targets the high-end market and competes most directly with finished **USB-output network bridges**.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

We found **no independent blind tests or comprehensive third-party measurements** demonstrating audible benefits from Diretta at this time.[1][2] Meanwhile, many modern DACs measure **transparently** (e.g., Cambridge DacMagic 200M: **SNR 125.2 dB**, **THD+N 0.00016%**),[9] implying that with **bit-perfect** digital delivery, upstream protocol changes are unlikely to be audible. Because Diretta’s **“dynamic S/N”** notion is presented but **not standardized or independently reproduced**,[1] we score **below the 0.5 default** at **0.3**.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Diretta’s **receiver-load leveling** concept, separated **host/target** architecture, and **Lucia** family indicate **original engineering** with a coherent goal, and there are genuine adoptions (e.g., SPEC RMP-UB1).[1][2] However, broader **standardization and external validation** remain limited; thus **0.7**.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

**Comparator (cheapest equivalent-or-better):** **iFi ZEN Stream** — finished USB-audio network bridge with mainstream protocol support.[4][5]  
**Review target basis:** Represented by a widely available Diretta-based finished product, **SPEC RMP-UB1** at **2,599.95 USD** in the U.S. market.[3]  
**Equivalence note:** Both deliver **USB digital output to an external DAC** with mainstream streaming/network features. With bit-perfect output and no verified audible superiority for Diretta, **performance for listeners is equivalent**.[1][4][5]

**Calculation (must display):**  
`399 USD ÷ 2,599.95 USD = 0.153` → rounds to **0.2**.  

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Diretta maintains **official help/updates** (e.g., Lucia update info)[2] and is used in shipping products,[1] but **setup requires basic networking knowledge**[1] and there are **no broad reliability stats** (RMA/MTBF) available. Overall **average** at **0.5**.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The **technical hypothesis** (reducing receiver-side processing variation) is **coherent** and avoids occult claims.[1] Yet, without **standardized third-party measurements or ABX evidence** of audible gains, claimed benefits remain **unproven**. We credit the rational direction but deduct for limited verification: **0.7**.

## Advice

Start with a **low-cost finished USB bridge** to validate usability and stability in your system (e.g., **iFi ZEN Stream, 399 USD**).[4][5] If S/PDIF outputs suffice, the **Cambridge MXN10 (499 USD)** is fully featured and widely supported.[6] For USB-centric use with richer control options, **Pro-Ject Stream Box S2 Ultra (899 USD)** is another choice.[7][8] If you proceed with a Diretta-based device, plan your **network topology**, confirm **service compatibility** (Roon/DSD), and prepare a **level-matched comparison** routine.[1]
