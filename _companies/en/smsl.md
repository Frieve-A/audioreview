summary: "A leader in 'Chi-Fi.' Through skillful circuit techniques implementing the latest high-performance DAC chips, they achieve world-class measured performance at price-breaking costs. Their products are becoming reference standards for audiophiles who prioritize objective data. However, behind their overwhelming price-performance ratio, concerns about firmware stability and long-term support structure have been reported. A brand requiring the resolve to master a double-edged sword."

## Overview

SMSL (S.M.S.L / Foshan Shuangmusanlin Technology Co., Ltd) is an audio equipment manufacturer established in 2009, based in Shenzhen, China. Alongside Topping, they are a representative brand leading the so-called "Chi-Fi" movement, providing high-performance DACs, headphone amplifiers, and power amplifiers at astonishingly low prices. Their products consistently receive top-class evaluations in measurement data-focused communities like Audio Science Review, earning tremendous support from modern audiophiles who pursue pure performance regardless of price.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

SMSL's product development is completely based on scientific and engineering approaches. The company's goal is to improve objective measurements like THD+N (Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise) and SINAD (Signal-to-Noise-and-Distortion) to levels reaching the limits of the latest measuring equipment. There is no room for unscientific thinking or occult elements in their designs, and all claims can be verified through third-party measurement data. This thorough data supremacism deserves a perfect score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

SMSL's technology level receives very high evaluation for maximizing existing high-performance components. They adopt cutting-edge DAC chips from companies like ESS, AKM, and ROHM, successfully extracting performance approaching or exceeding chip catalog specifications through skillful power supply design and circuit layout techniques. This demonstrates advanced implementation technology impossible to achieve through mere component combination. However, they haven't reached the level of developing DAC architectures in-house like dCS or MSB, resulting in a score of 0.8.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Cost-performance is where SMSL shines brightest, earning an undisputed perfect score of 1.0. For example, the company's DAC products (e.g., SMSL DO100, approximately USD 189) boast measured performance matching or exceeding high-end products costing dozens of times more. SMSL products are "the world's cheapest products with equivalent functionality and performance," becoming the standard for cost-performance evaluation. The fact that they achieve this performance at this price overturns conventional audio market pricing wisdom.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While receiving high evaluation, several concerns about reliability and support have been reported. Particularly, firmware bugs (such as large pop noise issues when switching between PCM and DSD) and cases of early failures in some units have been pointed out by users. When receiving repairs within warranty, products must be returned to their Chinese facility, with time and costs potentially borne by users. Compared to traditional brands with extensive domestic support networks, this represents a clear weakness requiring low evaluation.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

SMSL's design philosophy is extremely rational in its singular focus on "achieving the highest measured performance at minimum cost." Their approach of efficiently adopting latest components while thoroughly reducing costs in areas not directly contributing to performance (e.g., overly luxurious enclosures) represents a logical strategy for maximizing pure performance-to-price ratio. Their products reflect a clear will to eliminate emotional added value and pursue engineering rationality.

## Advice

If your goal is to minimize noise and distortion in your system's signal path upstream while keeping budget low, SMSL represents one of the most prudent choices. Their astonishing cost-performance allows no other brands to compete. They will demonstrate their true value maximally in modern, rational system building centered on PC audio with active EQ and DSP utilization.

However, you must understand that purchases involve certain risks. Should you encounter failures or firmware troubles, you cannot expect extensive domestic support. Whether to accept such risks for overwhelming performance or choose more expensive brands as insurance depends on user values.
