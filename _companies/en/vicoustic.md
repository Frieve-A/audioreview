## Overview

Vicoustic (Visound Acústica S.A.) is a leading Portuguese acoustic solutions company founded in 2007, specializing in innovative acoustic panels and sound treatment products. With global presence in over 70 countries, the company has established itself as a significant force in the acoustic treatment industry. Their product categories include acoustic treatment solutions, acoustic panels, sound insulation products, and specialized panels for various spaces including home cinema, studios, offices, restaurants, and schools. The company established its Research Centre in 2012, featuring multifunctional testing facilities with advanced equipment including B&K microphones for precise sound analysis. Vicoustic has received recognition through awards including Red Dot and Visual Grand Prix for design excellence, while maintaining strong commitment to environmental responsibility through sustainable manufacturing practices.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Vicoustic products demonstrate measurable acoustic performance with NRC (Noise Reduction Coefficient) values ranging from 0.75 to 0.95 across their product lines. The VicSpacer Plus MKII with Flat Panel VMT achieves NRC 0.95, while VicPattern Ultra Wavewood MKII reaches NRC 0.80, indicating good broadband absorption performance [1]. Wave Wood panels provide maximum absorption between 400 Hz and 1 kHz, with combination of absorption and diffusion at higher frequencies [2]. However, multiple independent sources confirm significant limitations in low frequency absorption due to insufficient panel thickness, with products described as not performing well in low frequencies because "they simply are not thick enough" [3]. This represents a fundamental limitation for comprehensive room treatment, particularly for applications requiring full-range acoustic control. While mid-to-high frequency performance is competitive with industry standards, the thickness constraint limits effectiveness in the critical bass frequency range essential for complete acoustic treatment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Vicoustic demonstrates strong technological advancement through proprietary VMT (Virtual Material Technology) innovation using VicPET Wool manufactured from recycled ocean plastic bottles. The company recycles 227 plastic bottles for each 8-unit box of Flat Panel VMT, creating 100% recyclable products with no glue or fabric adhesives [1]. Their in-house Research Centre, established in 2012, features advanced multifunctional testing facilities including an Innovative Acoustic Chamber with 4-ton mechanical walls and sophisticated B&K microphone equipment for precise sound analysis [1]. VMT technology enables innovative dyeing techniques that simulate concrete, marble, wood, and other materials with realistic appearance while maintaining acoustic functionality. The VMT family has achieved Indoor Advantage Gold certification by SCS Global Services and contributes to LEED, WELL, RESET, and BREAM green building rating systems [1]. This combination of environmental innovation, proprietary material development, and advanced testing capabilities represents significant technical sophistication within the acoustic treatment industry.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Vicoustic Flat Panel VMT pricing at 14.41 USD per square foot is expensive compared to GIK Acoustics FlexRange 242 panels [5]. GIK 242 provides superior acoustic performance with NRC=1.05 at 9.88 USD per square foot, equipped with broadband absorption, aesthetic design options, environmental sustainability, and modular installation systems [6]. GIK panels are equivalent-or-better in function and measured performance while offering clear pricing advantages. CP = 9.88 USD ÷ 14.41 USD = 0.686. When rounded to the first decimal place, this becomes 0.7, indicating that Vicoustic represents expensive pricing within the market for equivalent-function acoustic panels. While GIK provides superior acoustic performance and significantly lower cost, Vicoustic's environmental credentials and aesthetic design options are insufficient to justify the price premium.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Vicoustic provides above-average reliability support with a 3-year warranty period exceeding the industry standard of 2 years. Products undergo strict quality and shipping control protocols to ensure delivery in perfect condition, with warranty covering material and manufacturing defects during appropriate use [1]. The passive acoustic panel construction with no moving parts represents inherently robust design resistant to degradation and failure. Global presence in over 70 countries provides extensive support infrastructure through vendor and distributor networks, though support is primarily dealer-based rather than direct manufacturer support. Warranty claims require detailed problem descriptions with supporting photographs and original purchase documentation, following standard industry practices. The company ensures adequate customer service and provides rectification of defects or product replacements during the warranty period, with clear procedures for accessing support through their website contact channels [1].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Vicoustic demonstrates strong design rationality through scientific approaches to acoustic measurement and development, maintaining proper research facilities with advanced testing equipment for measurable performance verification. Their environmental responsibility initiative using recycled ocean plastic bottles shows rational cost-effective sustainability that creates meaningful environmental impact while maintaining product functionality [1]. The establishment of a dedicated Research Centre with multifunctional testing capabilities indicates commitment to measurement-focused development rather than subjective approaches. Their design philosophy focuses on providing neutral acoustic environments for clear audio experiences without distortions, combining "engineered systems with stunning design" to create measurable acoustic improvements [1]. However, premium pricing appears partially driven by aesthetic considerations rather than purely acoustic performance improvements, as competitors achieve equivalent acoustic results at significantly lower cost. The company's rational approach includes contributions to recognized green building standards and scientific certifications, though the cost structure suggests some emphasis on visual design over pure performance optimization.

## Advice

Vicoustic is suitable for users seeking acoustic treatment solutions that combine measurable performance with aesthetics and environmental responsibility. Their products excel in applications where visual design is equally important as acoustic function, such as visible installations in home theaters, offices, or commercial spaces where appearance significantly impacts the overall design. The environmental credentials make them suitable for projects pursuing green building certifications or sustainability goals.

From a cost-performance perspective, Vicoustic is expensive compared to products like GIK Acoustics FlexRange 242 panels, representing premium pricing within the market for equivalent-function acoustic panels. Users prioritizing pure acoustic performance per dollar should consider alternatives like GIK 242 or ATS Acoustics panels, which provide equivalent or superior acoustic results at significantly lower pricing.

Cases where Vicoustic should be chosen include: when aesthetic appearance is extremely crucial to the installation, when environmental sustainability is a project requirement, and when build quality justifies the price premium. For applications requiring maximum low-frequency absorption, consider supplementing with thicker bass trap solutions or selecting competitor products with superior low-frequency performance. Conduct thorough acoustic analysis to ensure the mid-to-high frequency focus aligns with your specific room treatment needs before purchase.
