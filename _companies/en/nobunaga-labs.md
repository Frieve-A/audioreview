## Overview

Nobunaga Labs was established in 2014 by WiseTech Inc., a Tokyo-based company founded in 2006. The brand specializes in consumer earphone and headphone cables for portable audio, DJ, and professional applications. Their product portfolio spans six series ranging from 89 USD to 429 USD, including Entry, Advance, Combine, Supreme, Vision, and Inspire NEO series. The company emphasizes proprietary cryogenic processing technology and claims to deliver "dynamic and rich sound with excellent separation capabilities" through various OFC conductor configurations and premium materials.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Nobunaga Labs produces high-priced audio cables making explicit claims of audible sound quality improvements including "dynamic and rich sound," "clear, speedy sound," and "enhanced presence and soundstage reproduction." However, no ABX blind test evidence or equivalent scientific audibility verification has been provided for these claims. The company's specifications focus on conductor materials (tin-plated/silver-plated OFC), strand counts (19-133 per core), and proprietary cryogenic processing at -156°C, but provide no measured performance data demonstrating audible differences compared to standard cables. Claims regarding "eliminating distortion of molecular arrangement" and "reducing electrical resistance, noise and distortion" through cryogenic processing lack scientific substantiation. According to established evaluation criteria, high-priced products claiming audible sound quality improvement without ABX blind test evidence receive minimum scientific validity ratings.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Nobunaga Labs employs proprietary cryogenic processing at -156°C for 72 hours and uses various OFC configurations with tin/silver plating. The company designs cables in-house with specifications including 4-core to 8-core configurations, 133 strands of ultra-fine high-purity oxygen-free copper per core, and 24K gold plating for connections. However, the underlying cable technology represents incremental improvements to mature approaches rather than cutting-edge innovation. While the cryogenic processing provides some technical differentiation, it has not been demonstrated to provide measurable performance advantages over standard manufacturing approaches. The 8-core configurations and high strand counts are widely available from competitors at significantly lower prices, limiting the competitive advantage duration and technology desirability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Nobunaga Labs Entry Series cables cost 89 USD, while equivalent-or-better alternatives are available at significantly lower prices. The TRN 8-core Silver-Plated OFC Cable provides equivalent user-facing functions (MMCX connectors, balanced/single-ended options, 8-core vs 4-core minimum, silver-plated OFC materials) at 10 USD. Equipped with equivalent connector options and equal-or-better core configurations, the TRN cable delivers the same fundamental cable functionality at a fraction of the cost. CP = 10 USD ÷ 89 USD = 0.11, rounded to 0.1. This evaluation is based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering conductor types or configurations that do not affect user-visible functions.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Nobunaga Labs products come with 6-month local warranty through authorized dealers, substantially shorter than the industry standard 2-year warranty period. Multiple documented user reports indicate significant durability concerns, with cables failing within "a few months under standard use." Identified weak points include lack of strain relief around connectors, MMCX connector wear over the ear, and connection issues with some devices. Users have reported cable noise transmission due to stiff sheathing, with one reviewer stating they "hadn't experienced a cable as noisy as this." The shortened warranty period combined with documented failure patterns suggests limited manufacturer confidence in long-term reliability. Support infrastructure relies primarily on dealer-based systems rather than direct manufacturer support.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Nobunaga Labs follows a design philosophy emphasizing subjective sound quality claims and premium materials without scientific validation. The company's approach prioritizes "boundless passions for music" and subjective listening qualities over measurable performance improvements. Investment in proprietary cryogenic processing, 24K gold plating, and high strand counts provides no demonstrated audible benefits while significantly increasing costs. Claims of "flawless performance and sound" are based on subjective evaluation rather than measurement data. The company charges premium prices for materials that provide no measurable performance advantage over general-purpose cables that achieve equivalent functionality. This approach contradicts scientific audio engineering principles by prioritizing marketing claims over objective performance data and represents inefficient cost allocation relative to functional improvements.

## Advice

Nobunaga Labs targets consumers seeking premium cable upgrades with subjective sound quality claims. However, objective evaluation reveals fundamental issues: no scientific evidence supporting audible improvements, poor cost-performance ratio with 7-10x price premiums over equivalent alternatives, documented reliability concerns with shortened warranty coverage, and design philosophy prioritizing subjective claims over measurable performance. Consumers seeking functional cable upgrades should consider TRN or NICEHCK alternatives that provide equivalent connectivity and specifications at significantly lower prices. Those specifically requiring Nobunaga Labs products should be aware of durability limitations and shortened warranty coverage. The company's premium pricing is not justified by corresponding performance advantages, making these products unsuitable for value-conscious purchasers seeking measurable audio improvements.
