## Overview

PSI Audio, manufactured by Relec SA in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland, has specialized in professional active studio monitors and revolutionary active bass traps since 1977 [1]. The company positions itself as a premium manufacturer emphasizing "absolutely accurate reproduction" through 100% analog circuitry, handcrafted Swiss manufacturing, and proprietary technologies including AOI (Adaptive Output Impedance), CPR (Compensated Phase Response), and AVAA active bass trap systems [1]. Their product lineup includes the flagship A25-M three-way monitor, mid-field A21-M, compact A14-M series, and innovative AVAA active bass traps that replace passive acoustic materials up to 45 times their size [2][3][4].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

PSI Audio demonstrates mixed measured performance results. The A25-M achieves excellent frequency response precision of ±1.5dB (38Hz-20kHz), significantly exceeding transparent level requirements [2]. However, manufacturer-specified THD limits reveal potential concerns: the A21-M specifies less than 1.4% THD (90Hz-12kHz) [3] and A14-M specifies less than 1.8% THD (95Hz-18kHz) [4], with these maximum thresholds exceeding the 1% problematic level for speakers. While frequency response capabilities approach world-class levels, harmonic distortion performance falls into problematic ranges. The combination of excellent frequency linearity offset by suboptimal distortion characteristics places PSI Audio's measured performance between problematic and transparent levels, with conservative evaluation applied due to reliance on manufacturer specifications.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

PSI Audio demonstrates exceptional technical sophistication through proprietary analog innovations developed over 47 years [1]. Core technologies include AOI real-time driver current monitoring with automatic amplifier impedance optimization [4], CPR analog all-pass filter phase compensation maintaining sub-0.6ms latency [4], ALG advanced waveguide design for optimized tweeter directivity [4], and revolutionary AVAA active bass trap technology using real-time pressure sensing and driver compensation [4]. Class G/H amplification architecture provides high-efficiency precision control [4]. These technologies represent significant competitive advantages requiring years for competitors to replicate, with clear industry desirability and strong patent portfolios. The limitation lies in the analog-only approach, deliberately avoiding digital signal processing integration that could enhance performance capabilities [1].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

PSI Audio exhibits significant cost-performance limitations when compared with equivalent-or-better alternatives. Using the A14-M (2,888 USD per pair [6]) as representative analysis: frequency response 56Hz-22kHz (-6dB) with ±2.5dB tolerance, 1.8% THD, 101dB single/112dB pair SPL, and professional balanced connectivity [4]. The ADAM Audio T7V (332 USD per pair [7]) provides superior performance: wider frequency response 39Hz-25kHz (-6dB), dramatically better 0.5% THD, equivalent 110dB pair SPL, and identical professional connectivity [5]. CP calculation: 332 USD ÷ 2,888 USD = 0.115. The ADAM T7V is judged equivalent-or-better because it provides superior frequency response range, dramatically better THD performance, and equivalent SPL capabilities with the same professional connectivity.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

PSI Audio provides exceptional reliability and support infrastructure. Warranty coverage includes 5 years on electronics and transducers, 2 years on wooden cabinets, exceeding industry standards [1]. Global distributor network maintains regional stock, demonstrations, and comprehensive after-sales service, with authorized dealers providing first-level support [1]. Swiss factory backup ensures direct support when local distributors unavailable [1]. Handcrafted manufacturing with individual component testing, matching, and calibration demonstrates meticulous quality control [1]. Simple analog construction design inherently resists degradation compared to complex digital systems. 47-year manufacturing history provides strong reliability track record with proven longevity [1]. Construction quality, warranty terms, global support infrastructure, and historical reliability performance significantly exceed industry averages.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

PSI Audio's design philosophy demonstrates contradictory rationality elements. Positive aspects include comprehensive measurement protocols, individual component testing and matching, and scientific accuracy focus through extensive calibration procedures [1]. However, the categorical rejection of DSP technology contradicts rational engineering principles where digital signal processing demonstrably achieves superior measured performance at reduced cost [1]. Swiss handcrafting emphasis adds significant costs without demonstrated measurement performance benefits compared to alternatives [1]. Anti-digital bias actively rejects proven advances that achieve better measured results, limiting functional integration possibilities [1]. While measurement practices demonstrate scientific rigor [1], the analog-only philosophy creates competitive disadvantages in both measured performance optimization and cost-effectiveness, representing irrational rejection of evidence-based engineering improvements.

## Advice

PSI Audio serves specialized markets requiring premium Swiss craftsmanship and proprietary analog technologies, particularly professional studios prioritizing brand heritage and analog circuit philosophy over measured performance optimization [1]. Consider PSI Audio when brand prestige, handcrafted construction, and analog-only signal path represent essential requirements beyond measured performance criteria. However, budget-conscious professionals should evaluate alternatives like ADAM Audio T7V providing superior measured performance at dramatically lower cost (332 USD vs 2,888 USD per pair) [5][6][7]. Studios requiring cost-effective transparency should prioritize measured performance over manufacturing philosophy. PSI Audio's exceptional support infrastructure and reliability make sense for mission-critical applications where downtime costs exceed equipment premiums [1], but measured performance and cost-performance analysis strongly favor modern alternatives for most professional applications.
