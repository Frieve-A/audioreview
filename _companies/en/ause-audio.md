## Overview

Ause Audio is a small-scale Japanese audio manufacturer established by its founder in their early 30s. The representative WATERFALL series integrated amplifiers employ Class-D amplifier technology using Dutch Hypex's nCore modules, promoting sound quality that pursues "excellent separation." The company's philosophy is "prioritizing sound quality over sales, with the ability to continue business even if audio products are not profitable." The flagship product WATERFALL Integrated 250 (2400 USD) featured an AK4497 DAC + nCore amplifier configuration, offering four operational modes: DAC-only, power amplifier-only, integrated, and external preamplifier support.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

The WATERFALL Integrated 250's measured specifications are excellent, with THD+N approximately 0.001% (1kHz, based on Hypex NC252MP real measurements), noise floor below 30µV (0-20kHz), and output impedance around 1.5mΩ, representing performance that exceeds transparent levels. The Hypex nCore module (NC252MP) delivers 250W@4Ω output with frequency response 10Hz-50kHz (+0/-3dB), clearing the transparent levels in measurement criteria including SNR over 120dB, crosstalk below -70dB, and IMD below 0.02%. Power supply performance achieves significant noise reduction, demonstrating technical improvements that contribute to scientifically audible sound quality enhancement. However, these figures are primarily due to Hypex's existing technology.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The company employs Hypex nCore modules as the foundation while adopting AK4497+OPA1632+AD812 configuration for the DAC section, implementing optimized layout design for clock, DAC, and output analog circuits. The four operational mode switching function and full-balanced connection between DAC and amplifier sections represent technically rational design choices. However, the core nCore amplifier section relies entirely on Hypex's off-the-shelf design, with limited weight given to proprietary technology development. While DAC peripheral circuit optimization is commendable, it cannot be considered industry-leading proprietary design technology.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

As a competing setup with equivalent or superior functionality and measured performance to the WATERFALL Integrated 250 (2400 USD), the combination of Topping DX3 Pro+ DAC (146 USD) + Fosi Audio V3 Mono pair (267 USD) totals 413 USD. This offers DAC functionality, 240W@4Ω output, THD+N below 0.006%, SNR over 123dB, and XLR/RCA inputs, providing equivalent user-facing functionality including balanced connections. Cost-performance calculation: 413 USD ÷ 2400 USD = 0.172. Similar integrated options like SMSL DA-9 (250 USD) also provide comparable performance. These comparisons reveal low cost-performance levels.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While promoting long-term support through the founder's young entrepreneurship, many products including the WATERFALL Integrated 250 are discontinued or unavailable on the official site, with updates like V2 canceled due to semiconductor shortages and market changes. As a small enterprise, concerns remain regarding long-term repair systems and parts supply, with limited public information on warranty and support. Product lineup continuity is unstable, presenting challenges for reliability below industry average.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While the sound quality philosophy pursuing "excellent separation" holds scientific meaning, questions arise regarding rationality in product development. Considering competing products achieve equivalent performance at significantly lower costs using Hypex nCore technology, the necessity for high-priced dedicated audio equipment is not established. In situations where equivalent or superior performance is inexpensively achieved through general-purpose Class-D combinations, proprietary technology and added value to justify price premiums are lacking. Price increases due to "audio-dedicated design" without scientific backing are not rational.

## Advice

While Ause Audio's products are technically excellent, they cannot be recommended from a price competitiveness perspective. For equivalent or superior sound quality, alternatives like Topping DX3 Pro+ DAC combined with Fosi Audio V3 Mono or integrated options like SMSL DA-9 exist, demonstrating equivalent results in scientific measurements while being more affordable. These offer cost-performance several times superior, often exceeding Ause Audio in measured performance. In audio selection, emphasize objective measurement data and price relationships over brand premiums or "dedicated design" claims. "Excellent separation" can be achieved with affordable high-performance Class-D amplifiers.
