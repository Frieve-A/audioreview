## Overview

Established in 1996 in Haimhausen near Munich, Germany, RME is a global leader in professional audio interfaces, providing top-tier products for music recording, broadcasting, live sound, and audio analysis. The company's philosophy is "colorless, transparent sound," designed with faithful reproduction of original sound as the highest priority.

The proprietary "SteadyClock FS" technology integrated into all products achieves ultra-precise clock synchronization at the femtosecond level (1/1,000,000,000,000,000 second), delivering remarkable low-jitter performance. All catalog specifications are actual measured values, not component specification values, demonstrating the company's confidence in their technology. The ADI-2, Fireface, and Babyface series each provide consistent high sound quality while being optimized for different applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

RME's technology is clearly demonstrated through objective measurement data. The femtosecond-level clock precision achieved by SteadyClock FS technology shows results that significantly exceed other manufacturers' products in jitter measurements. The ADI-2 DAC FS provides all specifications including S/N ratio and THD as actual measured values, offering industry-leading transparency. The capability to reproduce 768kHz/32bit and DSD 11.2MHz is backed by reliable technology with 2.17 Giga FLOPS DSP processing power. Their scientific superiority has been proven through continuous use in professional environments, achieving precision used as measurement equipment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

RME's technology level is among the industry's highest. SteadyClock FS technology achieves femtosecond-level precision that other manufacturers find difficult to realize. The circuit design technology that minimizes sound quality differences between higher and lower-tier models while using high-performance ADC/DAC from AKM (AK5388/AK4413) is remarkable. They earn industry-leading reputation for driver stability, operating stably on both Windows and Mac, leading to adoption in large-scale live venues. DSP technology is also advanced, capable of executing internal processing like EQ, crossfeed, and spectrum analyzers without burdening the CPU. However, the pace of innovative new technology introduction is conservative, taking an approach that prioritizes reliability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

RME's overall cost-performance is at appropriate levels for professional quality, although significantly inferior to Chinese manufacturers in basic measured performance. Compared to world's cheapest products with equivalent basic measured performance, CP values are approximately 0.07 for Babyface Pro class, 0.4 for ADI-2 DAC class, and 0.3 for Fireface UFX+ class. However, considering total value including SteadyClock FS technology, proven reliability in 24-hour operation, and stable drivers for both Windows/Mac, they provide performance worth the price. Particularly in professional environments prioritizing driver stability and long-term reliability, there is value matching the initial investment.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

RME's reliability receives industry-leading evaluation. Their stability in professional live venues and 24-hour operating studios proves their reliability. They are unmatched in driver stability, operating stably on both Windows and Mac for extended periods. Product durability is high, maintaining high value in used markets. In Japan, Synthax Japan provides technical support as the authorized distributor, establishing a system that meets professional users' demands. Product warranty periods are appropriate, providing greater peace of mind for long-term use than other manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

RME's design philosophy is extremely rational and consistent. All design decisions are made based on scientific evidence toward the clear goal of "colorless, transparent sound." The adoption of SteadyClock FS technology results from scientific analysis of clock precision's impact on audio quality, with femtosecond-level precision improvements providing clear physical effects. The approach of providing catalog specifications as actual measured values demonstrates confidence in technology and transparency. The practical-focused design meeting professional environment demands represents complete elimination of occult elements and pursuit of pure technical superiority.

## Advice

RME is optimal for professional users seeking "faithful reproduction of original sound" and "absolute reliability." While prices are high, considering their technical superiority and long-term reliability makes them a worthy investment choice.

- **Professional Users**: Fireface UFX+ and ADI-2 Pro FS are standards. They provide reliability for 24-hour studio operation and large-scale live venues with measurement-grade precision.
- **Home Studio Users**: Babyface Pro FS is optimal. It realizes professional-grade sound quality in small-scale environments with USB bus power convenience.
- **Budget-Conscious Users**: Consider products like MOTU M2 or Focusrite Scarlett series that provide equivalent basic performance at lower prices. However, there are differences in driver stability and long-term reliability.
- **Used Market**: RME products maintain high value in used markets, making them an effective option for obtaining high quality while reducing initial investment.

RME products possess precision as "acoustic measurement instruments" beyond simple audio equipment. Their transparency and reliability should be considered investments that directly improve music production quality.
