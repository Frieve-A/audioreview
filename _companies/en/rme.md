## Overview

Established in 1996 in Haimhausen near Munich, Germany, RME is a global leader in professional audio interfaces, providing top-tier products for music recording, broadcasting, live sound, and audio analysis. The company's philosophy is "colorless, transparent sound," designed with faithful reproduction of the original sound as the highest priority.

The proprietary "SteadyClock FS" technology integrated into all products achieves ultra-precise clock synchronization at the femtosecond level (one-quadrillionth of a second), delivering remarkable low-jitter performance. All catalog specifications are actual measured values, not component specification values, demonstrating the company's confidence in their technology. The ADI-2, Fireface, and Babyface series each provide consistent high sound quality while being optimized for different applications.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

RME's technology is clearly demonstrated through objective measurement data. The femtosecond-level clock precision achieved by SteadyClock FS technology shows results that significantly exceed other manufacturers' products in jitter measurements. The ADI-2 DAC FS provides all specifications, including S/N ratio and THD, as actual measured values, offering industry-leading transparency. The capability to reproduce 768kHz/32bit and DSD 11.2MHz is backed by reliable technology with 2.17 Giga FLOPS DSP processing power. Their scientific superiority has been proven through continuous use in professional environments, achieving a level of precision that allows them to be used as measurement equipment.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

RME's technology level is among the industry's highest. SteadyClock FS technology achieves femtosecond-level precision that other manufacturers find difficult to realize. The circuit design technology that minimizes sound quality differences between higher and lower-tier models while using high-performance ADC/DACs from AKM (AK5388/AK4413) is remarkable. They earn an industry-leading reputation for driver stability, operating stably on both Windows and Mac, leading to adoption in large-scale live venues. Their DSP technology is also advanced, capable of executing internal processing like EQ, crossfeed, and spectrum analyzers without burdening the CPU. However, the pace of innovative new technology introduction is conservative, taking an approach that prioritizes reliability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

RME's cost-performance is at an average level when compared with products offering similar functionality and measured performance. To assess the company's overall CP, we compare it with functionally equivalent audio interface products.
- **Babyface Pro FS (approx. 130,000 JPY)**: Compared to the `MOTU M4 (approx. 40,000 JPY)`, which has core features of 2 mic preamps and 4-in/4-out, the CP value is about 0.31.
- **ADI-2 DAC FS (approx. 180,000 JPY)**: As this is a DAC product, it is compared with a similar category item, the `Topping D90III SABRE (approx. 130,000 JPY)`, yielding a CP value of about 0.72.
- **Fireface UFX III (approx. 400,000 JPY)**: As a professional unit with multi-channel I/O, it is compared with the `MOTU 828 (2024) (approx. 180,000 JPY)`, which has equivalent or better functionality and measured performance, resulting in a CP value of about 0.45.
The average of these values is approximately 0.49, leading to a score of 0.5. While not the best choice for pure price-to-performance ratio, RME's value lies in the absolute stability of its drivers and long-term reliability, which many users find justifies the price difference in a professional environment.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

RME's reliability receives an industry-leading evaluation. Its stability in professional live venues and 24-hour operating studios proves its reliability. They are unmatched in driver stability, operating stably on both Windows and Mac for extended periods. Product durability is high, maintaining high value in the used market. In Japan, Synthax Japan provides technical support as the authorized distributor, establishing a system that meets professional users' demands. Product warranty periods are appropriate, providing greater peace of mind for long-term use than other manufacturers.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

RME's design philosophy is extremely rational and consistent. All design decisions are made based on scientific evidence toward the clear goal of "colorless, transparent sound." The adoption of SteadyClock FS technology is a result of a scientific analysis of the impact of clock precision on audio quality, with femtosecond-level precision improvements providing clear physical effects. The approach of providing catalog specifications as actual measured values demonstrates confidence in their technology and transparency. The practical-focused design that meets the demands of professional environments represents a complete elimination of occult elements and a pursuit of pure technical superiority.

## Advice

RME is optimal for professional users seeking "faithful reproduction of the original sound" and "absolute reliability." While prices are high, considering their technical superiority and long-term reliability makes them a worthy investment choice.

- **Professional Users**: Fireface UFX III and ADI-2 Pro FS are standards. They provide reliability that withstands 24-hour studio operation and large-scale live venues with measurement-grade precision.
- **Home Studio Users**: Babyface Pro FS is optimal. It realizes professional-grade sound quality in a small-scale environment with the convenience of USB bus power.
- **Budget-Conscious Users**: Consider products like the MOTU M-Series or Focusrite Scarlett series that provide equivalent basic performance at lower prices. However, there are differences in driver stability and long-term reliability.
- **Used Market**: RME products maintain high value in the used market, making them an effective option for obtaining high quality while reducing the initial investment.

RME products possess a precision that positions them as "acoustic measurement instruments" beyond simple audio equipment. Their transparency and reliability should be considered an investment that directly improves the quality of music production.
