## Overview

Audio Mijinco (オーディオみじんこ) is a small workshop in Akihabara, Tokyo, run by owner **T. Arakawa**. The catalog centers on handmade power and signal cables, the *SILVER HARMONIZER* “virtual ground” plugs (e.g., 3.5 mm, RCA/XLR), and small accessories such as silicone bands. The shop operates a BASE online store and a physical counter at SEEKBASE. International shipping is **not available** (Japan domestic only). [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

For the core lineup (power cables, “virtual ground” plugs), we found **no credible third-party measurements or blind tests** demonstrating audible improvements versus properly specified standard cabling. Established engineering sources conclude that, in systems with competent power supplies, the last 1–2 m of mains cable does **not** improve THD+N, S/N, or frequency response; claims rely on misconceptions about noise pickup and grounding. Similarly, “grounding boxes/virtual ground” accessories lack controlled evidence of measurable, audibly relevant benefits. Representative technical discussions and measurements concur that any differences, if present, sit below audibility thresholds. [11][12][13][14]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The engineering approach emphasizes artisanal construction (e.g., DF-OFC conductors, custom housings, hand assembly/QBT treatment) rather than verifiable performance mechanisms. The *SILVER HARMONIZER 3.5 ADVANCE* (4N silver lead to sleeve/“float” structure) and OROCHI-series cable descriptions are implementation-focused but provide **no** measured performance deltas versus standard, safety-compliant cables. [2][4][9]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Company-level CP is computed as a **weighted average in USD** (weights reflect category prominence):

- **Power cable (50%)**: OROCHI GR3 (1.8 m) **77,000円 ≈ 513 USD**. Comparator: a standard safety-rated JIS/NEMA–IEC C13 cord (1.8–2.0 m) widely available at **≈ 10 USD** class (e.g., Ainex 1.8 m is 1,360円 domestically; ≈ 9.1 USD).  
  **CP_1 = 9.1 ÷ 513 = 0.0177** → 0.0 after rounding. [4][6]

- **“Virtual ground” plug (30%)**: SILVER HARMONIZER 3.5 ADVANCE **10,800円 ≈ 72 USD**. Comparator: **Vortex HiFi 3.5 mm Jack A.I.O.** (similar interference-reduction claim), **EUR 6.95 ≈ 7.6 USD**.  
  **CP_2 = 7.6 ÷ 72 = 0.106**. *Both rely on manufacturer claims; no independent measurements.* [2][8]

- **Silicone band (20%)**: AUDIO MIJINKO® silicone band (2-pack) **1,000円 ≈ 6.7 USD**. Comparator: mass-market **silicone ties 2-pack at USD 2.99**.  
  **CP_3 = 2.99 ÷ 6.7 = 0.448**. [10][7]

**Weighted average CP = 0.5×0.0177 + 0.3×0.106 + 0.2×0.448 ≈ 0.130 → 0.1** (1-decimal rounding). Result: materially **poor price-to-function**, especially for power cables.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Hand assembly and small-batch production can help individual QC, but formal metrics (RMA/MTBF) and warranty terms are undisclosed. Build/custom lead time is typically **~10 days** for cables; shipping is domestic-Japan only. Overall support outlook is average for a boutique operation. [4][5][1]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Persistently promoting ultra-high-priced cables and “virtual ground” accessories **without** controlled, audibly relevant measurements is **highly irrational** from a scientific standpoint. Authoritative engineering sources explicitly find no audible benefits from premium power cords and treat unmeasurable claims (e.g., “black background,” “soundstage depth” from cords/ground boxes) as non-scientific. The company’s design direction does not align with pathways that improve transparent-level metrics for hearing. [11][12][14]

## Advice

If you value **craftsmanship and aesthetics**, purchase accordingly—but do **not** expect measured sonic gains. For audible improvements, allocate budget to components with published, independently verified performance. For compliant power cords or cable management, **generic** options offer equal practical function at a fraction of the price. [6][7]
