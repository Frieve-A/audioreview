summary: "American cable specialist founded in 1980. Develops high-end cables using proprietary technologies like silver wire, single-crystal copper, and DBS (Dielectric Bias System). While some products show measurable electrical characteristic improvements, audible changes are often not scientifically proven. With products reaching tens of thousands of dollars per meter, cost-performance is not recommendable. However, high-quality construction and beautiful finishes provide satisfaction as system components."

## Overview

AudioQuest is a cable specialist founded in 1980 by William E. Low in California. They offer a wide product lineup including audio cables, video cables, and digital cables, with price ranges from entry-level to ultra-high-end products.

The company's characteristic is thorough dedication to cable conductor materials and construction. They develop numerous proprietary technologies including PSC (Perfect Surface Copper) and PSS (Perfect Surface Silver) high-purity conductor technologies, and DBS (Dielectric-Bias System) that applies DC bias to dielectrics. However, the extent to which these technologies actually affect sound quality remains one of the most debated areas in the audio industry.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

While AudioQuest provides extensive explanations about their technology effects, results from independent third-party double-blind tests are limited. Some products show measurable improvements in high-frequency characteristics (skin effect) and noise shielding, but correlation with audible sound quality improvements in the audible range is not scientifically established. Regarding the DBS system, while theoretical explanations exist about dielectric polarization effects on sound quality, data objectively proving actual audible differences is lacking. Though many users report sound quality changes from cables, placebo effects cannot be ruled out.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As cable manufacturing technology, they operate at very high levels. Conductor purity control, precision of stranding structures, and coating material quality represent extremely high completion as industrial products. Particularly, complete air insulation structures adopted in the Mythical Creatures series and complex geometry designs are technically interesting approaches from electrical characteristic optimization perspectives. Digital products like HDMI 2.1 compliant cables demonstrate solid technical capability in signal transmission reliability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

While professional cables with equivalent electrical characteristics (resistance, capacitance, inductance) can be obtained for USD 7, AudioQuest mid-range products cost over USD 670, resulting in CP = USD 7 รท USD 670 = 0.01. Top-tier WEL Signature series (over USD 6,700 per meter pair) can achieve equivalent measured characteristics with cables manufacturable for around USD 67, yielding CP = USD 67 รท USD 6,700 = 0.01. When evaluated purely on electrical performance, cost-performance is extremely low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

As a company with over 40 years of history, product quality control and customer support are well-established. Premium products include lifetime warranties, with sincere responses to initial defects and age-related issues. In Japan, authorized distributor Yukimu provides long-term support, with after-sales service systems well-organized. Cable durability is also high, withstanding decades of use when properly handled.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

They adopt design approaches based on electrical theory, but tend to overestimate effects on sound quality. For example, directional cable designs based on crystal structure orientation during manufacturing have extremely limited effects on low-frequency AC signals like audio signals. However, practical improvements like noise shielding and contact resistance reduction exist, making them not entirely irrational. Viewed as products providing psychological satisfaction as part of high-end audio systems, some rationality can be recognized.

## Advice

When considering AudioQuest cable purchases, consider the following points:

- **Beginners to Intermediates**: Starting with entry-level Golden Gate or Evergreen is recommended. These are relatively affordable with solid construction.
- **Digital Connection Priority**: Digital cables like USB and HDMI have certain value from standards compliance and signal quality perspectives.
- **Final System Tuning**: High-priced cable investment should be considered after basic systems including speakers and amplifiers are complete.

Importantly, don't expect excessive sound quality changes from cables. Keep budget allocation to less than 10% of total system cost, focusing first on more impactful factors like room acoustic treatment and speaker positioning. Pre-purchase listening is essential - preferably utilize home system loan auditions when possible.
