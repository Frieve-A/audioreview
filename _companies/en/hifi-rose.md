## Overview

HiFi Rose, founded in 2017 as a division of CITECH (founded 1967), is a South Korean audio manufacturer specializing in network streaming and integrated amplification systems. The company differentiates itself through large touchscreen interfaces, video streaming capabilities, and proprietary GaN FET Class-D amplification. Products are designed and assembled in Seoul, Korea, targeting the premium segment with flagship models including the RS150B streaming DAC (4,995 USD), RA180 integrated amplifier (6,995 USD), and RS250A network streamer (2,695 USD).

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Third-party measurements show solid, mostly transparent performance with some caveats. For RS520, Stereophile measured A-weighted S/N of **84.5 dB** (ref. 2.83 V/8 Ω), with **THD+N >0.1%** in the low bass below ~500 Hz at 12.67 V (≈20 W/8 Ω), and clipping at **275 W/8 Ω** (1% THD) with both channels driven [1]. The RA180 exceeded its specs, clipping at **290 W/8 Ω** and **400 W/4 Ω** (1% THD), with A-weighted S/N **83.6 dB**; distortion rises in the top octave at higher frequencies as typical for some class-D designs [2]. RS250 measurements show **very low harmonic distortion** (e.g., third harmonic at **–116 dB**) and >90 dB channel separation above 3 kHz, dropping to ~62 dB at 100 Hz; power-supply spuriae increase with network attached but remain very low and inaudible in practice [3]. Overall, mid/treble performance is transparent; low-frequency distortion behavior on RS520 prevents a higher score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

HiFi Rose combines established high-end blocks (ESS Sabre DACs up to **32-bit/768 kHz** PCM and **DSD512**) with in-house GaN FET class-D amplification, large **6–14.9-inch** touchscreens, and **4K HDMI** video output on upper models. Integration of audio and video streaming with polished UX is advanced, but much of the platform relies on widely available chipsets and modules; originality is moderate rather than groundbreaking [3][7].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

For a company-level snapshot, RS250A (**2,695 USD**) is compared to the **cheapest** equivalent-or-better finished product available now: **Eversolo DMP-A6 Gen 2 (859 USD)** [5]. Functionally, DMP-A6 covers the core use case (bit-perfect network audio streaming with high-performance DAC and touchscreen UI); measured performance at the analog outputs is **audibly transparent** on the closely related DMP-A6 platform [4]. (Video playback can be added to A6 via a low-cost HDMI streamer if required.) The price gap is large, yielding a CP of ~**0.32 → 0.3**.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Firmware updates via RoseConnect are active (streaming services, UX). Warranty policy is **2 years** per the global site, but **varies by region**; major U.S. retailers list **1-year parts/labor** for RS-series units [9][10]. Build quality appears robust (machined aluminum, good thermal behavior reported in measurements), yet long-term failure data are limited given the brand’s short history.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The development direction (measurement-capable DACs, GaN class-D, integrated network platform) is rational. However, investment in very large touchscreens and video features increases BOM cost without clear measured fidelity gains, and claims implying “analog-like” sonic character lack measurable substantiation. Pricing strategy emphasizes luxury positioning more than measurement-driven efficiency.

## Advice

Choose HiFi Rose if you specifically want a premium, **touch-first** streamer with **integrated 4K video** (on upper models) and a polished, appliance-like UX. If your priority is transparent audio at the best price, **Eversolo DMP-A6 Gen 2** delivers the essential functions and measured fidelity for a fraction of the cost; pair with an inexpensive video device if needed. The RA180 shows strong power capability but faces sharp value competition from lower-priced integrateds with similar measured transparency.
