## Overview

Kenrick Sound Co., Ltd. is a Tokyo-based company specializing in restoration and modification of vintage JBL speakers. Founded by Kenji Hosoi, the company operates from Otaku, Tokyo, and has gained international recognition for meticulous restoration work on classic JBL models including the 43xx professional monitor series, Paragon, Harkness, and Hartsfeld designs. The company offers comprehensive restoration services including driver re-magnetization, crossover upgrades with silver wiring, and complete cabinet refinishing.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Given the absence of publicly verifiable, independent frequency response or THD/IMD datasets for Kenrick-restored speakers, the score is set to 0.5. For context, modern monitors providing reference-level transparency publish concrete specs/measurements: for example, Neumann KH 150 specifies 39 Hz–20.4 kHz at ±3 dB with maximum 112.7 dB SPL at 1 m (full space, 3% THD), and the KH 750 DSP subwoofer specifies 18–750 Hz at ±3 dB. These figures illustrate the type of objective data absent for Kenrick-restored units [2][3].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Kenrick Sound demonstrates advanced restoration techniques including driver re-magnetization, precision cabinet refinishing, and high-end crossover modifications. The company uses premium components such as silver wire sheathed in Teflon and audiophile-grade capacitors and chokes. Their technical expertise in vintage JBL reconstruction is evident through detailed restoration processes that exceed original manufacturing standards. The ability to completely rebuild drivers and achieve superior fit and finish compared to factory specifications indicates significant technical competency. However, the technology remains fundamentally restoration-based rather than innovative design advancement.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

We compare against the least expensive products that achieve equal or better functionality and measured performance across classes. As a representative Kenrick price point for large 43xx-class restorations, the company's blog lists JBL 4341 availability at ¥2,970,000 (2024/02) [1]. By contrast, a modern system meeting or exceeding the measurable bandwidth and transparency can be assembled with:

- Neumann KH 150 x2: ¥247,500 each → pair ¥495,000 (tax-in) [2]
- Neumann KH 750 DSP: ¥286,000 (tax-in, official store) [3]

Total modern reference system cost: ¥495,000 + ¥286,000 = ¥781,000.

Price ratio = Kenrick large 43xx price / modern measured-reference price = 2,970,000 / 781,000 ≈ 3.80.

The modern system also provides documented ±3 dB bandwidth of 18–20.4 kHz combined and reference-level linearity; Kenrick-restored systems lack published measurements to demonstrate equal transparency. Therefore, relative to measurable performance, Kenrick's cost-performance is low.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Reliability and support appear adequate based on customer feedback praising the company's communication and service quality. International shipping is handled professionally with custom transport crates and white-glove delivery service. The company maintains responsive customer service through multiple contact methods and has established distribution partnerships. However, warranty terms and long-term reliability data for restored speakers are not publicly documented. As a specialized restoration service rather than a manufacturing company, traditional reliability metrics are less applicable.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The philosophy of restoring vintage JBL speakers to beyond-original fit/finish is rational for preservation and collector markets. However, absent objective acoustic validation of improvements, and given that equivalent or superior measured performance is available from far cheaper modern systems, the design rationale scores lower when judged strictly by engineering transparency and value.

## Advice

Kenrick Sound serves a niche for collectors and enthusiasts seeking premium restorations of vintage JBL systems. Choose this service if you prioritize historical authenticity and craftsmanship and accept pricing around multi-million JPY per pair for large 43xx-class restorations. If your goal is objectively verifiable performance (FR linearity, SPL capability, room-calibrated response), a modern system such as Neumann KH 150 (pair) plus KH 750 DSP delivers documented specs at roughly ¥781,000, which is ≈74% cheaper than the representative Kenrick large 43xx price above while providing published ±3 dB 18–20.4 kHz system bandwidth and high SPL capability [2][3].
