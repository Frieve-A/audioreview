summary: "Final Inc. is a Japanese veteran audio manufacturer founded in 1974. Starting with cartridges, amplifiers, and speakers, they are now globally acclaimed for high-end headphones and IEMs. Their flagship models D8000 (planar magnetic) and A8000 (pure beryllium diaphragm) pursue innovative technologies, while the E1000-E5000 series provides high-quality acoustic experiences for entry users in the approx. USD 16-192 price range. Their technical prowess and commitment to sound quality are industry-leading, though cost-performance is limited due to the existence of more affordable alternatives."

## Overview

Final Inc. is a Japanese acoustic equipment manufacturer established in 1974. The company changed its name from S'NEXT Co., Ltd. to Final Inc. in 2020. For over 50 years, they have handled a wide range of products from cartridges, turntables, amplifiers, and speakers to headphones and IEMs. Currently, they are headquartered in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture.

The company employs its proprietary AFDS (Air Film Damping System) in the D8000 and uses a pure beryllium diaphragm in the A8000. The E1000-E5000 series ranges from approximately USD 16 to USD 192, with the E3000 winning the VGP Gold Award for four consecutive years.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Final's product development adopts scientifically-based approaches in acoustic engineering. The AFDS (Air Film Damping System) employed in the D8000 was developed using finite element method and laser Doppler vibrometer diaphragm simulation, theoretically and practically solving conventional weaknesses of planar magnetic types. The pure beryllium diaphragm in the A8000 has a scientific basis as an ideal diaphragm material next to diamond, with physical properties of specific gravity 1.85 and sound velocity 12,900m/s. The E4000 and E5000 series incorporate psychoacoustic research to avoid high-frequency masking effects, with effectiveness verified by many independent measurement institutions.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The A8000 employs a tetra-chamber structure (dividing the driver unit interior into 4 chambers). The D8000 improves low-frequency reproduction performance in 50mm drivers through AFDS technology. They maintain an integrated production system at their headquarters factory, possessing pure beryllium processing technology and stainless steel mirror finishing technology. Former engineers from Sony and Yamaha participate in development.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The representative D8000 (market price approx. USD 2,736) is compared to the HIFIMAN Ananda Nano (approx. USD 624), which offers equivalent or better measured performance, resulting in a CP of approx. 0.23. Similarly, the A8000 (approx. USD 1,361) compared to the Moondrop Blessing 3 (approx. USD 309) has a CP of approx. 0.23, and the E5000 (approx. USD 192) compared to the Truthear Hexa (approx. USD 70) has a CP of approx. 0.36. As the performance of these flagship products can be achieved with more affordable alternatives, the company's overall cost-performance is evaluated as limited.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The quality control through an integrated in-house manufacturing system and the top-class warranty period of 1, 2, or 5 years depending on the product are highly commendable. A comprehensive domestic after-sales service system is also maintained in Japan. However, the number of global support locations is limited compared to the largest manufacturers, which is reflected in the overall score. Publicly available RMA rates and failure report data are limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

The company makes technology choices based on scientific evidence. The A8000's beryllium diaphragm represents material selection based on physical properties of specific gravity 1.85 and sound velocity 12,900m/s. D8000's AFDS technology was developed using finite element method and laser Doppler vibrometer simulation. The E1000-E5000 series all employ 6.4mm drivers with tuning based on psychoacoustic research. No unscientific elements are included in the design.

## Advice

They provide product lineups suitable for users seeking products using the highest-grade technologies.

- **Price-range products**: E1000 (approx. USD 16), E3000 (approx. USD 35), E4000 (approx. USD 105), and E5000 (approx. USD 192) are available with 6.4mm drivers.
- **Premium models**: A8000 (approx. USD 1,361) with a pure beryllium diaphragm and D8000 (approx. USD 2,736) with AFDS technology are available.
- **Awards**: The E3000 has won the VGP Gold Award for four consecutive years.

A generous 1, 2, or 5-year product warranty, depending on the model, is available through authorized dealer purchases.
