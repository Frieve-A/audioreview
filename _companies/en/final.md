## Overview

Final Audio (stylized as "final") is a Japanese high-end audio manufacturer founded in 2007, with roots tracing to 1974. Based in Kawasaki, the company develops proprietary technologies including f-Core drivers, Air Film Damping System (AFDS), and patent-pending Perceptual Transparency Measurement (PTM) methodology. Current product portfolio spans flagship D8000 Pro planar magnetic headphones (4,299 USD), beryllium-diaphragm A-series earphones, and recent wireless UX series expansions.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Comprehensive third-party measurements from major evaluation sites (ASR, RTINGS) remain unavailable for Final Audio products. Partial frequency response data exists from Crinacle for D8000 Pro, A8000, and E5000 [2][3][5], with the D8000 Pro showing a prominent peak around 1kHz and a deep recession at 2.5kHz, indicating notable deviations from Harman target. No published THD, SNR, or IMD data from independent laboratories exists for any flagship model. Scientific Validity cannot be comprehensively evaluated due to insufficient standardized measurement data; the score of 0.5 reflects this data limitation and is applied conservatively.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Final demonstrates advanced proprietary technologies with patent-pending PTM evaluation methodology representing genuine innovation in audio measurement science [6]. The company developed f-Core driver architecture with brass housing and 30-micron ultrathin CCAW voice coils, AFDS technology preventing diaphragm-magnet contact in planar designs, and beryllium foil implementation. Complete in-house design and manufacturing capabilities since 2009, combined with 50+ years accumulated expertise, establish strong technological foundation despite some previously cutting-edge innovations becoming industry standard.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Evaluation across three representative products, weighted by product line significance: D8000 Pro (0.4), A8000 (0.3), E5000 (0.3).

**D8000 Pro (4,299 USD)**: Open-back, wired, over-ear headphone with no DSP or wireless functions. Comparator: HiFiMAN HE400SE (109 USD), an open-back wired over-ear headphone with equivalent user-facing functions. ASR measurements confirm HE400SE achieves THD below 0.2% and frequency response close to Harman target at typical listening levels [1]. The D8000 Pro shows notable frequency response deviations from Harman target (1kHz peak, 2.5kHz recession) per Crinacle measurements [2]. HE400SE demonstrates equivalent-or-better measured performance based on available data. CP = 109 USD ÷ 4,299 USD = 0.025.

**A8000 (1,999 USD)**: Wired IEM with MMCX detachable cable, no DSP or wireless functions. Comparator: Salnotes Zero (20 USD), a wired IEM with detachable cable and equivalent user-facing functions. Crinacle frequency response measurements show the Salnotes Zero achieves closer conformance to Harman target than the A8000's V-shaped response with significant midrange recession [3][4]. Comparison is provisional due to limited third-party THD data for both products. CP = 20 USD ÷ 1,999 USD = 0.010.

**E5000 (279 USD)**: Wired IEM with MMCX detachable cable. Comparator: Salnotes Zero (20 USD). Crinacle measurements show the E5000 exhibits a warm, bass-heavy response with deviation from Harman target, while the Salnotes Zero achieves closer target conformance [4][5]. Comparison is provisional. CP = 20 USD ÷ 279 USD = 0.072.

Weighted CP = (0.025 × 0.4) + (0.010 × 0.3) + (0.072 × 0.3) = 0.010 + 0.003 + 0.022 = 0.035 → 0.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Standard one-year warranty period falls below industry average, with dealer-based support system providing global coverage through authorized retailer network [7]. Repair services available during and after warranty with costs ranging 20-50% of retail price for out-of-warranty repairs. No systematic quality issues documented, though isolated driver failures reported in D8000 models and occasional seal problems in A6000 units. Service timeline up to seven working days represents adequate but not exceptional support responsiveness compared to direct manufacturer service models.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Final Audio demonstrates a measurement-focused scientific methodology through its proprietary PTM evaluation system, representing a genuinely scientific approach to audio development [6]. Continuous model progression from D8000 to D8000 Pro shows documented performance improvements, and recent TONALITE AI personalization technology reflects forward-looking functional integration. However, the company's premium product pricing (D8000 Pro at 4,299 USD, A8000 at 1,999 USD) is not proportionate to measured performance advantages over substantially cheaper alternatives, indicating that a significant portion of costs does not directly contribute to measurement performance improvement. Investment in expensive materials such as beryllium diaphragms, brass housings, and mirror-polished stainless steel has not been demonstrated to produce measurably superior results compared to conventional approaches at a fraction of the price.

## Advice

Final Audio suits users specifically valuing Japanese engineering heritage and proprietary measurement methodologies. The company's PTM evaluation approach and TONALITE AI personalization offer genuine technical innovation. However, limited third-party measurement verification and substantial price premiums relative to alternatives with equivalent-or-better measured performance require careful consideration. Budget-conscious users seeking maximum measured performance per dollar will find significantly better value from competitors such as HiFiMAN and Moondrop.
