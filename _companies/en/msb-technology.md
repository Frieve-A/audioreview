summary: "A group of engineers based in Silicon Valley pursuing the ultimate in digital reproduction. For over 20 years, they have continued in-house development of their discrete ladder DAC, challenging the limits of measured performance. Their products are designed with a modular structure that allows for upgrades, ensuring long-term value. However, their pursuit of technological ideals comes at an uncompromising price, with equivalent or superior measured performance available at 1/40th the cost, resulting in zero cost-performance rating. This brand embodies the pinnacle of engineering and its corresponding price."

## Overview

MSB Technology is a high-end audio manufacturer based in Silicon Valley, California. Since its founding, the company has consistently developed proprietary "ladder DAC" modules using discrete components rather than relying on off-the-shelf DAC chips. All products feature beautiful enclosures machined from CNC machines, and adopt a thorough modular structure from internal DAC modules to clocks and input/output. This enables future upgrades to accommodate technological innovations, embodying a philosophy that protects users' long-term investments.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

MSB's product development is strictly based on scientific and engineering principles. The company publicly states that "most acoustic achievements are the result of new designs and excellent measurements," and as claimed, all product advantages are backed by measurable specifications. Their proprietary ladder DAC and Femto clock technologies are developed with the clear goal of reducing noise and jitter to the extreme, and their remarkable measured performance has been confirmed by third-party reviews. Their approach of eliminating all unscientific claims and pursuing performance in a data-driven manner deserves a perfect score.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

MSB's technology level is among the industry's highest, alongside dCS. The core D/A conversion is realized through their proprietary discrete ladder DAC modules, which have been refined for over 20 years, symbolizing their high technical prowess. Furthermore, thorough in-house production from CNC-machined enclosures to PCB assembly maximizes the design's potential. The entire product line's modular design, enabling flexible response to future upgrades, represents extremely advanced design philosophy and technical capability.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.0} $$

Cost-performance is rated 0.0. MSB products are priced extremely high, befitting their exceptional technology. For example, the Reference DAC has a base price of USD 26,333 (¥3,950,000). Meanwhile, DACs like the Topping D90SE (approximately USD 599 / ¥89,850) provide world-class performance that matches or partially exceeds MSB products in key measurements such as SINAD (signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio) at less than 1/40th the price.
`CP = USD 599 ÷ USD 26,333 ≈ 0.022`
This fact demonstrates that MSB products have extremely low cost-performance from a pure performance-to-price ratio perspective. Their value lies in the technology itself, ownership satisfaction, and upgradeability.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Reliability and support are among MSB's strongest areas, earning a perfect score. Products are not only extremely robust but also feature modular structure throughout the design. From DAC modules to clocks, input/output, and even power supplies, future upgrades to higher-tier components or adaptation to new technologies are possible. This prevents expensive products from becoming obsolete and provides long-term protection for users' investments—an exemplary support system that serves as an industry model.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

MSB's design philosophy is extremely rational in its singular focus on maximizing measured performance. Features like high-performance passive attenuators to eliminate preamps from the signal path, and optical fiber USB inputs (Pro ISL) to completely isolate PC noise, are all designed with the clear purpose of reducing noise and distortion. There are no occult elements, and everything is based on engineering principles. Their stance of pursuing technological ideals regardless of cost represents pure rational expression.

## Advice

MSB Technology is one of the best brands for technically-oriented audiophiles who want to own the latest and best digital technology and experience its evolution through product upgrades. Their sound truly deserves to be called reference, extracting all the information from master sources as intended by creators.

However, if you aim to improve your overall system's sound quality within a limited budget, investing in MSB would be the most irrational choice. For the price of one MSB DAC, you could build a comprehensive sound system that includes a DAC with state-of-the-art performance, world-class speakers and amplifiers, and even professional room tuning—resulting in far superior overall sound.
