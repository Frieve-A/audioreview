## Overview

3e Audio is a Shenzhen-based audio manufacturer focused on making “great-sounding and high performance audio products that everyone can afford to enjoy.” The company primarily serves ODM/OEM clients and DIY enthusiasts, centering on Class D amplifiers built around TI’s TPA3251/3255 chips. Their latest finished amplifiers (A5 stereo, A7 mono/stereo) implement Post-Filter Feedback (PFFB) to push distortion lower and make frequency response highly load-invariant. The lineup emphasizes measurable performance and pragmatic feature sets over cosmetic luxury.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Independent measurements show 3e’s latest designs achieving transparent-level performance with margin. Archimago measured the A5 stereo at about **–104 dB THD+N at 5 W into 4 Ω (XLR)** and the A7 Mono at **better than –100 dB THD+N at 5 W into 4 Ω (XLR)**, with continuous “hi-fi” power around **120 W (A5) / just over 200 W (A7 Mono) at ≤0.1% THD+N**. Output impedance averaged **just over 10 mΩ** across 20 Hz–20 kHz, corresponding to **damping factor >300 (4 Ω)**, and the **frequency response remained essentially flat** into 2/4/8 Ω and a reactive speaker load—evidence of well-executed PFFB and load-invariant behavior. Single-ended (RCA) performance remains excellent albeit a few dB behind XLR, as expected. These results place the products decisively within transparent territory for distortion, noise, output impedance, and FR linearity. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Rather than inventing a new silicon platform, 3e concentrates engineering effort on **implementation quality**: optimized PFFB networks, careful gain structure, and low switching-noise control. The A5 uses **dual TPA3251** in PBTL for lower noise/distortion at moderate power, while the A7 variants use **TPA3255** for higher power. The finished units expose **socketed, user-replaceable op-amps (e.g., OPA1656, OPA1612, LM4562, etc.)** in DIP-8, and provide **balanced XLR/TRS and RCA** inputs with a **bypassable analog volume** and selectable RCA gain. This is modern, desirable engineering that competitors can emulate but still reflects meaningful know-how. [1][3]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

**Representative products and current market prices** (as listed when retail opened):
- **A5 (stereo, with 38 V / 5 A PSU): 240 USD**.  
- **A7 Mono (with 48 V / 5 A PSU): 180 USD**.  
Both are finished products with balanced inputs and PFFB. [2]

We looked for the **cheapest product(s) with equal-or-better user-facing functions and measured performance**. Sub-$300 competitors often cited—e.g., Fosi V3 Mono and Topping PA5 II/II+—do **not** surpass the A5/A7’s best-case THD+N at 5 W into 4 Ω under comparable conditions (V3 Mono is ≈**100 dB SINAD via XLR**, Topping PA5 II family tests are typically ≤~100 dB). Therefore, as of this review date we **did not find a cheaper equivalent-or-better** finished alternative; **CP = 1.0** by definition. [2][4][5]

> Equivalence note (why others are excluded): Even where power and I/O are comparable, the cited lower-cost models **do not meet or exceed** the A5/A7’s **< –100 dB THD+N @ 5 W / 4 Ω** benchmark alongside comparable features, so they are not valid comparators under the strict “equal-or-better” rule. [2][4][5]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The designs are **simple, cool-running Class D** with **external GaN PSUs**, few wear parts, and robust protection behavior noted under stress testing. The **warranty is 1 year** per the official manual; support is provided directly via **email/Skype**; and documentation is reasonably complete for a first-party offering. Long-term field data are still limited given the recent launch, and the warranty term is average rather than generous—hence a cautious but positive score. [1][3][6]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

3e’s philosophy is **measurement-first**: invest in the parts and topology (PFFB, proper gain staging, balanced inputs, quality op-amps) that lower distortion, flatten load-dependent FR, and improve usability (auto-sensing, volume bypass). Costs largely map to audible outcomes rather than cosmetics or mythology, which is rational for users seeking transparent amplification. [1][3]

## Advice

If you want **state-of-the-art transparency** from compact boxes at accessible prices, 3e’s A5/A7 line is an excellent fit. For listeners with **modest transparency needs** and strict budgets, mainstream options (e.g., Fosi/Aiyima/Topping budget amps) can sound audibly transparent in many setups, but on the lab bench they **don’t quite match** the A5/A7 on **sub-–100 dB** distortion with **load-invariant FR**. Choose **A5** if your speakers are average sensitivity and you value lowest distortion; pick **A7 Mono** when you genuinely need more headroom or a monoblock layout. Use **balanced input** and **volume-bypass** for the best numbers, and size the PSU to your load.
