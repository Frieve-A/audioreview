summary: "A long-established Japanese cartridge manufacturer. While its technical capabilities, with 85 years of history and complete in-house production, are commendable, its exclusive focus on analog records lacks rationality from modern audio quality standards and offers extremely low cost-performance."

## Overview

Nagaoka is a Japanese precision equipment manufacturer established in 1940, currently specializing in phonograph cartridge and stylus manufacturing. Starting with watch component manufacturing, the company leveraged its precision machining technology to enter diamond needle and cartridge production. As the world's only cartridge manufacturer that produces all components in-house—from samarium cobalt magnets to diamond tips, coils, and cantilevers—Nagaoka has survived in the industry for 85 years. The MP (Moving Permalloy) series is its main product line, covering a wide price range from the MP-110 to high-end models like the MP-500.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Even Nagaoka's top model, the MP-500, delivers specifications such as 27dB of channel separation, a frequency response of 20Hz-25kHz, and THD of 0.8% or less. Compared to the measurement standards table, a crosstalk of -27dB is near problematic levels (versus a transparent -70dB), and a THD of 0.8% significantly exceeds the transparent level of 0.01%. While these figures are relatively good for analog record playback, when compared directly with standard modern digital equipment (SNR 120dB, THD+N <0.001%, perfectly flat response), the fidelity to human hearing is at a markedly low level. Even considering the physical constraints of cartridges, the scientifically audible sound quality improvement is limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The Moving Permalloy (MP) design is a proprietary technology that replaces the heavy magnet of conventional MM types with a lightweight magnetic alloy to improve cantilever tracking performance. The complete in-house production system is excellent from a technical control perspective, and the accumulation of 85 years of precision machining technology is commendable. Advanced materials such as boron cantilevers and line-contact styli are also adopted. However, these are all improvements within the realm of analog technology and do not solve fundamental physical constraints like wow & flutter, noise, and distortion. From a modern technical standpoint, this represents the technical capability of excellent traditional craftsmanship.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

To evaluate the essential value of music reproduction, we must compare across categories. Apple's USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter (approx. 10 USD) provides playback quality with measured performance far superior to any Nagaoka cartridge. Compared to the flagship MP-110 (market price approx. 106 USD), the cost-performance is 10 USD ÷ 106 USD = 0.094. For the high-end MP-500 (market price approx. 531 USD), it becomes even lower at 10 USD ÷ 531 USD = 0.018. Considering the company's entire product line, the score must be evaluated as an extremely low 0.1.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

The company's 85-year history and continuous product supply demonstrate stability. Quality control is thoroughly managed through its in-house production system, ensuring a typical product life for a cartridge (recommended replacement stylus usage time). However, the company faces distribution issues in the American market and is still seeking a new distributor as of 2024. Detailed information about product warranties and support systems is limited globally, making the adequacy of worldwide support unclear. While stable support can be expected within Japan, its international reliability is rated at an industry-average level.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

A business policy focused exclusively on analog records is irrational from the standpoint of modern audio quality. Compared to the latest digital technologies, analog records inherently have physical limitations, including wow and flutter, surface noise, dynamic range, and frequency response. While improvement efforts like the Moving Permalloy technology are acknowledged, they do not resolve these fundamental analog limitations. The company continues to specialize in a playback method with intentionally measurable degradation rather than aiming for perfect fidelity from a digital source. The failure to apply its 85 years of technical expertise to digital domains or other fields cannot be considered a rational corporate strategy.

## Advice

Nagaoka cartridges are recommended only for enthusiasts who already own an analog record collection and prioritize the ritualistic experience and hobbyist aspects of this format. If pure sound quality for music appreciation is the priority, selecting a combination of a smartphone and an inexpensive, high-performance DAC adapter (like the Apple one) provides measurably superior transparency and convenience at a fraction of the cost. From a sound quality perspective, it is scientifically difficult to justify the investment in Nagaoka products.
