## Overview

ooopusX is a brand new audio company making their debut with the Op.24, a hybrid in-ear monitor that demonstrates remarkable technical sophistication for a first offering [1]. In an oversaturated audio market, the company has chosen to differentiate through genuine innovation rather than incremental improvements or price competition. Their debut product showcases proprietary "Tunable Acoustics" technology with a physical dual-mode tuning dial, representing a bold entry strategy that prioritizes user functionality and technical advancement. The company's engineering approach emphasizes simulation-oriented modeling, 3D printing experiments, and physical acoustic principles to achieve measurable performance improvements [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

ooopusX demonstrates below-average measured performance in their debut offering. The Op.24 provides wide frequency response coverage of 10-40kHz [1][2]. However, manufacturer-specified THD <1% falls into problematic territory for headphones, where 0.5% or above represents performance concerns. Independent measurement data confirms V-shaped frequency response characteristics with well-handled distortion performance [3]. While the company's engineering focus on distortion reduction through custom coaxial driver configuration shows promise [1], the measured THD performance remains within problematic range according to established audibility thresholds for headphone products.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

ooopusX exhibits exceptional technical sophistication for a new company. Their proprietary "Tunable Acoustics physical dual-mode tuning dial" with independent dual-channel electronic crossover represents genuinely innovative technology that eliminates traditional DIP switch limitations [1]. The company demonstrates strong design ownership with custom coaxial 10mm + 8mm dynamic drivers and cavity topology restructured through simulation-oriented modeling and 3D printing experiments [1]. Technical expertise is evident in advanced hybrid driver integration and ergonomic optimization [1]. The physical tuning mechanism combined with electronic crossover creates significant competitive advantage requiring substantial development time and know-how. This represents technology that other manufacturers would want to adopt, indicating high desirability and difficult-to-replicate implementation. The integration of analog mechanical systems with electronic crossover demonstrates cutting-edge approach to IEM design.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. The Op.24 is available in two variants: 3.5mm version (USD 49.99) and Type-C with mic version (USD 54.99) [2]. The Op.24 provides wired IEM, 2-mode tuning system, and detachable cable, with manufacturer-specified THD <1% confirmed. The 3.5mm version provides standard 3.5mm connectivity, while the Type-C with mic version adds Type-C connectivity and microphone functionality. Investigation of IEMs with 3.5mm connectivity, 2-mode tuning system, detachable cable, and manufacturer-specified THD <1% identified the CCA Rhapsody (USD 49.99) as the cheapest equivalent-or-better product, which shares the same price as the Op.24 3.5mm version [3]. In evaluation based solely on functionality and measured performance values, as no cheaper equivalent-or-better product with 3.5mm connectivity, 2-mode tuning system, detachable cable, and confirmed manufacturer-specified THD <1% can be identified, the Op.24 3.5mm version is positioned as the world's cheapest equivalent product with this feature set and measurement performance specification. For the Type-C with mic version, as no cheapest equivalent-or-better product with Type-C with mic functionality and confirmed manufacturer-specified THD <1% can be identified, it is similarly positioned as the world's cheapest equivalent product. CP = 1.0.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

ooopusX provides industry-standard reliability and support infrastructure as a new company. The Op.24 includes 2-year warranty coverage, 30-day return policy, and 180-day quality exchange/refund option through distributors [4]. Support infrastructure relies primarily on dealer-based systems with standard manufacturer warranty backing. As a new company, ooopusX has no established track record for long-term reliability assessment or failure rate data. The hybrid IEM construction with multiple drivers represents moderate complexity with no specific reliability concerns identified. Construction quality appears appropriate for the price category with lightweight design at 5.2g per side [1]. Unknown factors include long-term durability of the mechanical tuning dial and electronic crossover systems, which will require market experience to evaluate fully.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

ooopusX demonstrates rational aspects in functional improvements through the tuning dial system and measurement-focused development approach. Engineers utilize simulation-oriented modeling, physical acoustic principles, and 3D printing experiments for cavity topology optimization, representing measurement-focused development approach [1]. The physical tuning dial mechanism represents practical innovation that directly contributes to user functionality. However, the debut product Op.24's 2DD+4BA hybrid driver configuration and carbon fiber diaphragm adoption lack evidence of scientifically verified measurable performance improvements, representing technology choices with greater marketing significance across the industry. Per policy guidelines, "investing in quantities with no scientifically expected effects" and "manufacturer claims that appeal only to subjectivity without scientific verification are not highly evaluated." Furthermore, Op.24's <1% THD specification falls short of optimal performance levels available in competing products and does not contribute to achieving transparent levels in measurement results. The company's technology adoption demonstrates engineering focused on measurable acoustic improvements, but evaluation remains at average level due to scientifically unsubstantiated technology choices.

## Advice

For consumers seeking innovative hybrid IEMs with advanced tuning capabilities, ooopusX Op.24 offers competitive value proposition. The company's debut product provides sophisticated technology at reasonable price point, making it ideal for enthusiasts wanting cutting-edge features without premium pricing. Buyers should appreciate the physical tuning dial mechanism's practical advantages over traditional switches, especially for users who frequently adjust sound signatures. The 2-mode tuning system suits listeners who prefer simplified controls over complex multi-setting systems. New company status requires consideration of unknown long-term reliability, though standard warranty coverage provides reasonable protection. While distortion performance falls into problematic range per manufacturer specifications, the innovative tuning mechanism and engineering approach demonstrate promising technical direction. The carbon fiber composite dynamic drivers address the user's specific interest in carbon-based driver technology with documented distortion improvements.
