## Overview

EarFun is an audio brand established in 2018 in Shenzhen, China, operated by "Shenzhen Earfun Technology Co., Ltd." The company achieved rapid growth after the globally acclaimed "EarFun Free" launched in 2019 and "EarFun Air" in 2020. In 2020, they won two CES Innovation Awards, establishing their position in the industry within a short period. Currently, they focus on wireless earphones with noise cancelling features priced under 10,000 yen, popular among users who prioritize cost-performance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Does not reach transparency level. Air Pro 4's audio specifications lack verified THD+N measurements, making distortion performance assessment difficult. Frequency response is standard at 20Hz-20kHz±3dB but falls short of the transparency level of ±0.5dB. Noise cancelling performance reaches 50dB, which exceeds the 40dB standard for high-quality ANC and approaches the transparency level for noise reduction. The latest QCC3091 chip enables aptX Lossless support for 96kHz/24bit high-quality playback, but the auditory improvement effect is limited.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Below industry average technical level. Main products depend on Qualcomm's off-the-shelf chipsets with limited proprietary technology development. QuietSmart noise cancelling technology is claimed as self-developed, and the 50dB performance exceeds industry standard level. While basic technical requirements are met with 10mm dynamic drivers and diverse codec support, innovative designs or patent technologies are not evident. Product development centers on OEM design combinations with limited technical originality.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Air Pro 4 (10,400 yen) provides 50dB ANC performance that is not matched by cheaper alternatives. QCY MeloBuds Pro HT08 (6,750 yen) offers only 46dB ANC, representing inferior noise cancellation capability. No current wireless earbuds offer equivalent 50dB ANC performance at a lower price point, making the Air Pro 4 the most cost-effective option for this level of noise cancellation. CP = 1.0 as no cheaper equivalent exists.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Provides 18-month product warranty with Japanese language support system. Failure response is prompt with email contact within 24 hours, and replacement with new products when issues persist. However, user reviews report cases of failure after 2 months and charging issues. As a Chinese company, they have established a comprehensive support system, but basic product reliability has room for improvement. Firmware updates are possible through dedicated app, but update frequency and coverage are limited.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design achieving high functionality while keeping prices low is rational, with 50dB noise cancellation performance exceeding industry standards. The focus on practical features like multipoint connection and long battery life demonstrates scientific rationality. As wireless earbuds, they serve a necessary function that smartphone + external DAC/amp combinations cannot replicate due to portability requirements. The balance between cost reduction and performance optimization shows reasonable design philosophy.

## Advice

EarFun is worth considering as a viable option when seeking noise cancelling wireless earphones with superior ANC performance. The Air Pro 4's 50dB noise cancellation performance represents the current best-in-class level for this price point, with no cheaper alternatives offering equivalent noise reduction capability. While QCY MeloBuds Pro HT08 (6,750 yen) exists at a lower price, its inferior 46dB ANC performance makes it unsuitable for users requiring maximum noise cancellation. The 1.0 cost-performance ratio reflects the Air Pro 4's position as the most affordable option for 50dB ANC performance. Though measured performance does not reach transparency level, the Air Pro 4 offers leading noise cancellation specifications. The 18-month warranty provides adequate reliability coverage, making it suitable for users prioritizing maximum noise cancellation performance.
