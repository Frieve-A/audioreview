## Overview

CCZ is an emerging IEM manufacturer from China that aims to achieve HiFi sound quality at affordable prices. The company operates under the slogan "Born for HiFi Sound" and develops products in the low-price range, including the Coffee Bean, Melody, and Solo. They employ dual magnetic circuit 10mm DD (dynamic driver) technology and some hybrid designs (DD+BA), targeting entry-level music enthusiasts and first-time IEM buyers. The company focuses on designing and manufacturing high-value, cost-effective HIFI audio products by leveraging their technological development and supply chain advantages.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Most CCZ products adopt a typical V-shaped sound signature, emphasizing bass and treble while slightly recessing the midrange. The Coffee Bean claims 111±3dB sensitivity, 18±2Ω impedance, and a 20Hz-20kHz frequency response, but actual measurement data shows bass bloat and midrange recession. Hybrid models like the Melody also deviate significantly from scientifically transparent flat characteristics. Detailed measurement data from third-party organizations is limited, and verification of distortion performance, including THD, IMD, and crosstalk, is insufficient. While V-shaped tuning may appeal to consumers, it represents a problematic deviation from master source fidelity, resulting in a low scientific validity evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

CCZ's technical approach is around the industry average. Their main technology, the dual magnetic circuit 10mm DD driver, is an application of existing technology and lacks innovation. Some models adopt PU+PET composite diaphragms, but these are also combinations of established material technologies. The BA+DD hybrid configuration used in models like the Melody remains unclear regarding the actual nature of their custom BA drivers, with limited technical uniqueness. Peripheral technologies like 4N OFC cables and 0.78mm 2PIN connectors are also at an industry-standard level. No clear technical advantages contributing to improved measurement performance are confirmed, and no patents or technical papers have been published.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

As a company review, we evaluate the cost-performance of representative products and use their average as the score. First, the flagship product, "Coffee Bean" (approx. 16 USD), is one of the cheapest options considering its features and performance, even with competitors like the CCA CRA (approx. 16 USD) in the same price range. Its standalone CP is rated at 1.0. On the other hand, the hybrid model "Melody" (approx. 24 USD) faces competition from the KZ ZSN Pro 2 (approx. 20 USD), which offers a similar 1DD+1BA configuration at a lower price. Based on this, the CP is calculated as `20 USD ÷ 24 USD ≒ 0.83`, resulting in a score of 0.8. The average of these two products' scores, `(1.0 + 0.8) ÷ 2 = 0.9`, is taken as CCZ's overall cost-performance rating.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

CCZ is a relatively new company with limited long-term reliability data. For product warranty, they provide a standard 12-month warranty, but specific data on failure rates or MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) is not disclosed. In many markets, sales are mainly through platforms like Amazon, ensuring a certain level of support. However, the company's small scale limits its global support network. Since these products do not require firmware updates, this aspect is excluded from evaluation, but a sufficient track record for physical quality control and long-term durability has not been accumulated.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

CCZ's design philosophy adopts a consumer-oriented approach, prioritizing mass-appealing sound tendencies over scientific transparency. While V-shaped tuning tends to be favored by many listeners, it is irrational from the perspective of faithful master source reproduction. The strategy of claiming "HiFi" while keeping prices low matches market needs but deviates from true high-fidelity reproduction. The adoption of dual magnetic circuit DD technology contributes somewhat to measurement performance improvement, but its fundamental sound quality improvement effects are limited. While understandable as a differentiation strategy in the entry-level market, its contribution to achieving scientifically optimal sound quality is low.

## Advice

CCZ products offer value for first-time IEM buyers and budget-conscious users, but they are not recommended for those seeking scientifically optimal sound quality. If price is the main concern, the CCZ Coffee Bean (approx. 16 USD) is an affordable choice, alongside competitors like the CCA CRA (approx. 16 USD). However, for higher transparency, investing in the Moondrop Chu II (approx. 21 USD) is recommended. For a more affordable high-performance hybrid option, consider the KZ ZSN Pro 2 (approx. 20 USD). When choosing a CCZ product, one should understand the sound quality bias from its V-shaped signature. For long-term sound quality pursuit, it is wise to consider transitioning to products from manufacturers that adopt a more scientific approach.
