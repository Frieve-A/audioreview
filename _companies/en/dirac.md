summary: "Swedish acoustic technology company originating from Uppsala University. World leader in Digital Room Correction (DRC) technology that measures room acoustics and speaker characteristics to correct them toward ideal acoustics. Through advanced impulse response correction based on scientific evidence, they eliminate not only frequency response issues but also time-domain distortions. Adopted across professional venues, high-end audio, and car audio. While their effects are tremendous, maximizing performance requires considerable cost and learning commitment."

## Overview

Dirac is an acoustic technology company established in 2001 by researchers from Uppsala University in Sweden. Their core technology, "Dirac Live," uses digital signal processing (DSP) to correct audio distortions caused by room acoustics (reflections, standing waves, etc.) and speaker performance limitations. While many room correction technologies limit themselves to frequency response correction, Dirac's distinguishing feature is also correcting impulse response (time domain) related to sound attack and timing. This enables more accurate and natural soundfield reproduction, leading to adoption by audio manufacturers worldwide (ARCAM, NAD, Onkyo, etc.), car audio, and professional studios.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{1.0} $$

Dirac's technology is deeply rooted in established principles of acoustic physics and digital signal processing. Its effectiveness is based on an extremely scientific approach: measuring room acoustic transfer functions and generating inverse filters to correct the source. Specifically, it corrects both frequency domain disturbances (peaks and dips from room modes) and time domain disturbances (impulse response degradation from reflections). These correction effects can be clearly measured and visualized as improvements in frequency response and impulse response before and after correction, using dedicated microphones and software like REW. The differences are easily recognizable in ABX blind tests, with no occult elements whatsoever.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

They possess industry-leading technology. While many inexpensive room corrections use minimum phase filters that adjust only frequency response, Dirac Live employs mixed-phase filter technology that can independently correct frequency and phase characteristics. This enables bringing the waveforms (impulse response) disturbed by direct sound from speakers and room reflections closer to ideal conditions. Additionally, "Dirac Live Bass Control," which optimally integrates and controls multiple subwoofers, is highly advanced technology that manages multiple subwoofer phases and flattens low-frequency response across the entire listening area, with uniqueness that competitors cannot match.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

Dirac's technology is provided as software licensing, with pricing that is not inexpensive. For example, PC/Mac full-range stereo version licenses are sold at approximately USD 349. However, considering their effects, achieving equivalent improvements through physical room tuning would cost far more, making it reasonable from one perspective.

The most affordable alternative with equivalent performance is the combination of free measurement software **REW (Room EQ Wizard)** with **miniDSP 2x4 HD** (approximately USD 225 retail) and measurement microphone **UMIK-1** (approximately USD 79 retail). This USD 304 configuration enables frequency response and limited phase correction at levels approaching Dirac, though requiring manual operation.

Considering that the **miniDSP DDRC-24** with Dirac Live is sold for USD 499, the added value of automatic correction and impulse response correction can be evaluated at USD 195.

`CP = USD 304 (REW+miniDSP) รท USD 499 (DDRC-24) = 0.61`

However, AV amplifiers with standard Dirac Live (such as Onkyo TX-RZ50, approximately USD 1,399 retail) also exist, broadening the options. Here we evaluated the software's standalone value to determine the score.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

The software is very stable, with its reliability demonstrated by OEM adoption by major audio equipment manufacturers. Firmware and software updates are continuously provided, with new features added and compatibility improved. The official website provides detailed manuals and technical white papers, with well-established support systems. However, software setup and measurement processes require some specialized knowledge, creating a slight learning curve for beginners. Once configuration is complete, operation is very stable.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

Dirac's design philosophy is concentrated on the single point of "bringing reproduced sound as close as possible to master sources based on scientific truth," making it extremely rational. They eliminate unscientific audio myths and subjective "sound tuning," aiming to physically solve acoustic problems based on measurement data. Their approach focusing on impulse response importance and pursuing time-axis accuracy perfectly aligns with hi-fi (high-fidelity reproduction) ideals. Their marketing and technical explanations consistently use acoustic physics terminology and data, with no irrational claims evident.

## Advice

Dirac Live is one of the most powerful tools currently available for maximizing audio system potential. It can bring dramatic sound quality improvements to nearly everyone listening to music in imperfect typical listening rooms. Many issues like boomy bass, unclear midrange, and poor imaging are caused by room acoustics rather than speakers, and Dirac Live fundamentally corrects these problems.

When considering implementation, first verify whether Dirac Live can be added to your system. "Dirac Ready" compatible AV amplifiers or external DSP processors like miniDSP are required. While investment is necessary, the improvement effects are likely far greater than replacing speakers or amplifiers in the same price range. This is not an audio accessory but a scientific solution that improves system fundamentals.
