## Overview

DELA Audio is the successor to Melco Audio, a Japanese brand founded in 1975 in Nagoya and later integrated with Buffalo’s IT business. In July 2025 the company unified its branding globally under **DELA**, with products and engineering continuity maintained from the Melco era [1][12]. Current offerings focus on audiophile-oriented music libraries/servers (e.g., N100/N1), emphasizing robust storage, quiet mechanics, and network integration [2][3].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

For network music servers, the core question is whether they audibly improve playback versus any bit-perfect source feeding a competent DAC. Controlled measurements comparing diverse bit-perfect sources (phone, mini-PC, Raspberry Pi, laptop) into a modern DAC show **indistinguishable** analog output: dynamic range ≈120 dB, THD below 0.0001%, and jitter sidebands at ~**–140 dB**, i.e., far below audibility [5]. DELA’s hardware aims to reduce vibration and electrical noise, but with asynchronous USB/networked DACs the audible effect is unproven; improvements largely do not manifest at the DAC output under measurement. Therefore we set scientific validity at 0.5 pending rigorously controlled, source-audible evidence.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

DELA demonstrates solid in-house engineering: dedicated **PLAYER/LAN** ports and fanless designs for quiet operation [2]; support for formats up to **32-bit/384 kHz PCM and DSD512** [3]; and the HS-S2 (**Highly Stable Storage System**) mechanical isolation platform used across higher models [4]. Chassis/mechanical execution and power supply choices are thoughtful and well implemented, though the underlying compute architecture remains conventional.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.2} $$

Representative target: **DELA/Melco N100 2 TB**—**2,199 USD** street in the US [6].  
Cheapest equivalent-or-better alternative: **Roon Nucleus One**—**499.99 USD**, a turnkey music server with USB DAC output and network streaming to over 1,000 devices; storage via internal 2.5" bay, external USB, or NAS [7][8]. From a user-function/measured-performance standpoint (bit-perfect transport, high-res PCM/DSD to DAC limits), this is equivalent-or-better for library/server roles.

**Calculation:** 499.99 USD ÷ 2,199 USD = **0.227…** → score **0.2** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

Dealer documentation indicates robust warranty/support in several regions (e.g., **5-year** coverage for some models in the UK, HDD typically shorter) [9], while other outlets list **2-year** terms [10]. As part of the Buffalo group, DELA benefits from established global service infrastructure and long-running storage/network support programs [11]. Products are fanless with few moving parts, supporting inherently good reliability.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The design emphasizes quiet mechanics, stable storage, clean power, and network isolation [2][4]. However, because equivalent functions and transparent-level measured performance are achievable with far less expensive general-purpose or turnkey servers (e.g., Nucleus One) [7][8], the **necessity** of a premium dedicated server is limited. In addition, audible uplift versus other bit-perfect sources remains unsubstantiated under controlled tests [5]. Net: rational engineering execution, but the **direction** does not currently deliver demonstrable audible gains or cost optimization proportional to price.

## Advice

Choose DELA if you want an integrated, quiet, appliance-grade library/server with refined mechanics, dedicated network topology, and dealer support. If your priority is pure bit-perfect transport to a capable DAC with minimal cost, a general-purpose or turnkey server such as **Roon Nucleus One** provides equivalent audible performance at a fraction of the price [7][8]. DELA is best justified when its mechanical quality, UI/workflow, and support ecosystem are valued more than raw cost efficiency.
