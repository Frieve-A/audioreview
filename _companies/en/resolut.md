## Overview

RESOLUT is a Russian high-end DSP brand established in 2015 under the concept of "uncompromising approach to digital signal processing." The company is backed by an international team of engineers and investors led by Russian developers, with all processors manufactured exclusively in Russia. RESOLUT positions itself as offering complete solutions rather than standalone products, targeting the premium car audio market with models including A-DSP (2,053 USD), J-DSP (3,667 USD), T-DSP MK2 (4,620 USD), and flagship M-DSP (6,280 USD) [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

RESOLUT's product specifications lack detailed measurement data necessary for proper performance evaluation. While the company provides basic frequency response specifications (2Hz-65kHz), critical parameters such as THD+N percentages, signal-to-noise ratios, crosstalk values, and dynamic range measurements are not publicly disclosed. Without measurable performance data meeting scientific criteria, the evaluation defaults to the standard 0.5 baseline according to framework guidelines.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

RESOLUT demonstrates sophisticated technical implementation across their product lineup. The flagship M-DSP employs dual ES9038PRO Sabre DACs with dual ADAU1467 processors for true 16-channel processing at 192kHz/64-bit resolution. The company's power supply designs feature advanced 1MHz switching regulators with discrete linear stabilizers, representing high-end engineering approaches. Their proprietary DSP Tools software and modular architecture design show meaningful technical innovation beyond off-the-shelf implementations.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

RESOLUT products demonstrate poor cost-performance ratios. Taking the M-DSP at 6,280 USD as the primary evaluation target, the Zapco HDSP-Z16 V AD-16G offers equivalent 16-channel functionality with ES9038PRO DAC at 3,885 USD [2]. Equipped with 16-channel DSP processing, ES9038PRO DAC, and comparable high-resolution capabilities, the Zapco provides equivalent-or-better performance. CP calculation: 3,885 USD ÷ 6,280 USD = 0.6.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

RESOLUT suffers from significant reliability and support issues. User reports indicate widespread hardware problems, with one dealer noting "all 4 units had issues" out of their received stock [3]. Users report compatibility problems including being "fussy about coax sources" and "lots of bugs" in operation [3]. The company provides limited global support infrastructure, with users reporting "no support" availability [3]. While Japanese distribution is handled by E:S Corporation providing some local support, the overall reliability track record and support system remain problematic.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.9} $$

RESOLUT's design philosophy demonstrates strong scientific rationality. The company focuses on measurable technical improvements through sophisticated dual-DAC architectures, high-resolution processing capabilities, and advanced power supply designs. They avoid occult audio claims while directing resources toward quantifiable performance enhancements. The progressive adoption of contemporary DAC technologies (ES9038PRO, ES9028PRO) and proprietary algorithm development shows rational engineering approaches aimed at transparent audio reproduction.

## Advice

RESOLUT represents a technically sophisticated but commercially problematic choice for high-end DSP applications. While their engineering approach demonstrates genuine technical merit with dual-DAC implementations and advanced processing capabilities, the cost premium cannot be justified given equivalent alternatives at substantially lower prices. The M-DSP at 6,280 USD costs 62% more than the equivalent Zapco alternative at 3,885 USD. More critically, widespread reliability issues including "all 4 units had issues" reports from dealers [3], combined with limited global support infrastructure, make RESOLUT a high-risk investment despite technical sophistication. Consider established alternatives like Zapco HDSP-Z16 V AD-16G for premium performance with better reliability and support.
