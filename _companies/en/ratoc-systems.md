## Overview

RATOC Systems, Inc. (株式会社ラトックシステム) was founded in 1983 and is based in Osaka, Japan. Originally established as a PC interface products manufacturer, the company has over 37 years of experience in PCMCIA products and PCI interface board technologies. RATOC operates their audio division under the "RATOC Audio Lab" (RAL) brand, which emerged from their PC peripheral design expertise. Their primary audio products include the RAL-24192DM1 DAC, RAL-24192HA1 DAC/headphone amplifier, and RAL-2496UT1 USB-DAC/amplifier, all emphasizing R2R DAC technology and direct hardware control approaches.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

RATOC Audio Lab products demonstrate adequate measured performance based on available manufacturer specifications. The RAL-24192DM1 and RAL-24192HA1 achieve S/N ratios of 106dB (line output) and 98dB (headphone output), with line output exceeding the transparent level threshold (105dB) and headphone output approaching it. Rated output specifications show 2Vrms (analog output) and 90mW at 16Ω (headphone output) with frequency response spanning DC to 90kHz during 192kHz operation. However, as these are manufacturer-only specifications without third-party verification, conservative evaluation adjustment is applied per policy requirements. The PCM1704-based multi-bit DAC architecture provides theoretical advantages in linearity, though actual implementation performance remains unverified through independent measurements [1].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

RATOC Systems demonstrates moderate technology implementation focused on legacy R2R DAC architecture. Their approach centers on PCM1704 multi-bit DACs with dedicated dual crystal oscillators (24.576MHz and 22.5792MHz) for low-jitter clock generation. The company emphasizes direct firmware control of DACs, avoiding traditional digital filter chips like DF1704, requiring custom firmware development. Their engineering shows competent analog design with separated power supply circuits and impedance-controlled PCB layout. However, the technology lacks proprietary patents, significant competitive advantage, or meaningful technical differentiation that would be desirable for other manufacturers to adopt. The PCM1704-based approach represents mature technology from the 1990s without substantial modernization or innovation beyond standard implementation, limiting technical sophistication compared to contemporary DAC solutions utilizing advanced delta-sigma architectures and integrated digital processing capabilities [2].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

RATOC Audio Lab products demonstrate poor cost-performance due to their discontinued status making them uncompetitive with current market alternatives. While the RAL-24192DM1 was historically priced as a premium product, modern alternatives like the Schiit Modi+ (129 USD) offer equivalent-or-better functionality with USB/optical/coaxial inputs, 24-bit/192kHz support, ESS DAC implementation, and verified measured performance through Audio Science Review validation. Additional budget options like the Fosi Audio Q4 (approximately 50 USD) provide equivalent PCM decoding capabilities with 0.01% THD and comprehensive input options at significantly lower cost points. The discontinuation of RATOC Audio Lab products eliminates price competitiveness entirely, as consumers cannot access these products through normal retail channels while equivalent or superior alternatives remain readily available at lower price points [3][4].

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

RATOC Systems maintains adequate reliability standards with 37+ years of established engineering experience in digital interface products. The company provides English-language support infrastructure through official website contact systems. Their analog-focused DAC designs feature simpler construction with fewer complex digital components, potentially improving long-term reliability. However, major products including RAL-24192DM1 have been discontinued, significantly limiting ongoing support potential. The company maintains membership in relevant technical associations (PCMCIA, USB IF Compliance Program) and demonstrates consistent engineering standards across their product portfolio [5].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

RATOC Audio Lab's design philosophy prioritizes subjective audio preferences over measurable performance improvements, lacking scientific rationality. The company deliberately avoids proven digital processing technologies such as oversampling and digital filters, favoring direct DAC control for claimed "pure and natural sound" benefits that remain unverified through measurement. Their emphasis on R2R technology represents performance regression compared to modern delta-sigma implementations in objective metrics. While showing innovation through custom firmware solutions, the overall approach emphasizes vintage technology and subjective audio mythology rather than pursuing transparent audio reproduction through measurement-verified improvements [6].

## Advice

RATOC Systems products are not recommended for new purchases due to discontinued status and limited market availability. While their audio products demonstrated competent technical specifications during production, including S/N ratios exceeding transparency thresholds, the discontinuation eliminates warranty support and future firmware updates. The company's R2R DAC approach showed technical merit but lacks the ongoing development and market presence of current alternatives. Potential buyers seeking high-fidelity audio reproduction should consider currently manufactured alternatives from established manufacturers like Schiit Audio, offering equivalent functionality, active support, and guaranteed availability of replacement units.
