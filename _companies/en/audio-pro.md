## Overview

Audio-Pro is a Swedish speaker manufacturer founded in 1978. The company is characterized by the ACE-BASS technology developed by founder Karl-Erik Steil, which enables deep bass reproduction even in compact sizes. Currently sold in over 55 countries, Audio-Pro specializes in active speakers, portable speakers, and multiroom systems. They offer flagship products including the T3+, C10 MKII, and A26, with standard integration of three connectivity methods: AirPlay 2, Google Cast, and their proprietary multiroom system.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Regarding Audio-Pro's flagship product C10 MKII, while DXOMark measurements show an overall score of 136, verification of detailed technical specifications reveals numerous problems. The frequency response is listed as 60-20,000Hz, but detailed data on actual flatness and distortion rates are not disclosed, making it unclear whether transparency standards are met. The T3+ features a 25W Class D amplifier, but important measurement values such as THD+N, SNR, and IMD are unpublished, preventing scientific verification. DXOMark reviews point out midrange opacity and insufficient high-frequency brightness, making achievement of transparency levels unlikely.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The ACE-BASS technology is proprietary technology developed in 1978, but currently does not exceed the scope of conventional bass reflex design. While industry-standard technologies such as Class D amplifier adoption and multiroom compatibility have been introduced, no revolutionary technological innovations contributing to improved measurement performance are evident. DSP adjustment for sound quality improvement is claimed, but specific technical content and performance improvement data are unclear, with evident gaps from industry-leading standards. Design originality and patent technology presence are also limited in public information, and academic backing through technical papers cannot be confirmed.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

For the C10 MKII's US price of 480 USD, comparison with the equivalent-function Edifier R1700BTs (200 USD) yields 200 USD รท 480 USD = 0.417. Audio-Pro's T3+ portable speaker also lacks price advantage compared to JBL Charge 5 (approximately 140 USD) or Anker Soundcore Motion+ (approximately 100 USD). Regarding multiroom functionality, Edifier products with equivalent connectivity are available at less than half the price. As 25W output active speakers, YAMAHA HS5 (approximately 200 USD) and KRK Rokit 5 G4 (approximately 160 USD) offer superior measurement performance while being significantly cheaper.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Sales presence in 55 countries and over 40 years of corporate history indicate some degree of reliability, but specific failure rate data and MTBF values are not disclosed. Details about warranty periods and repair systems are unclear, making objective evaluation of international support system quality impossible. Firmware updates appear to be supported, but clear information about update frequency and support duration is unavailable. In the Japanese market, sales are conducted through distributors like Avac, so direct manufacturer support cannot be expected.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

While the corporate philosophy of "high-quality sound at fair prices" is understandable, actual products show insufficient transparency in measurement performance, with unclear commitment to scientifically-based sound quality improvement. Multiroom functionality implementation is modern, but many products show weak necessity for existing as dedicated equipment compared to general-purpose devices (smartphones + external DAC/amp) that achieve the same functionality more affordably. ACE-BASS technology dates to 1978 and holds no special advantage by current standards. Non-disclosure of measurement data makes objective evaluation difficult, and lack of transparency is irrational.

## Advice

While Audio-Pro is a historic brand, objective assessment of current technical standards and pricing makes it unrecommendable. With the same budget, we strongly recommend choosing products with superior measurement performance such as Edifier R1700BTs or YAMAHA HS5. Even when multiroom functionality is required, combinations of general-purpose streamers like WiiM Pro or Chromecast Audio with high-performance active speakers can achieve higher sound quality within the same budget. For portable speakers, JBL Charge 5 and Anker products offer significantly superior price-to-performance ratios. It is important to avoid being misled by brand image and conduct calm comparison of measurement data and prices.
