## Overview

MADOO is a Japanese earphone brand established in 2021 by an engineer with ODM/OEM background for Acoustune, focusing on multi-driver configurations and long-serviceable builds. Manufacturing and design emphasize rigid metal housings, sapphire-crystal windows, and the Pentaconn Ear connector standard. Typ711 (3 micro planar + 2 BA) and Typ512 (micro planar + “Belix” UHD dynamic) are the current flagships. Sapphire parts are made in Japan by Adamant Namiki; product specs list 16 Ω (Typ711) and 32 Ω (Typ512), with 20 Hz–20 kHz / 20 Hz–40 kHz stated bandwidths. [1][2][3]

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Third-party measurement evidence is partial. Typ711 has an independently published frequency-response (FR) curve on an IEC 60318-4 (711) coupler showing a sub-bass emphasis with broadly conventional upper-mid/treble structure. Typ512 lacks published third-party FR/THD/IMD datasets; most data are manufacturer specs. Warranty is documented, but lab-level distortion or unit-to-unit consistency figures are not. Given one model with public FR and otherwise sparse hard data (no THD/IMD, crosstalk, isolation numbers), we assign a slightly-above-baseline 0.6. [2][4]

Specifics cited (manufacturer): Typ711 16 Ω, 20 Hz–20 kHz; Typ512 32 Ω, 20 Hz–40 kHz. [1][2]

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

MADOO deploys distinctive engineering: micro “planar dynamic” (Micro Square PM) drivers, a bespoke Belix diaphragm (magnesium-lithium dome bonded to a beryllium-deposited edge), 3D-printed acoustic blocks (MIAA) with precisely controlled passages, and second-order crossovers using AVX capacitors. Rigid housings are CNC-milled with tight tolerances, and sapphire-crystal windows double as a pressure-control element. The component choices and mechanical execution are advanced for the category. [1][2]

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

Representative products & market pricing (USD): Typ711 at **1,599.99 USD** and Typ512 at **649 USD**. For an equal-or-better baseline, the **7Hz Timeless II** (14.5 mm planar, THD < 0.2% @ 1 kHz per manufacturer) is widely available at **229 USD** and is documented by multiple third-party impressions as a neutral-leaning, technically solid planar benchmark. Using that as the lowest-cost “does not underperform” comparator:

- Product-level CP: Typ711 ≈ **0.1**, Typ512 ≈ **0.4** (based on the above market prices and comparator).
- Company CP (simple average across these two staples): **0.3**.

Japanese domestic list prices referenced for context: Typ711 899 USD; Typ512 667 USD (historical retail). CP scoring here uses USD to maintain cross-market comparability. [2][5][6][7][8][9][10]

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

Build choices (stainless/aluminum shells, sapphire windows, Pentaconn Ear) and a **1-year** main-unit warranty are positives. That said, MADOO is a young brand with limited international service footprints; official contact is via web form with responses coordinated by a domestic distributor. Clear global RMA logistics outside Asia are not detailed. Retail availability exists through specialty shops in Hong Kong/Singapore and select online outlets. [1][2][10]

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

The design narrative is coherent: rigid housings, controlled internal acoustics (MIAA), and material science (Belix) are plausibly linked to measurable behavior (resonance control, FR shaping). The sapphire window doubles as both aesthetic and pressure-management element. While the approach is technically thoughtful, price positioning outpaces verifiable performance data, constraining the practical payoff for most buyers. [1][2]

## Advice

If you value distinctive materials and boutique Japanese build, MADOO is appealing. If your priority is performance per dollar, start with a planar benchmark like **7Hz Timeless II** and audition MADOO against it—especially Typ512 versus Timeless II—before committing. [5][6]
