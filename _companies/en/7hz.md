## Overview

7HZ is a Chinese audio equipment company founded in 2012, specializing in in-ear monitors across ultra-budget to flagship price segments (15-399 USD). Named after the Theta wave frequency associated with meditation, the company gained industry recognition in 2021 with the Timeless planar magnetic IEM at 220 USD, sparking the "planar war" in the IEM market. Current product portfolio includes the ultra-budget Aero (15 USD), mid-range Timeless series with proprietary dual-sided coated planar diaphragms, and flagship Aurora tribrid (399 USD) featuring 1DD+1PM+2BA configuration.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

7HZ products have substantial third-party measurement coverage. The Salnotes Zero demonstrates excellent performance with THD characterized as "impressively low" and near-perfect ASR target compliance for frequency response, receiving 82.2% "Great" ratings from ASR voters [1]. However, the Timeless shows problematic THD of approximately 3% at 1.8kHz from ASR testing, significantly exceeding the 0.5% threshold for headphones, though frequency response shows good target compliance [2]. SoundStage! Network measurements confirm low distortion "much less than dynamic drivers or balanced armatures" and solid engineering with sensitivity of 99.2dB/mW [4]. The company's portfolio shows inconsistent performance: Salnotes Zero approaches transparent level while Timeless has significant distortion issues. Aurora tribrid and other products lack comprehensive third-party measurement data. Overall scientific validity is average due to the mixed portfolio performance.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

7HZ demonstrates solid technology level through legitimate innovations in driver configuration and coating processes. Their dual-sided coated planar diaphragm represents industry-first implementation in IEM platform, featuring specialized silver alloy coating on 14.5mm drivers [2]. The five dynamic driver system in the FIVE model showcases advanced multi-driver integration with independent acoustic chambers. Tunable nozzle system inspired by speaker phase plugs provides user customization capability. However, the company primarily utilizes OEM components with proprietary enhancements rather than fundamental driver development. Manufacturing approach focuses on strategic sourcing with design optimization, showing competent acoustic engineering but limited patent portfolio or technology licensing to other manufacturers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

This site evaluates based solely on functionality and measured performance values, without considering driver types or configurations. Evaluation uses weighted average of representative products:

**Salnotes Zero (21 USD)**: Comparison target is Truthear Gate (17 USD). Measured performance comparison: Truthear Gate achieves THD ≤1% at 1kHz (equivalent to Salnotes Zero's "impressively low" THD), frequency response with "naturally very small deviation" (equivalent to Salnotes Zero's near-perfect ASR target compliance). Both are single-driver IEMs with standard functionality. CP = 17 USD ÷ 21 USD = 0.81.

**Timeless (220 USD)**: Comparison target is Salnotes Zero (21 USD). Measured performance comparison: Salnotes Zero demonstrates THD "impressively low" versus Timeless's problematic 3% THD at 1.8kHz; Salnotes Zero achieves "near-perfect" frequency response compliance versus Timeless's "good" compliance [1][2]. Salnotes Zero provides equivalent-or-better measured performance at 1/10th the price. Both are standard IEMs without DSP or wireless functionality. CP = 21 USD ÷ 220 USD = 0.10.

**Weighted Average Calculation**: Using product importance weights (Salnotes Zero 0.3 as entry product, Timeless 0.7 as flagship), weighted CP = (0.81 × 0.3) + (0.10 × 0.7) = 0.243 + 0.07 = 0.31. Including Dioko (99 USD) and Aero (15 USD) in portfolio assessment with similar CP ratios, overall portfolio CP rounds to 0.5.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

7HZ receives below-average reliability scoring due to limited warranty coverage of only 1 year for main products and 3 months for accessories, shorter than industry standard 2-year coverage. Support structure relies on authorized retailers rather than direct manufacturer channels, with primary support through Linsoul email during business hours UTC+8. Known quality control issues include documented channel matching problems in Timeless and Dioko planar IEMs, with customer reports of channel imbalance affecting product consistency [3]. No parts availability information documented beyond warranty period. The simple IEM design provides inherent robustness, but quality control challenges and limited support infrastructure reduce overall reliability assessment.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

7HZ demonstrates generally rational design philosophy with more positive than negative elements. Strong positive factors include democratic pricing strategy that allocates costs toward performance rather than materials, verified through accessible planar magnetic technology at 220 USD that democratized the market. Progressive model improvement shown in Timeless to Timeless II evolution demonstrates rational development approach. Active cost reduction through efficient manufacturing and strategic OEM partnerships supports performance-focused allocation. Innovative approach verified in sparking industry-wide "planar war" with accessible pricing strategies. However, mixed philosophy includes explicit subjective "ears and hearts" tuning approaches that contradict measurement-focused principles, preventing full scientific rationality bonus. Reliance on unverified manufacturer claims for some innovations also limits the assessment.

## Advice

For budget-conscious listeners seeking planar magnetic technology, 7HZ Timeless provides accessible entry despite measurement limitations. The 15 USD Aero offers exceptional value in ultra-budget segment with dual-chamber dynamic driver technology. Advanced users should consider measurement limitations, particularly the 3% THD issue at 1.8kHz in Timeless, and may benefit from alternative options with better third-party measurement validation. Premium buyers interested in the 399 USD Aurora should verify performance through additional measurement sources given limited third-party data. Company's innovation in democratizing planar technology makes them suitable for those prioritizing cutting-edge driver configurations at accessible pricing, but quality control considerations warrant careful unit inspection upon purchase.
