summary: "Founded in China in 2012, 7HZ is an emerging company that revolutionized the planar magnetic IEM market. The massive success of the Timeless demonstrated the potential of planar IEMs in the 220USD price bracket to the world. While technically utilizing existing planar drivers with limited proprietary design, they maintain some competitiveness in price-to-performance. However, with equivalent-performance Chinese IEMs available at similar prices, their absolute advantage remains limited."

## Overview

7HZ is a Chinese audio company established in 2012, specializing in IEMs (In-Ear Monitors). Named after the "Theta Wave" 7Hz frequency associated with meditation and harmony, the company aims to provide deep relaxation and musical immersion. The 2021 launch of the Timeless demonstrated the viability of planar magnetic IEMs in the 220USD price bracket, leading the revolution in the planar IEM market. Currently, they actively engage in collaborative development with renowned audio critics, such as the 7HZ x Crinacle Zero series.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.8} $$

7HZ's flagship product, the Timeless, features a 14.2mm planar magnetic driver achieving measurable performance improvements including THD 0.2% (1kHz) and 5Hz-40kHz frequency response. The planar magnetic technology enables low distortion and high-resolution reproduction that would be difficult with conventional dynamic drivers, with these effects confirmed by actual measurement data. However, there are channel matching accuracy issues, with left-right differences in upper midrange and treble frequencies reported across multiple units. Measurement results are also available on Crinacle's IEM database, enabling objective evaluation.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

7HZ employs 14.2mm planar magnetic drivers with ultra-thin 2mm diaphragms and powerful neodymium magnets. However, this is essentially a design using OEM planar drivers, with limited proprietary technology development. While the CNC aluminum shell machining precision is good and MMCX connector adoption provides high practicality, fundamental technological innovation or proprietary acoustic design theory is not evident. The company's technical standards exceed industry average, but in terms of proprietary technology development capabilities, no significant difference is seen compared to other Chinese IEM manufacturers.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The 7HZ Timeless sells for 220USD, certainly a competitive price in the planar magnetic IEM market. However, competing products with equivalent performance exist at lower prices, including the Letshuoer S12 (under 200USD), Tangzu Ze Tian Wu (under 200USD), and KZ PR1 (70USD). These products also feature 14-15mm planar drivers and achieve similar measured performance. Particularly, the KZ PR1 at 70USD features a 13.2mm planar driver, providing equivalent technology at approximately one-third the price of the Timeless. CP = 70USD รท 220USD = 0.32, indicating limited absolute price advantage.

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

7HZ provides a 1-year product warranty and deploys warranty services through various retail partners. In quality control, they implement 1-3 business days of quality inspection before shipping, with long-term quality maintenance also reported by users. However, channel matching issues in upper midrange and treble frequencies have occurred across multiple Timeless units, confirming some quality control challenges. As a Chinese company, they maintain standard warranty and support systems, though long-term support compared to European and American companies remains somewhat unclear.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

7HZ's design philosophy shows some rationality in democratizing planar magnetic technology. They contributed to market democratization by introducing planar IEMs, previously limited to high-price segments, into the mid-price range. The adoption of the large 14.2mm driver size, securing physical advantages, is reasonable design. However, proprietary acoustic theory or innovative design approaches are not evident, remaining limited to product development through combinations of existing technologies. The company name "7Hz" is also a marketing element without acoustic basis, showing aspects that prioritize branding over scientific rationality.

## Advice

7HZ is a suitable choice for beginners wanting to experience planar magnetic IEMs at an affordable price. The Timeless particularly provides sufficient performance as an entry-level planar technology device. However, for those seeking the best cost-performance, we strongly recommend considering equivalent-performance but significantly cheaper alternatives like the KZ PR1 (70USD) or Letshuoer S12. For long-term use, it's important to consider the possibility of channel matching issues and conduct pre-purchase auditions or quality verification within the warranty period. This company is suitable for users who prioritize practical sound quality improvement over technological innovation or brand value.
