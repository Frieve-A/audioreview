## Overview

Marantz Professional became part of inMusic Brands on April 15, 2014, when inMusic added Denon Professional, Marantz Professional, and Denon DJ to its portfolio [1][2]. Today the lineup centers on USB/podcast microphones and related streaming gear, while the PMD handheld field recorders are largely in the Legacy category. Beyond this historical note, the following evaluations focus strictly on current, measurable performance.

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Representative data for the company’s recent/legacy field recorder shows limited headroom to modern transparency targets. The PMD661MKIII (24-bit/96 kHz) is specified at THD 0.08 % (mic in), SNR 65 dB A-weighted (mic in), and dynamic range 85 dB [3]. These values sit well below transparency-level goals (e.g., SNR ≈105 dB class, THD ≤0.01 %). On the USB side, the still-sold MPM-1000U specifies 16-bit/48 kHz conversion and SNR 78 dB with 16 dBA self-noise [6]—adequate for entry-level voice but again short of transparent benchmarks. In short, available specs indicate performance from “problematic to average” for critical work [3][6].

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.3} $$

The active lineup (e.g., MPM-1000U) relies on mature 16-bit/48 kHz USB implementations and conventional analog front-ends; the brand has not broadly adopted recent 32-bit float workflows or distinctive DSP/network integrations seen elsewhere. Innovation cadence appears conservative with incremental updates rather than state-of-the-art advances [6].

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.7} $$

**Company-level CP** is computed from weighted representative products (selection reasons stated; prices are actual market prices in USD). We pick (A) the flagship legacy field recorder that defines the brand identity and remains available refurbished, and (B) a current USB/podcast mic that reflects today’s lineup.

- **A. PMD661MKIII (refurb)** — typical refurbished street **259.99 USD** [4].  
  **Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **Zoom H4essential 32-bit float recorder** at **219.99 USD** (adds 32-bit float capture, 2 combo XLR/TRS with +48 V, 4-track mode; user-visible functions and recording headroom are equal-or-better versus a 2-ch 24-bit PMD) [5].  
  **CP_A = 219.99 / 259.99 = 0.85**.

- **B. MPM-1000U USB mic (current)** — typical price **49.00 USD** [7].  
  **Cheapest equivalent-or-better comparator:** **FIFINE K669/K669B** at **29.99 USD** with the same 16-bit/48 kHz conversion and published **S/N 78 dB** (equal S/N to MPM-1000U; user-facing function is equivalent) [6][8].  
  **CP_B = 29.99 / 49.00 = 0.61**.

**Weighting & result.** Because the field recorder line is now Legacy while USB/podcast is the active commercial focus, we weight **A: 30 %** and **B: 70 %**.  
Weighted CP = 0.30×0.85 + 0.70×0.61 = **0.68 → 0.7** (rounded to 0.1).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Warranty terms for Marantz Professional indicate **1-year limited warranty** for portable/Pro products [11]. Separate documents specify **2-year coverage for installation (rackmount) products** [12]. Support is handled via inMusic’s network and a centralized knowledge base; with many PMD/Audio Scope models categorized as **Legacy/Discontinued** on the official site and support portal, long-term firmware/support prospects for field recorders are modest [13][14].

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

The product strategy emphasizes conventional standalone hardware (SD-based recorders, basic USB mics) with limited integration of newer approaches (32-bit float across the board, advanced DSP/networked audio, or deep software workflows). For buyers optimizing transparency per dollar, general-purpose alternatives or newer recorders tend to offer clearer measured gains.

## Advice

If you need a compact recorder today, **Zoom H4essential (219.99 USD)** offers modern 32-bit float capture with dual XLR/TRS and strong utility for significantly less than typical refurbished PMD pricing [5]. For two-channel 32-bit float with ultra-low noise in a tiny form factor, **Zoom F3** is an option (commonly **329.99 USD** at major U.S. retailers) [9][10]. If you’re considering a Marantz USB mic for entry-level voice, note that multiple competitors match or exceed its published specs at lower prices (e.g., **FIFINE K669B 29.99 USD**) [6][8][7].
