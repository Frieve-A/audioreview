## Overview

Poppulse is a small Hong Kong–based audio brand best known for Tripath “Class T” amplifiers (e.g., TA2022–based designs) and a handful of DACs. Distribution appears to be limited and largely through third-party retailers (e.g., Audiophonics in the EU) rather than an official global channel [1].

## Scientific Validity

$$ \Large \text{0.5} $$

Public, lab-grade measurements for Poppulse products are scarce. For the TA2022 platform commonly used in the lineup, the chipset’s datasheet specifies THD+N figures such as 0.015% at 45W/8Ω (and 70W/4Ω) and a dynamic range specification of 102 dB [2]. Retailer listings for the T180 amplifier echo low-distortion claims consistent with those chipset figures [1]. Community posts exist for the T180 “MD version,” but they are informal rather than standardized bench testing [3]. Given the lack of comprehensive independent data across the product range, the baseline assessment remains provisional at 0.5.

## Technology Level

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

Designs rely on mature, off-the-shelf ICs (Tripath TA2022 for amps; past DACs used Wolfson/ESS parts). Occasional part upgrades (op-amps/capacitors) are incremental rather than novel architectures. There is no visible original DSP/firmware ecosystem or distinctive IP. Competent implementation of established switching-amp topologies, but not state-of-the-art.

## Cost-Performance

$$ \Large \text{0.1} $$

Reference target: Poppulse T180 currently listed at **399 € ≈ USD 440** in the EU market [1].  
Cheapest equal-or-better comparator (functions & measured performance): **Aiyima A07/A07 Premium (TPA3255)** at **USD 60.99** from the manufacturer store [5], with credible third-party measurements available [4]. Rationale for equivalence: both are two-channel compact power amplifiers with comparable user-facing functionality and low-distortion, wide-band performance validated for the comparator.

CP calculation (display requirement): **60.99 ÷ 440 = 0.139…** → **score 0.1** (rounded to one decimal).

## Reliability & Support

$$ \Large \text{0.4} $$

No active global support structure is evident; distribution and after-sales appear reseller-centric. Some older products (e.g., WM8741 DAC) are flagged discontinued at retail [6], while T180 remains orderable at time of writing [1]. With sparse official communications and limited warranty visibility, support is below average versus larger brands.

## Rationality of Design Philosophy

$$ \Large \text{0.6} $$

The emphasis on objectively measurable Class-T/Class-D–style efficiency and linearity is rational and avoids myth-driven features. However, lack of innovation beyond proven IC-centric builds and limited system-level integration caps the score.

## Advice

If you specifically want a Tripath-flavored implementation and accept limited support visibility, Poppulse may appeal. For most buyers, modern alternatives with stronger independent measurements, lower prices, and broader support—e.g., **Aiyima A07** or **Fosi ZA3**—are safer picks.
